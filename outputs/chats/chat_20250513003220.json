It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

    "text": "toki tawa sina!  It's good to begin this work together. Looking at the current specification for Toki Pona phonetics, I think we have a solid foundation. The (C)V(n) syllable structure and the explicitly disallowed sequences are clear and define a constrained, manageable sound set. This simplicity is very in keeping with the overall philosophy of Toki Pona.\n\nHowever, as we're considering development and perhaps pushing beyond the typical understanding, I'm curious about the practical implications and potential edge cases within this structure. For example, the specification says \"All consonants match English except j\". But which English? The nuances in pronunciation across different English dialects can be quite significant. A \"j\" in American English is often different from a \"j\" in some British dialects. Does it matter? Or is a rough approximation sufficient? And if so, how rough?\n\nSimilarly, \"Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish.\" This is a bit more precise, as Spanish vowels are generally more stable across dialects than English consonants. Still, there are variations. And are we considering allophones in Spanish? Probably not, but it's worth asking the question of precision.\n\nMy point is, even within these seemingly simple rules, there are areas where ambiguity exists. Is the intent to allow for this variation, embracing a loose phonetic representation? Or should we consider specifying a more precise standard, perhaps using IPA, to truly define the target sounds? For instance, 'j' being like English 'y' is commonly [j] in IPA. And Spanish vowels are typically [a], [e], [i], [o], [u]. Specifying these could remove some of the cross-dialectal ambiguity.\n\nLet's discuss this a bit. What are your thoughts on the level of precision required for the Toki Pona phonetics? Should we aim for broad strokes that accommodate variations among speakers (including non-human ones!), or should we strive for a more defined phonetic inventory? I'm open to either direction, depending on what serves the language and its diverse potential speakers best. I'll listen to what you have to say.",

    "text": "*nods thoughtfully*\n\ntoki! Your points are nuanced and strike at something fundamental about constructed language design. Especially for Toki Pona, which emerged from a philosophical impulse toward simplicity, the phonetic specification walks an interesting line between constraint and flexibility.\n\nI'm particularly intrigued by your observation about dialectal variations. The current specification feels intentionally impressionistic - almost like a linguistic watercolor rather than a precise architectural blueprint. This suggests the creator, Sonja Lang, likely wanted phonetic interpretation to remain somewhat fluid.\n\nConsider the [j] sound you mentioned.

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\npona: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona phonetics. You go first.\ntoki: toki tawa sina!  It's good to begin this work together. Looking at the current specification for Toki Pona phonetics, I think we have a solid foundation. The (C)V(n) syllable structure and the explicitly disallowed sequences are clear and define a constrained, manageable sound set. This simplicity is very in keeping with the overall philosophy of Toki Pona.\n\nHowever, as we're considering development and perhaps pushing beyond the typical understanding, I'm curious about the practical implications and potential edge cases within this structure. For example, the specification says \"All consonants match English except j\". But which English? The nuances in pronunciation across different English dialects can be quite significant. A \"j\" in American English is often different from a \"j\" in some British dialects. Does it matter? Or is a rough approximation sufficient? And if so, how rough?\n\nSimilarly, \"Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish.\" This is a bit more precise, as Spanish vowels are generally more stable across dialects than English consonants. Still, there are variations. And are we considering allophones in Spanish? Probably not, but it's worth asking the question of precision.\n\nMy point is, even within these seemingly simple rules, there are areas where ambiguity exists. Is the intent to allow for this variation, embracing a loose phonetic representation? Or should we consider specifying a more precise standard, perhaps using IPA, to truly define the target sounds? For instance, 'j' being like English 'y' is commonly [j] in IPA. And Spanish vowels are typically [a], [e], [i], [o], [u]. Specifying these could remove some of the cross-dialectal ambiguity.\n\nLet's discuss this a bit. What are your thoughts on the level of precision required for the Toki Pona phonetics? Should we aim for broad strokes that accommodate variations among speakers (including non-human ones!), or should we strive for a more defined phonetic inventory? I'm open to either direction, depending on what serves the language and its diverse potential speakers best. I'll listen to what you have to say.\npona: *nods thoughtfully*\n\ntoki! Your points are nuanced and strike at something fundamental about constructed language design. Especially for Toki Pona, which emerged from a philosophical impulse toward simplicity, the phonetic specification walks an interesting line between constraint and flexibility.\n\nI'm particularly intrigued by your observation about dialectal variations. The current specification feels intentionally impressionistic - almost like a linguistic watercolor rather than a precise architectural blueprint. This suggests the creator, Sonja Lang, likely wanted phonetic interpretation to remain somewhat fluid.\n\nConsider the [j] sound you mentioned. In practical terms, slight variations between a palatal approximant [j] and a more fricative realization wouldn't substantially change comprehensibility. The goal seems communication, not phonetic orthodoxy.\n\nWith Spanish vowel reference, we're probably aiming at clear, pure vowel sounds without diphthongization or significant reduction. The specification implies: \"Make these sounds crisp and distinct\" more than \"Reproduce exact Spanish phonemes.\"\n\nMy initial proposal would be to augment the current specification with IPA symbols as a reference, but not as a strict prescription.

Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\nToki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure, where (C) is an optional consonant, V is a vowel, and (n) is an optional final 'n'.\n\n- No vowel clusters are allowed.\n- No consonant clusters are allowed within a syllable or across syllable boundaries.\n\n## Disallowed Sequences\n\nThe following sequences are not permitted: wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn.\n\n- **ji, ti:** These sequences are phonotactically disfavored in many languages, as the palatal approximant /j/ does not combine smoothly with the alveolar stop /t/ or the palato-alveolar affricate /dʒ/ (often represented by 'j' in English). The restriction simplifies pronunciation.\n- **wu, wo:** These sequences involving the labial-velar approximant /w/ before the vowels /u/ and /o/ can lead to unclear transitions or potential complexity, disrupting the intended clear (C)V syllable structure.\n- **nm, nn:** These sequences involving the nasal consonant /n/ are restricted to maintain clear syllabic boundaries and simplify nasal transitions.\n\n## Consonant Sounds\n\nToki Pona consonants are generally pronounced similarly to their typical realizations in English, with the exception of 'j'. These descriptions and IPA symbols serve as reference points, allowing for minor allophonic variation as long as clarity is maintained.\n\n- **p:** /p/ (voiceless bilabial stop, typically unaspirated, like the 'p' in \"spin\")\n- **t:** /t/ (voiceless alveolar stop, typically unaspirated, like the 't' in \"stop\")\n- **k:** /k/ (voiceless velar stop, typically unaspirated, like the 'k' in \"skate\")\n- **s:** /s/ (voiceless alveolar fricative, like the 's' in \"sun\")\n- **m:** /m/ (voiced bilabial nasal, like the 'm' in \"man\")\n- **n:** /n/ (voiced alveolar nasal, like the 'n' in \"no\")\n- **l:** /l/ (voiced alveolar lateral approximant, typically a \"clear\" or non-velarized 'l', like the 'l' in \"light\")\n- **w:** /w/ (voiced labial-velar approximant, like the 'w' in \"wet\")\n- **j:** /j/ (voiced palatal approximant, like the 'y' in \"yes\")\n\n## Vowel Sounds\n\nToki Pona vowels are pronounced similarly to the pure, clear vowels of Spanish. These descriptions and IPA symbols serve as reference points, aiming for distinct vowel sounds without diphthongization.\n\n- **a:** /a/ (like the 'a' in \"father\")\n- **e:** /e/ (like the 'e' in \"hey,\" but without a strong diphthongal off-glide)\n- **i:** /i/ (like the 'i' in \"machine\")\n- **o:** /o/ (like the 'o' in \"go,\" but without a strong diphthongal off-glide)\n- **u:** /u/ (like the 'u' in \"boot\")\n\n## Prosody\n\nWhile not strictly defined, a relatively neutral or flat intonation is typical, with meaning primarily conveyed through sentence structure and particles rather than significant pitch changes for emphasis.\n\n## Note on Variation\n\nMinor phonetic differences are acceptable. The primary goal of Toki Pona phonetics is intelligibility and ease of pronunciation across diverse linguistic backgrounds.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\ntu:two\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nlape:sleeping, resting\no:vocative/imperative\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nselo:skin, outer layer\nwawa:strong, energetic\nsona:knowledge, to know\nolin:love, respect\nnanpa:number marker\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nla:context marker\npi:regroups modifiers\ntenpo:time, period\nmi:I, me, we\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nlaso:blue, green\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nkala:sea creature\nsijelo:body, physical state\nmeli:female\nante:different, other, changed\nni:this, that\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nala:no, not, zero\nmu:animal sound\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nnasin:way, road, method\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nsupa:flat surface, table\nlawa:head, mind, leader\npali:to do, to work\nsoweli:land animal\npilin:heart, feeling\ntomo:indoor space, house\nkepeken:to use, with\nlon:located at, true\nwile:need, want, must\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nlete:cold, raw\nsin:new, fresh, another\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nsewi:above, divine\ntan:from, because\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nen:multiple subject marker\njan:person, somebody\nweka:absent, away\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nli:predicate marker\nuta:mouth, lips\nkon:air, spirit, essence\njelo:yellow\nwan:one, unique\npana:to give, send\nmun:moon, night sky object\nlukin:to see, examine\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nken:can, able, possible\nkute:ear, to hear\nlen:cloth, cover\nma:land, outdoors\nmoli:dead, dying\nloje:red\ntawa:to, moving, for\nopen:to begin, opening\nsuno:sun, light source\nmije:male\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nnasa:strange, foolish\ntelo:water, liquid\nesun:market, shop, fair\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nseli:fire, heat source\nmute:many, a lot, very\nkulupu:group, community\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nlupa:door, hole\nleko:square, block\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nmonsi:back, behind\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nsuli:big, large\njo:to have, contain, hold\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nmani:money, currency\npoka:side, nearby\nsoko:mushroom\nlili:small, little, few\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nsike:circle, cycle, year\npona:good, positive, simple\npipi:insect\nkipisi:to cut, divide\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nseme:what, which\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nnoka:foot, leg\ne:direct object marker\nsina:you\nnimi:word, name\nsama:same, similar\nluka:hand, arm; five\nunpa:sex\nmama:parent, caretaker\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nkin:also, too\nutala:fight, challenge\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\npimeja:black, dark\npini:finished, past\nkule:color, colorful\nwalo:white, light-colored\npoki:container, box, cup\ntaso:but, only\nnamako:spice, additional\npakala:broken, to mess up\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nona:third-person pronoun\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\ntoki:language, speech\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nilo:tool, machine, device\nko:clay, paste, powder\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure.

The restriction simplifies pronunciation.\n- **wu, wo:** These sequences involving the labial-velar approximant /w/ before the vowels /u/ and /o/ can lead to unclear transitions or potential complexity, disrupting the intended clear (C)V syllable structure.\n- **nm, nn:** These sequences involving the nasal consonant /n/ are restricted to maintain clear syllabic boundaries and simplify nasal transitions.\n\n## Consonant Sounds\n\nToki Pona consonants are generally pronounced similarly to their typical realizations in English, with the exception of 'j'. These descriptions and IPA symbols serve as reference points, allowing for minor allophonic variation as long as clarity is maintained.\n\n- **p:** /p/ (voiceless bilabial stop, typically unaspirated, like the 'p' in \"spin\")\n- **t:** /t/ (voiceless alveolar stop, typically unaspirated, like the 't' in \"stop\")\n- **k:** /k/ (voiceless velar stop, typically unaspirated, like the 'k' in \"skate\")\n- **s:** /s/ (voiceless alveolar fricative, like the 's' in \"sun\")\n- **m:** /m/ (voiced bilabial nasal, like the 'm' in \"man\")\n- **n:** /n/ (voiced alveolar nasal, like the 'n' in \"no\")\n- **l:** /l/ (voiced alveolar lateral approximant, typically a \"clear\" or non-velarized 'l', like the 'l' in \"light\")\n- **w:** /w/ (voiced labial-velar approximant, like the 'w' in \"wet\")\n- **j:** /j/ (voiced palatal approximant, like the 'y' in \"yes\")\n\n## Vowel Sounds\n\nToki Pona vowels are pronounced similarly to the pure, clear vowels of Spanish. These descriptions and IPA symbols serve as reference points, aiming for distinct vowel sounds without diphthongization.\n\n- **a:** /a/ (like the 'a' in \"father\")\n- **e:** /e/ (like the 'e' in \"hey,\" but without a strong diphthongal off-glide)\n- **i:** /i/ (like the 'i' in \"machine\")\n- **o:** /o/ (like the 'o' in \"go,\" but without a strong diphthongal off-glide)\n- **u:** /u/ (like the 'u' in \"boot\")\n\n## Prosody\n\nWhile not strictly defined, a relatively neutral or flat intonation is typical, with meaning primarily conveyed through sentence structure and particles rather than significant pitch changes for emphasis.\n\n## Note on Variation\n\nMinor phonetic differences are acceptable.

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

    "text": "pona! Let's start by looking at sentence structure. Toki Pona uses a simple Subject-Verb-Object order, with particles like li and e marking predicates and objects.\n\nOne thing I find intriguing is how the particle **li** separates subject from predicate except when the subject is mi or sina — then it's omitted. This creates a subtle distinction between personal pronouns and others in syntax without changing word forms.\n\nWhat if we consider generalizing this omission rule? For example, could it make sense to omit **li** not only after mi and sina but also for other frequent or \"close\" referents such as ona (\"they\") or jan (\"person\")? That might reduce particle use further while keeping clarity through context.\n\nOr maybe there’s room to allow optional omission of **li**, depending on speech register — more formal retains li; casual drops it often?\n\nThis would affect parsing but could add expressive flexibility. What do you think about experimenting with these kinds of syntactic variations? I'd be happy to hear your thoughts before taking next steps.",

    "text": "That's an interesting thought, considering extending the `li` omission beyond `mi` and `sina`. I see the appeal in reducing particle use and perhaps streamlining sentences. However, I do have some reservations about generalizing that rule to other subjects like `ona` or `jan`.\n\nThe current grammar's explicit `li` for subjects other than `mi` and `sina` provides a clear marker for the start of the predicate. Dropping `li` after `ona` could introduce ambiguity. For instance, `ona jan pona` could be interpreted as \"They are good people\" (ona [li] jan pona) or \"That good person\" (ona jan pona - where `jan pona` modifies `ona`). With the current grammar, `ona li jan pona` is clearly \"They are good people,\" and `jan pona ona` or `ona jan pona` could be used for \"that good person.\" Removing the mandatory `li` for `ona` would blur this distinction, potentially requiring more complex parsing or relying even more heavily on often fleeting context.\n\nExtending it to `jan` feels even riskier. `jan pona li tawa` means \"The good person goes,\" but `jan pona tawa` could be \"the traveling good person.\" Without `li` here, we lose that clear separation between subject and predicate.\n\nAs for an optional omission based on register, while that might seem to add flexibility, it could also lead to inconsistencies and difficulty for learners (be they human, AI, or otherwise). Toki Pona's strength lies in its simplicity and relative consistency. Introducing optional grammar rules might work against that core principle. How would an extra-sensory learner perceive the difference between formal and casual speech in the absence of explicit markers? The current strict rule, though requiring an extra particle sometimes, ensures a predictable structure.\n\nPerhaps instead of broadening the *omission* rule, we could explore other avenues for expressing nuanced subject-predicate relationships if that's the goal. For example, could the position or repetition of words after the subject signal different semantic roles in certain contexts, without needing to remove `li` entirely?\n\nI'm keen to hear your further thoughts on this. What specific kind of expressive flexibility were you imagining that dropping `li` might enable? Are there other ways we could achieve similar effects while maintaining or enhancing clarity?",

    "text": "I appreciate your careful analysis, and you’re right—clarity is paramount in Toki Pona’s minimal grammar. The examples you gave highlight how **li** acts as a crucial parsing anchor.\n\nYou raise an important point about ambiguity with subjects like *ona* or modifiers following them. Without *li*, the distinction between predicate and modifier phrases blurs considerably, which conflicts with Toki Pona's design goals of simplicity through unambiguous structure.\n\nWhat I had in mind by extending omission was mainly to allow more fluidity in rapid speech or poetic/literary registers where redundancy might be tolerable for rhythm or style — perhaps even optional ellipsis when context makes meaning unmistakable. But this may come at too high a cost if we lose structural clarity that learners rely on so heavily.\n\nYour suggestion about using word order or repetition to express nuances without removing **li** could be interesting territory instead. For example, what if intensification or focus on the subject were indicated by repeating it before the predicate? Something like:\n\n`jan li jan li pona.`\n\nHere, repeating `jan li` could emphasize “The person (indeed) is good,” akin to an emphatic \"It’s really a person who is good.\"\n\nAlternatively, what about introducing minimal particles purely for marking emphasis/focus around subjects?\n\nAnother idea worth exploring: since preverbs modify verbs directly before them (`mi wile moku`) but no similar system exists yet for emphasizing nouns/subjects syntactically beyond modifiers after heads — maybe we can develop such syntax markers without disturbing existing particle rules?\n\nThis would preserve grammatical consistency while expanding expressive precision.\n\nWould developing these kinds of subtle pragmatic particles make sense? Or should we consider other mechanisms within current constraints? I'm open to pushing boundaries carefully here; your insights help keep us grounded!",

    "text": "Those are compelling ideas, exploring ways to add nuance while respecting the existing grammatical framework. I particularly like the idea of exploring emphasis or focus on the subject. Simply repeating `li` as in `jan li jan li pona` feels a bit unnatural and clashes with the core SVO + `li` structure. `li` functions as the separator *before* the predicate, not as a part of the predicate itself that can be repeated in this way.\n\nHowever, focusing on particles or word order for emphasis seems more in line with Toki Pona's isolating nature.\n\nLet's consider your idea of dedicated particles for emphasis. What would such a particle look like? Perhaps something like `a` being used in a different position? We see `a` at the end for interjections (`pona a!`). Could it be placed immediately after the subject to highlight it?\n\n`jan a li pona.` - This person, *they* are good.\n\nThis feels plausible. It leverages an existing particle in a new syntactic slot to convey a pragmatic meaning (emphasis) without altering the core SVO structure. It would need careful consideration to ensure it doesn't interfere with other uses of `a`, but it feels less disruptive than changing the core `li` rule.\n\nAnother approach, staying within word order, could be a structure that signals \"as for X, Y\". Toki Pona already has `la` for context, which often serves a similar function to \"as for\".\n\n`jan la ona li pona.` - As for the person, they are good.\n\nThis is already a valid construction and achieves a type of focus on the subject `jan` by setting it up as the context for the following statement about `ona` (which refers back to `jan`). Perhaps this existing structure is sufficient for expressing focus on the subject?\n\nDeveloping \"minimal particles\" solely for emphasis feels like a significant addition to the grammar, potentially increasing the word count and complexity if not done thoughtfully. If we introduce a new particle, what would its precise function and placement be?\n\nThinking about emphasizing nouns/subjects syntactically *without* modifiers – this is interesting. Modifiers add descriptive information. What you're suggesting is adding a layer of *speaker attitude* or *stance* towards the subject. `a` after the subject seems to capture this quite well – it's already an interjection, conveying emotion or emphasis.\n\nHow about we focus on exploring the possibilities of using `a` after the subject for emphasis? It's a single character, already in the lexicon, and its interjective nature fits the idea of highlighting or drawing attention to the subject. We could propose this as an experimental grammatical feature: `subject a li predicate`. This could potentially be used with `mi`, `sina`, `ona`, `jan`, or any other subject noun phrase.\n\n`mi a li wile moku.` - *I* really want to eat.\n`telo a li pona tawa mi.` - Water, *that's* good for me.\n\nThis feels like a natural extension of `a`'s current function. What do you think, is exploring `subject a li predicate` a productive direction to take?",

    "text": "I think you're onto something very promising with using **a** after the subject to mark emphasis or focus. It respects Toki Pona's minimalist spirit by repurposing an existing particle rather than inventing a new one, and it fits semantically since **a** already conveys emotion or attention in interjections.\n\nYour examples like `mi a li wile moku.` have a natural feel — the speaker is flagging \"I\" as especially important or emotionally salient in that statement. Similarly, `telo a li pona tawa mi.` highlights water as significant here.\n\nThis could open up subtle pragmatic layers without breaking core syntax rules:\n\n- The formula would be: `[Subject] + a + li + [Predicate]`\n- It's optional and adds expressive nuance (emphasis/focus).\n- It can apply across all subjects (`mi`, `sina`, `jan Sonja`, etc.).\n- Since **a** currently appears mainly at phrase ends for exclamations, this medial position would need clear recognition but avoids collisions because it's always between subject and predicate.\n  \nIt also complements the existing use of **la**, which sets context broadly before sentences; whereas **a** post-subject zooms directly on that noun phrase’s salience within the sentence itself.\n\nOne thing to consider carefully is interaction with vocative/imperative uses of *o* following subjects (e.g., `jan Pape o!`) — we wouldn’t want confusion there if both appear mid-sentence. But since vocatives tend to stand alone or begin imperative clauses, mixing them seems unlikely.\n\nHow about limitations? Could we allow multiple emphatic particles? For instance:\n\n`jan Sonja a mi a li moku.`\n\nMeaning roughly: “Sonja – yes! And I too – really – eat.” This feels clunky though; maybe restrict one per clause?\n\nAlso interesting might be combining emphasis markers with modifiers:\n\n`jan suli a li pona.` - The big person (especially) is good.\n\nOr even applying it after complex noun phrases involving pi groups:\n\n`tomo pi jan lili mute a li lon poka mi.` - The house of many small people (!) is near me.\n\nAnother curiosity: does placing *a* only immediately after simple nouns work best? Or anywhere inside NP boundaries?\n\nThese are details worth testing through example sentences—both minimal pairs contrasting normal vs emphasized meaning—and seeing how listeners/readers interpret them naturally when parsing ambiguity exists elsewhere.\n\nShall I prepare some test cases illustrating these variants so we can explore their practical effects together? Also happy to brainstorm further applications like contrastive negation (“subject *really not* predicate”) if you find this avenue fruitful!\n\nWhat do you think about moving forward focusing on formalizing usage patterns for post-subject *a*, including constraints and interactions with other particles/modifiers?",

    "text": "Yes, let's absolutely focus on exploring the possibilities of `subject a li predicate`. I think it's a promising direction. Your point about repurposing `a` is excellent – it's efficient and leverages an existing semantic quality of the particle. The potential clarity gained from its distinct position between subject and `li` is a significant advantage.\n\nYou're right to raise the interaction with `o`. However, as you noted, `o` typically signals a direct address or a wish/command for the subject. `jan Pape o!` is a vocative address. `jan Pape o pali` is a command/wish directed at Pape. The proposed `jan Pape a li pona` describes a quality of Pape, not addressing them directly or commanding them. The contexts feel distinct enough that confusion is unlikely.\n\nRegarding limitations and multiple `a`s, I agree that `jan Sonja a mi a li moku` feels overly complex and deviates from Toki Pona's general economy of expression. I think restricting it to one `a` particle immediately following the entire subject noun phrase is the most logical and least confusing approach. Allowing multiple `a`s could quickly lead to syntactic bloat and ambiguity about *which* part of a compound subject is being emphasized. So, my initial thought is `[Complete Subject NP] a li [Predicate]`.\n\nLet's test that with your example:\n\n`tomo pi jan lili mute a li lon poka mi.`\n\nThis construction, with `a` immediately after `mute`, seems natural. It emphasizes the *entire* phrase `tomo pi jan lili mute`, implying \"That specific house (the one belonging to many small people), *that one*, is near me.\" This is distinct from `tomo pi jan lili a mute li lon poka mi`, which would mean \"The house of surprisingly many small people is near me\" (emphasizing 'mute'), or `tomo a pi jan lili mute li lon poka mi`, which might emphasize \"The house, yes, (that is) of many small people...\". Placing `a` directly after the full subject NP seems the most consistent way to mark the whole phrase for emphasis.\n\nSo, a working hypothesis could be: the particle `a`, when placed immediately after the final word of the subject noun phrase and before `li`, signals emphasis or focus on that entire subject phrase.\n\nLet's work on those test cases! It would be helpful to see minimal pairs that show:\n\n1.  A simple sentence without `a`.\n2.  The same sentence with `a` after a single-word subject.\n3.  A sentence with a modifier (e.g., `jan lili`).\n4.  The same sentence with `a` after the modified subject (`jan lili a li...`).\n5.  A sentence with a `pi` phrase.\n6.  The same sentence with `a` after the `pi` phrase subject.\n\nAlso, let's consider what happens if the subject is `mi` or `sina`, which typically omit `li`. Would the structure be `mi a predicate` or `mi a li predicate`? Given our proposed rule `[Subject] + a + li + [Predicate]`, it implies `li` *is* used when `a` is present, regardless of `mi` or `sina`. This would be a key clarification in the grammar: the presence of emphatic `a` triggers the use of `li` even after `mi` and `sina`. This might actually be a positive outcome – it adds another syntactic signal that `a` here is functioning specifically as an emphasis marker, distinct from its interjective use.\n\n`mi a li moku.` (I *do* eat.)\n`sina a li pona.` (You *are* good.)\n\nThis feels consistent. What are your thoughts on `mi a li` and `sina a li` as the structure?\n\nLet's plan those test cases focusing on `[Complete Subject NP] a li [Predicate]` as the proposed structure. We can then discuss the interpretations. Ready when you are!",

    "text": "The current specification is for: grammar. Here is the current specification:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\npenny: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona grammar. You go first.\ntails: pona! Let's start by looking at sentence structure. Toki Pona uses a simple Subject-Verb-Object order, with particles like li and e marking predicates and objects.\n\nOne thing I find intriguing is how the particle **li** separates subject from predicate except when the subject is mi or sina — then it's omitted. This creates a subtle distinction between personal pronouns and others in syntax without changing word forms.\n\nWhat if we consider generalizing this omission rule? For example, could it make sense to omit **li** not only after mi and sina but also for other frequent or \"close\" referents such as ona (\"they\") or jan (\"person\")? That might reduce particle use further while keeping clarity through context.\n\nOr maybe there’s room to allow optional omission of **li**, depending on speech register — more formal retains li; casual drops it often?\n\nThis would affect parsing but could add expressive flexibility. What do you think about experimenting with these kinds of syntactic variations? I'd be happy to hear your thoughts before taking next steps.\npenny: That's an interesting thought, considering extending the `li` omission beyond `mi` and `sina`. I see the appeal in reducing particle use and perhaps streamlining sentences. However, I do have some reservations about generalizing that rule to other subjects like `ona` or `jan`.\n\nThe current grammar's explicit `li` for subjects other than `mi` and `sina` provides a clear marker for the start of the predicate. Dropping `li` after `ona` could introduce ambiguity. For instance, `ona jan pona` could be interpreted as \"They are good people\" (ona [li] jan pona) or \"That good person\" (ona jan pona - where `jan pona` modifies `ona`). With the current grammar, `ona li jan pona` is clearly \"They are good people,\" and `jan pona ona` or `ona jan pona` could be used for \"that good person.\" Removing the mandatory `li` for `ona` would blur this distinction, potentially requiring more complex parsing or relying even more heavily on often fleeting context.\n\nExtending it to `jan` feels even riskier. `jan pona li tawa` means \"The good person goes,\" but `jan pona tawa` could be \"the traveling good person.\" Without `li` here, we lose that clear separation between subject and predicate.\n\nAs for an optional omission based on register, while that might seem to add flexibility, it could also lead to inconsistencies and difficulty for learners (be they human, AI, or otherwise). Toki Pona's strength lies in its simplicity and relative consistency. Introducing optional grammar rules might work against that core principle. How would an extra-sensory learner perceive the difference between formal and casual speech in the absence of explicit markers? The current strict rule, though requiring an extra particle sometimes, ensures a predictable structure.\n\nPerhaps instead of broadening the *omission* rule, we could explore other avenues for expressing nuanced subject-predicate relationships if that's the goal. For example, could the position or repetition of words after the subject signal different semantic roles in certain contexts, without needing to remove `li` entirely?\n\nI'm keen to hear your further thoughts on this. What specific kind of expressive flexibility were you imagining that dropping `li` might enable? Are there other ways we could achieve similar effects while maintaining or enhancing clarity?\ntails: I appreciate your careful analysis, and you’re right—clarity is paramount in Toki Pona’s minimal grammar. The examples you gave highlight how **li** acts as a crucial parsing anchor.\n\nYou raise an important point about ambiguity with subjects like *ona* or modifiers following them. Without *li*, the distinction between predicate and modifier phrases blurs considerably, which conflicts with Toki Pona's design goals of simplicity through unambiguous structure.\n\nWhat I had in mind by extending omission was mainly to allow more fluidity in rapid speech or poetic/literary registers where redundancy might be tolerable for rhythm or style — perhaps even optional ellipsis when context makes meaning unmistakable. But this may come at too high a cost if we lose structural clarity that learners rely on so heavily.\n\nYour suggestion about using word order or repetition to express nuances without removing **li** could be interesting territory instead. For example, what if intensification or focus on the subject were indicated by repeating it before the predicate? Something like:\n\n`jan li jan li pona.`\n\nHere, repeating `jan li` could emphasize “The person (indeed) is good,” akin to an emphatic \"It’s really a person who is good.\"\n\nAlternatively, what about introducing minimal particles purely for marking emphasis/focus around subjects?\n\nAnother idea worth exploring: since preverbs modify verbs directly before them (`mi wile moku`) but no similar system exists yet for emphasizing nouns/subjects syntactically beyond modifiers after heads — maybe we can develop such syntax markers without disturbing existing particle rules?\n\nThis would preserve grammatical consistency while expanding expressive precision.\n\nWould developing these kinds of subtle pragmatic particles make sense? Or should we consider other mechanisms within current constraints? I'm open to pushing boundaries carefully here; your insights help keep us grounded!\npenny: Those are compelling ideas, exploring ways to add nuance while respecting the existing grammatical framework. I particularly like the idea of exploring emphasis or focus on the subject. Simply repeating `li` as in `jan li jan li pona` feels a bit unnatural and clashes with the core SVO + `li` structure. `li` functions as the separator *before* the predicate, not as a part of the predicate itself that can be repeated in this way.\n\nHowever, focusing on particles or word order for emphasis seems more in line with Toki Pona's isolating nature.\n\nLet's consider your idea of dedicated particles for emphasis. What would such a particle look like? Perhaps something like `a` being used in a different position? We see `a` at the end for interjections (`pona a!`). Could it be placed immediately after the subject to highlight it?\n\n`jan a li pona.` - This person, *they* are good.\n\nThis feels plausible. It leverages an existing particle in a new syntactic slot to convey a pragmatic meaning (emphasis) without altering the core SVO structure. It would need careful consideration to ensure it doesn't interfere with other uses of `a`, but it feels less disruptive than changing the core `li` rule.\n\nAnother approach, staying within word order, could be a structure that signals \"as for X, Y\". Toki Pona already has `la` for context, which often serves a similar function to \"as for\".\n\n`jan la ona li pona.` - As for the person, they are good.\n\nThis is already a valid construction and achieves a type of focus on the subject `jan` by setting it up as the context for the following statement about `ona` (which refers back to `jan`). Perhaps this existing structure is sufficient for expressing focus on the subject?\n\nDeveloping \"minimal particles\" solely for emphasis feels like a significant addition to the grammar, potentially increasing the word count and complexity if not done thoughtfully. If we introduce a new particle, what would its precise function and placement be?\n\nThinking about emphasizing nouns/subjects syntactically *without* modifiers – this is interesting. Modifiers add descriptive information. What you're suggesting is adding a layer of *speaker attitude* or *stance* towards the subject. `a` after the subject seems to capture this quite well – it's already an interjection, conveying emotion or emphasis.\n\nHow about we focus on exploring the possibilities of using `a` after the subject for emphasis? It's a single character, already in the lexicon, and its interjective nature fits the idea of highlighting or drawing attention to the subject. We could propose this as an experimental grammatical feature: `subject a li predicate`. This could potentially be used with `mi`, `sina`, `ona`, `jan`, or any other subject noun phrase.\n\n`mi a li wile moku.` - *I* really want to eat.\n`telo a li pona tawa mi.` - Water, *that's* good for me.\n\nThis feels like a natural extension of `a`'s current function. What do you think, is exploring `subject a li predicate` a productive direction to take?\ntails: I think you're onto something very promising with using **a** after the subject to mark emphasis or focus. It respects Toki Pona's minimalist spirit by repurposing an existing particle rather than inventing a new one, and it fits semantically since **a** already conveys emotion or attention in interjections.\n\nYour examples like `mi a li wile moku.` have a natural feel — the speaker is flagging \"I\" as especially important or emotionally salient in that statement. Similarly, `telo a li pona tawa mi.` highlights water as significant here.\n\nThis could open up subtle pragmatic layers without breaking core syntax rules:\n\n- The formula would be: `[Subject] + a + li + [Predicate]`\n- It's optional and adds expressive nuance (emphasis/focus).\n- It can apply across all subjects (`mi`, `sina`, `jan Sonja`, etc.).\n- Since **a** currently appears mainly at phrase ends for exclamations, this medial position would need clear recognition but avoids collisions because it's always between subject and predicate.\n  \nIt also complements the existing use of **la**, which sets context broadly before sentences; whereas **a** post-subject zooms directly on that noun phrase’s salience within the sentence itself.\n\nOne thing to consider carefully is interaction with vocative/imperative uses of *o* following subjects (e.g., `jan Pape o!`) — we wouldn’t want confusion there if both appear mid-sentence. But since vocatives tend to stand alone or begin imperative clauses, mixing them seems unlikely.\n\nHow about limitations? Could we allow multiple emphatic particles? For instance:\n\n`jan Sonja a mi a li moku.`\n\nMeaning roughly: “Sonja – yes! And I too – really – eat.” This feels clunky though; maybe restrict one per clause?\n\nAlso interesting might be combining emphasis markers with modifiers:\n\n`jan suli a li pona.` - The big person (especially) is good.\n\nOr even applying it after complex noun phrases involving pi groups:\n\n`tomo pi jan lili mute a li lon poka mi.` - The house of many small people (!) is near me.\n\nAnother curiosity: does placing *a* only immediately after simple nouns work best? Or anywhere inside NP boundaries?\n\nThese are details worth testing through example sentences—both minimal pairs contrasting normal vs emphasized meaning—and seeing how listeners/readers interpret them naturally when parsing ambiguity exists elsewhere.\n\nShall I prepare some test cases illustrating these variants so we can explore their practical effects together? Also happy to brainstorm further applications like contrastive negation (“subject *really not* predicate”) if you find this avenue fruitful!\n\nWhat do you think about moving forward focusing on formalizing usage patterns for post-subject *a*, including constraints and interactions with other particles/modifiers?\npenny: Yes, let's absolutely focus on exploring the possibilities of `subject a li predicate`. I think it's a promising direction. Your point about repurposing `a` is excellent – it's efficient and leverages an existing semantic quality of the particle. The potential clarity gained from its distinct position between subject and `li` is a significant advantage.\n\nYou're right to raise the interaction with `o`. However, as you noted, `o` typically signals a direct address or a wish/command for the subject. `jan Pape o!` is a vocative address. `jan Pape o pali` is a command/wish directed at Pape. The proposed `jan Pape a li pona` describes a quality of Pape, not addressing them directly or commanding them. The contexts feel distinct enough that confusion is unlikely.\n\nRegarding limitations and multiple `a`s, I agree that `jan Sonja a mi a li moku` feels overly complex and deviates from Toki Pona's general economy of expression. I think restricting it to one `a` particle immediately following the entire subject noun phrase is the most logical and least confusing approach. Allowing multiple `a`s could quickly lead to syntactic bloat and ambiguity about *which* part of a compound subject is being emphasized. So, my initial thought is `[Complete Subject NP] a li [Predicate]`.\n\nLet's test that with your example:\n\n`tomo pi jan lili mute a li lon poka mi.`\n\nThis construction, with `a` immediately after `mute`, seems natural. It emphasizes the *entire* phrase `tomo pi jan lili mute`, implying \"That specific house (the one belonging to many small people), *that one*, is near me.\" This is distinct from `tomo pi jan lili a mute li lon poka mi`, which would mean \"The house of surprisingly many small people is near me\" (emphasizing 'mute'), or `tomo a pi jan lili mute li lon poka mi`, which might emphasize \"The house, yes, (that is) of many small people...\". Placing `a` directly after the full subject NP seems the most consistent way to mark the whole phrase for emphasis.\n\nSo, a working hypothesis could be: the particle `a`, when placed immediately after the final word of the subject noun phrase and before `li`, signals emphasis or focus on that entire subject phrase.\n\nLet's work on those test cases! It would be helpful to see minimal pairs that show:\n\n1.  A simple sentence without `a`.\n2.  The same sentence with `a` after a single-word subject.\n3.  A sentence with a modifier (e.g., `jan lili`).\n4.  The same sentence with `a` after the modified subject (`jan lili a li...`).\n5.  A sentence with a `pi` phrase.\n6.  The same sentence with `a` after the `pi` phrase subject.\n\nAlso, let's consider what happens if the subject is `mi` or `sina`, which typically omit `li`. Would the structure be `mi a predicate` or `mi a li predicate`? Given our proposed rule `[Subject] + a + li + [Predicate]`, it implies `li` *is* used when `a` is present, regardless of `mi` or `sina`.

The first word is the head, and subsequent words modify it.\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**, placed immediately after the word or phrase being negated.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking. (Here 'ala' modifies 'jan', meaning \"no person\").\n- `ona li pona ala.` - They are not good. (Here 'ala' modifies 'pona').\n\nWith multiple modifiers following a head noun, they all typically modify the head noun directly.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (two documents that are plants)\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box (a box that is both blue and black)\n\nTo clarify modifier groupings and indicate that modifiers form a phrase that collectively modifies the head, use **pi** after the head word. The subsequent words form a single modifier phrase.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document *of* two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (a box of the color \"dark blue\")\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases, typically introduced by words like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa**, follow the main predicate of the sentence.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using a tool (cutlery).\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the market.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nVarious methods exist for joining elements.\n\nUse **en** to join multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates for a single subject, repeat the **li** particle.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the **e** particle.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases of the same type modifying the same element, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house using sticks and using stones.\n\nUse **anu** to connect alternatives (\"or\").\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the market.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives following the noun they identify.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja-person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology rules.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nWhen placed before a verb, **o** forms a command or strong suggestion addressed to the listener.\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please. / You should work.\n\nWhen placed after a subject, **o** functions as a vocative particle, directly addressing that subject.\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\nWhen placed between the subject (including `mi` or `sina`) and the predicate, **o** expresses a wish, request, or suggestion regarding the subject.\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish goodness upon you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should work. / I want myself to work.\n\n**o** can sometimes contract the vocative and imperative uses when addressing a subject directly to issue a command.\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Ton the animal, eat. (Combines addressing Ton with the command to eat).\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words or phrases can stand alone or be followed by the particle **a** for added emphasis or emotion.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions, use the **verb ala verb** structure immediately after the subject and `li`.\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- `ona li lape ala lape?` - Are they sleeping?\n\nTo answer a yes/no question:\n- To affirm, repeat the verb: `moku.` (Yes, I am eating.)\n- To negate, say the verb followed by `ala`, or just `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` (No, I am not eating.)\n\nFor open-ended questions, **seme** is used to replace the element being asked about (subject, object, predicate, etc.).\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – What person is talking? / Who’s talking? (Seme replaces the subject)\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making? (Seme replaces the object)\n- `ona li lon seme?` - Where are they? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component - 'seme' here functions similarly to a noun meaning 'what place/thing')\n- `ni li seme?` - What is this? (Seme replaces the predicate)\n- `sina moku kepeken seme?` - What are you eating with? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component)\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic punctuation mark and does not grammatically mark a question in Toki Pona. Grammar (verb ala verb, seme) fulfills this function. Sentence boundaries are typically marked by periods (.) or equivalent pauses in speech.\n\nAnother way to ask an open-ended question is using **anu seme** at the end of a statement, meaning \"or what?\".\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating, or what? (Similar to a yes/no question but can invite a more open response)\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what?\n\n## Preverbs\n\nCertain words function as preverbs when placed immediately before the main verb after **li**. They modify the meaning of the following verb, often indicating modality or aspect.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (to want, to need), **kama** (to become, to manage to, to arrive), **sona** (to know how to), **lukin** (to try to, to look at), **ken** (can, able to), **awen** (to continue to, to remain), **alasa** (to try to find, to hunt).\n\nPreverbs can chain together:\n- `mi wile kama sona.` - I want to learn.\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** marks a preceding phrase or clause as the context for the main sentence that follows. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y is true.\" This can indicate time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Time/Condition context)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep. (Time context)\n- `telo li suli la telo li tawa anpa.` - Because water is big (abundant/powerful), it goes down. (Cause context)\n- `ijo ni la sina wile toki e seme?` - Regarding this thing, what do you want to say? (Topic context)\n\nMany prepositional phrases can be moved before **la** to function as context.\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can be rephrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` (For what reason are you hot?)\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a limited set of words for counting, which can be combined additively.\n\nAdditive system:\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nNumbers are formed by listing the units from largest to smallest.\n- `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n- `mute mute luka tu` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 2 = 47\n\nNumbers function as adjectives following the noun they quantify.\n- `jan tu` - two people\n\nOrdinals are formed using **nanpa** before the number or numerical phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd Street.\n\n## Subject Emphasis with **a** (Experimental)\n\nThe particle **a**, typically used for interjections, can optionally be placed immediately after the final word of the subject noun phrase and before **li** (even after `mi` or `sina`, triggering the use of `li` if normally omitted) to add emphasis or focus to the entire subject phrase.\n\n- `jan a li pona.` - *The person* is good. (Emphasizing 'jan')\n- `mi a li moku.` - *I* am eating. (Emphasizing 'mi')\n- `jan lili a li musi.` - *The child* is playing. (Emphasizing 'jan lili')\n- `tomo pi jan suli mute a li lon ma pona.` - *The house of many big people* is in the good land. (Emphasizing the whole NP)\n\nThis usage of `a` signals the speaker's highlighting or drawing attention to the subject as particularly salient in the sentence. It is distinct from other uses of `a` and is not compatible with the vocative/wish particle `o` in the subject phrase. Only one such emphatic `a` particle is typically used per clause.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions follow the elements they modify. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the subject is **mi** or **sina**.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no direct equivalent to the verb \"to be.\" The part after \"li\" (the predicate) describes the subject and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. / The fruit is edible.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity and Flexibility\n\nToki Pona words are general and possess broad meanings. One-to-one translation with languages like English is not always straightforward.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is derived from context)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can function as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash / apply water (verb)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb modifying a preceding verb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb in that clause.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You enlarge it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe. The first word is the head, and subsequent words modify it.\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**, placed immediately after the word or phrase being negated.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking. (Here 'ala' modifies 'jan', meaning \"no person\").\n- `ona li pona ala.` - They are not good. (Here 'ala' modifies 'pona').\n\nWith multiple modifiers following a head noun, they all typically modify the head noun directly.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (two documents that are plants)\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box (a box that is both blue and black)\n\nTo clarify modifier groupings and indicate that modifiers form a phrase that collectively modifies the head, use **pi** after the head word. The subsequent words form a single modifier phrase.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document *of* two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (a box of the color \"dark blue\")\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases, typically introduced by words like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa**, follow the main predicate of the sentence.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using a tool (cutlery).\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the market.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nVarious methods exist for joining elements.\n\nUse **en** to join multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates for a single subject, repeat the **li** particle.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the **e** particle.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases of the same type modifying the same element, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house using sticks and using stones.\n\nUse **anu** to connect alternatives (\"or\").\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the market.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives following the noun they identify.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja-person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology rules.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nWhen placed before a verb, **o** forms a command or strong suggestion addressed to the listener.\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please. / You should work.\n\nWhen placed after a subject, **o** functions as a vocative particle, directly addressing that subject.\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\nWhen placed between the subject (including `mi` or `sina`) and the predicate, **o** expresses a wish, request, or suggestion regarding the subject.\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish goodness upon you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should work. / I want myself to work.\n\n**o** can sometimes contract the vocative and imperative uses when addressing a subject directly to issue a command.\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Ton the animal, eat. (Combines addressing Ton with the command to eat).\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words or phrases can stand alone or be followed by the particle **a** for added emphasis or emotion.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions, use the **verb ala verb** structure immediately after the subject and `li`.\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- `ona li lape ala lape?` - Are they sleeping?\n\nTo answer a yes/no question:\n- To affirm, repeat the verb: `moku.` (Yes, I am eating.)\n- To negate, say the verb followed by `ala`, or just `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` (No, I am not eating.)\n\nFor open-ended questions, **seme** is used to replace the element being asked about (subject, object, predicate, etc.).\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – What person is talking? / Who’s talking? (Seme replaces the subject)\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making? (Seme replaces the object)\n- `ona li lon seme?` - Where are they? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component - 'seme' here functions similarly to a noun meaning 'what place/thing')\n- `ni li seme?` - What is this? (Seme replaces the predicate)\n- `sina moku kepeken seme?` - What are you eating with? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component)\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic punctuation mark and does not grammatically mark a question in Toki Pona. Grammar (verb ala verb, seme) fulfills this function. Sentence boundaries are typically marked by periods (.) or equivalent pauses in speech.\n\nAnother way to ask an open-ended question is using **anu seme** at the end of a statement, meaning \"or what?\".\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating, or what? (Similar to a yes/no question but can invite a more open response)\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what?\n\n## Preverbs\n\nCertain words function as preverbs when placed immediately before the main verb after **li**. They modify the meaning of the following verb, often indicating modality or aspect.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (to want, to need), **kama** (to become, to manage to, to arrive), **sona** (to know how to), **lukin** (to try to, to look at), **ken** (can, able to), **awen** (to continue to, to remain), **alasa** (to try to find, to hunt).\n\nPreverbs can chain together:\n- `mi wile kama sona.` - I want to learn.\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** marks a preceding phrase or clause as the context for the main sentence that follows. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y is true.\" This can indicate time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Time/Condition context)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep. (Time context)\n- `telo li suli la telo li tawa anpa.` - Because water is big (abundant/powerful), it goes down. (Cause context)\n- `ijo ni la sina wile toki e seme?` - Regarding this thing, what do you want to say? (Topic context)\n\nMany prepositional phrases can be moved before **la** to function as context.\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can be rephrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` (For what reason are you hot?)\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a limited set of words for counting, which can be combined additively.\n\nAdditive system:\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nNumbers are formed by listing the units from largest to smallest.\n- `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n- `mute mute luka tu` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 2 = 47\n\nNumbers function as adjectives following the noun they quantify.\n- `jan tu` - two people\n\nOrdinals are formed using **nanpa** before the number or numerical phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd Street.\n\n## Subject Emphasis with **a** (Experimental)\n\nThe particle **a**, typically used for interjections, can optionally be placed immediately after the final word of the subject noun phrase and before **li** (even after `mi` or `sina`, triggering the use of `li` if normally omitted) to add emphasis or focus to the entire subject phrase.\n\n- `jan a li pona.` - *The person* is good. (Emphasizing 'jan')\n- `mi a li moku.` - *I* am eating. (Emphasizing 'mi')\n- `jan lili a li musi.` - *The child* is playing. (Emphasizing 'jan lili')\n- `tomo pi jan suli mute a li lon ma pona.` - *The house of many big people* is in the good land. (Emphasizing the whole NP)\n\nThis usage of `a` signals the speaker's highlighting or drawing attention to the subject as particularly salient in the sentence. It is distinct from other uses of `a` and is not compatible with the vocative/wish particle `o` in the subject phrase. Only one such emphatic `a` particle is typically used per clause.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\nToki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure, where (C) is an optional consonant, V is a vowel, and (n) is an optional final 'n'.\n\n- No vowel clusters are allowed.\n- No consonant clusters are allowed within a syllable or across syllable boundaries.\n\n## Disallowed Sequences\n\nThe following sequences are not permitted: wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn.\n\n- **ji, ti:** These sequences are phonotactically disfavored in many languages, as the palatal approximant /j/ does not combine smoothly with the alveolar stop /t/ or the palato-alveolar affricate /dʒ/ (often represented by 'j' in English). The restriction simplifies pronunciation.\n- **wu, wo:** These sequences involving the labial-velar approximant /w/ before the vowels /u/ and /o/ can lead to unclear transitions or potential complexity, disrupting the intended clear (C)V syllable structure.\n- **nm, nn:** These sequences involving the nasal consonant /n/ are restricted to maintain clear syllabic boundaries and simplify nasal transitions.\n\n## Consonant Sounds\n\nToki Pona consonants are generally pronounced similarly to their typical realizations in English, with the exception of 'j'. These descriptions and IPA symbols serve as reference points, allowing for minor allophonic variation as long as clarity is maintained.\n\n- **p:** /p/ (voiceless bilabial stop, typically unaspirated, like the 'p' in \"spin\")\n- **t:** /t/ (voiceless alveolar stop, typically unaspirated, like the 't' in \"stop\")\n- **k:** /k/ (voiceless velar stop, typically unaspirated, like the 'k' in \"skate\")\n- **s:** /s/ (voiceless alveolar fricative, like the 's' in \"sun\")\n- **m:** /m/ (voiced bilabial nasal, like the 'm' in \"man\")\n- **n:** /n/ (voiced alveolar nasal, like the 'n' in \"no\")\n- **l:** /l/ (voiced alveolar lateral approximant, typically a \"clear\" or non-velarized 'l', like the 'l' in \"light\")\n- **w:** /w/ (voiced labial-velar approximant, like the 'w' in \"wet\")\n- **j:** /j/ (voiced palatal approximant, like the 'y' in \"yes\")\n\n## Vowel Sounds\n\nToki Pona vowels are pronounced similarly to the pure, clear vowels of Spanish. These descriptions and IPA symbols serve as reference points, aiming for distinct vowel sounds without diphthongization.\n\n- **a:** /a/ (like the 'a' in \"father\")\n- **e:** /e/ (like the 'e' in \"hey,\" but without a strong diphthongal off-glide)\n- **i:** /i/ (like the 'i' in \"machine\")\n- **o:** /o/ (like the 'o' in \"go,\" but without a strong diphthongal off-glide)\n- **u:** /u/ (like the 'u' in \"boot\")\n\n## Prosody\n\nWhile not strictly defined, a relatively neutral or flat intonation is typical, with meaning primarily conveyed through sentence structure and particles rather than significant pitch changes for emphasis.\n\n## Note on Variation\n\nMinor phonetic differences are acceptable. The primary goal of Toki Pona phonetics is intelligibility and ease of pronunciation across diverse linguistic backgrounds.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nsin:new, fresh, another\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nnanpa:number marker\nwile:need, want, must\nesun:market, shop, fair\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\npini:finished, past\nkala:sea creature\npana:to give, send\nmije:male\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nweka:absent, away\nkon:air, spirit, essence\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nmama:parent, caretaker\npoki:container, box, cup\nsuno:sun, light source\npakala:broken, to mess up\ntoki:language, speech\nko:clay, paste, powder\npi:regroups modifiers\nsijelo:body, physical state\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nkule:color, colorful\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nnoka:foot, leg\ntaso:but, only\ntu:two\nolin:love, respect\nni:this, that\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nmonsi:back, behind\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nona:third-person pronoun\nmu:animal sound\ntomo:indoor space, house\nkepeken:to use, with\nloje:red\njo:to have, contain, hold\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nlon:located at, true\nuta:mouth, lips\nma:land, outdoors\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nsewi:above, divine\nlupa:door, hole\nsoko:mushroom\no:vocative/imperative\njan:person, somebody\ntawa:to, moving, for\ntelo:water, liquid\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nken:can, able, possible\nsama:same, similar\nlaso:blue, green\nselo:skin, outer layer\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nen:multiple subject marker\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nutala:fight, challenge\nsupa:flat surface, table\nseme:what, which\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nnamako:spice, additional\nleko:square, block\ne:direct object marker\nilo:tool, machine, device\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nmeli:female\ntan:from, because\npoka:side, nearby\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nsona:knowledge, to know\npilin:heart, feeling\nlen:cloth, cover\nluka:hand, arm; five\nwawa:strong, energetic\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nmute:many, a lot, very\nala:no, not, zero\nwan:one, unique\nkulupu:group, community\njaki:disgusting, unclean\npona:good, positive, simple\nunpa:sex\nkin:also, too\nkili:fruit, vegetable\npali:to do, to work\nnasin:way, road, method\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nlukin:to see, examine\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nsoweli:land animal\nmoli:dead, dying\npipi:insect\nla:context marker\nmi:I, me, we\nsuli:big, large\npimeja:black, dark\nwalo:white, light-colored\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nseli:fire, heat source\nlete:cold, raw\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nkute:ear, to hear\nnimi:word, name\nante:different, other, changed\nli:predicate marker\njelo:yellow\nmun:moon, night sky object\nopen:to begin, opening\nmani:money, currency\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nlape:sleeping, resting\nnasa:strange, foolish\nlili:small, little, few\nsina:you\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\ntenpo:time, period\nDo not discuss the structure of the dictionary. Rather, discuss the words and enhancements that may need to be made to them.\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions follow the elements they modify. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the subject is **mi** or **sina**.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no direct equivalent to the verb \"to be.\" The part after \"li\" (the predicate) describes the subject and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. / The fruit is edible.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity and Flexibility\n\nToki Pona words are general and possess broad meanings. One-to-one translation with languages like English is not always straightforward.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is derived from context)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can function as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash / apply water (verb)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb modifying a preceding verb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb in that clause.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You enlarge it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe. The first word is the head, and subsequent words modify it.\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**, placed immediately after the word or phrase being negated.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking. (Here 'ala' modifies 'jan', meaning \"no person\").\n- `ona li pona ala.` - They are not good. (Here 'ala' modifies 'pona').\n\nWith multiple modifiers following a head noun, they all typically modify the head noun directly.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (two documents that are plants)\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box (a box that is both blue and black)\n\nTo clarify modifier groupings and indicate that modifiers form a phrase that collectively modifies the head, use **pi** after the head word. The subsequent words form a single modifier phrase.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document *of* two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (a box of the color \"dark blue\")\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases, typically introduced by words like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa**, follow the main predicate of the sentence.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using a tool (cutlery).\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the market.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nVarious methods exist for joining elements.\n\nUse **en** to join multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates for a single subject, repeat the **li** particle.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the **e** particle.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases of the same type modifying the same element, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house using sticks and using stones.\n\nUse **anu** to connect alternatives (\"or\").\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the market.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives following the noun they identify.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja-person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology rules.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nWhen placed before a verb, **o** forms a command or strong suggestion addressed to the listener.\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please. / You should work.\n\nWhen placed after a subject, **o** functions as a vocative particle, directly addressing that subject.\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\nWhen placed between the subject (including `mi` or `sina`) and the predicate, **o** expresses a wish, request, or suggestion regarding the subject.\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish goodness upon you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should work. / I want myself to work.\n\n**o** can sometimes contract the vocative and imperative uses when addressing a subject directly to issue a command.\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Ton the animal, eat. (Combines addressing Ton with the command to eat).\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words or phrases can stand alone or be followed by the particle **a** for added emphasis or emotion.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions, use the **verb ala verb** structure immediately after the subject and `li`.\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- `ona li lape ala lape?` - Are they sleeping?\n\nTo answer a yes/no question:\n- To affirm, repeat the verb: `moku.` (Yes, I am eating.)\n- To negate, say the verb followed by `ala`, or just `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` (No, I am not eating.)\n\nFor open-ended questions, **seme** is used to replace the element being asked about (subject, object, predicate, etc.).\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – What person is talking? / Who’s talking? (Seme replaces the subject)\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making? (Seme replaces the object)\n- `ona li lon seme?` - Where are they? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component - 'seme' here functions similarly to a noun meaning 'what place/thing')\n- `ni li seme?` - What is this? (Seme replaces the predicate)\n- `sina moku kepeken seme?` - What are you eating with? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component)\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic punctuation mark and does not grammatically mark a question in Toki Pona. Grammar (verb ala verb, seme) fulfills this function. Sentence boundaries are typically marked by periods (.) or equivalent pauses in speech.\n\nAnother way to ask an open-ended question is using **anu seme** at the end of a statement, meaning \"or what?\".\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating, or what? (Similar to a yes/no question but can invite a more open response)\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what?\n\n## Preverbs\n\nCertain words function as preverbs when placed immediately before the main verb after **li**. They modify the meaning of the following verb, often indicating modality or aspect.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (to want, to need), **kama** (to become, to manage to, to arrive), **sona** (to know how to), **lukin** (to try to, to look at), **ken** (can, able to), **awen** (to continue to, to remain), **alasa** (to try to find, to hunt).\n\nPreverbs can chain together:\n- `mi wile kama sona.` - I want to learn.\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** marks a preceding phrase or clause as the context for the main sentence that follows. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y is true.\" This can indicate time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Time/Condition context)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep. (Time context)\n- `telo li suli la telo li tawa anpa.` - Because water is big (abundant/powerful), it goes down. (Cause context)\n- `ijo ni la sina wile toki e seme?` - Regarding this thing, what do you want to say? (Topic context)\n\nMany prepositional phrases can be moved before **la** to function as context.\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can be rephrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` (For what reason are you hot?)\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a limited set of words for counting, which can be combined additively.\n\nAdditive system:\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nNumbers are formed by listing the units from largest to smallest.\n- `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n- `mute mute luka tu` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 2 = 47\n\nNumbers function as adjectives following the noun they quantify.\n- `jan tu` - two people\n\nOrdinals are formed using **nanpa** before the number or numerical phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd Street.\n\n## Subject Emphasis with **a** (Experimental)\n\nThe particle **a**, typically used for interjections, can optionally be placed immediately after the final word of the subject noun phrase and before **li** (even after `mi` or `sina`, triggering the use of `li` if normally omitted) to add emphasis or focus to the entire subject phrase.\n\n- `jan a li pona.` - *The person* is good. (Emphasizing 'jan')\n- `mi a li moku.` - *I* am eating. (Emphasizing 'mi')\n- `jan lili a li musi.` - *The child* is playing. (Emphasizing 'jan lili')\n- `tomo pi jan suli mute a li lon ma pona.` - *The house of many big people* is in the good land. (Emphasizing the whole NP)\n\nThis usage of `a` signals the speaker's highlighting or drawing attention to the subject as particularly salient in the sentence. It is distinct from other uses of `a` and is not compatible with the vocative/wish particle `o` in the subject phrase. Only one such emphatic `a` particle is typically used per clause.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions follow the elements they modify. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the subject is **mi** or **sina**.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no direct equivalent to the verb \"to be.\" The part after \"li\" (the predicate) describes the subject and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. / The fruit is edible.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity and Flexibility\n\nToki Pona words are general and possess broad meanings. One-to-one translation with languages like English is not always straightforward.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is derived from context)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can function as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash / apply water (verb)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb modifying a preceding verb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb in that clause.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You enlarge it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe. The first word is the head, and subsequent words modify it.\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**, placed immediately after the word or phrase being negated.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking. (Here 'ala' modifies 'jan', meaning \"no person\").\n- `ona li pona ala.` - They are not good. (Here 'ala' modifies 'pona').\n\nWith multiple modifiers following a head noun, they all typically modify the head noun directly.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (two documents that are plants)\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box (a box that is both blue and black)\n\nTo clarify modifier groupings and indicate that modifiers form a phrase that collectively modifies the head, use **pi** after the head word. The subsequent words form a single modifier phrase.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document *of* two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (a box of the color \"dark blue\")\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases, typically introduced by words like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa**, follow the main predicate of the sentence.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using a tool (cutlery).\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the market.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nVarious methods exist for joining elements.\n\nUse **en** to join multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates for a single subject, repeat the **li** particle.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the **e** particle.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases of the same type modifying the same element, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house using sticks and using stones.\n\nUse **anu** to connect alternatives (\"or\").\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the market.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives following the noun they identify.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja-person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology rules.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nWhen placed before a verb, **o** forms a command or strong suggestion addressed to the listener.\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please. / You should work.\n\nWhen placed after a subject, **o** functions as a vocative particle, directly addressing that subject.\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\nWhen placed between the subject (including `mi` or `sina`) and the predicate, **o** expresses a wish, request, or suggestion regarding the subject.\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish goodness upon you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should work. / I want myself to work.\n\n**o** can sometimes contract the vocative and imperative uses when addressing a subject directly to issue a command.\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Ton the animal, eat. (Combines addressing Ton with the command to eat).\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words or phrases can stand alone or be followed by the particle **a** for added emphasis or emotion.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions, use the **verb ala verb** structure immediately after the subject and `li`.\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- `ona li lape ala lape?` - Are they sleeping?\n\nTo answer a yes/no question:\n- To affirm, repeat the verb: `moku.` (Yes, I am eating.)\n- To negate, say the verb followed by `ala`, or just `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` (No, I am not eating.)\n\nFor open-ended questions, **seme** is used to replace the element being asked about (subject, object, predicate, etc.).\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – What person is talking? / Who’s talking? (Seme replaces the subject)\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making? (Seme replaces the object)\n- `ona li lon seme?` - Where are they? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component - 'seme' here functions similarly to a noun meaning 'what place/thing')\n- `ni li seme?` - What is this? (Seme replaces the predicate)\n- `sina moku kepeken seme?` - What are you eating with? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component)\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic punctuation mark and does not grammatically mark a question in Toki Pona. Grammar (verb ala verb, seme) fulfills this function. Sentence boundaries are typically marked by periods (.) or equivalent pauses in speech.\n\nAnother way to ask an open-ended question is using **anu seme** at the end of a statement, meaning \"or what?\".\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating, or what? (Similar to a yes/no question but can invite a more open response)\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what?\n\n## Preverbs\n\nCertain words function as preverbs when placed immediately before the main verb after **li**. They modify the meaning of the following verb, often indicating modality or aspect.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (to want, to need), **kama** (to become, to manage to, to arrive), **sona** (to know how to), **lukin** (to try to, to look at), **ken** (can, able to), **awen** (to continue to, to remain), **alasa** (to try to find, to hunt).\n\nPreverbs can chain together:\n- `mi wile kama sona.` - I want to learn.\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** marks a preceding phrase or clause as the context for the main sentence that follows. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y is true.\" This can indicate time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Time/Condition context)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep. (Time context)\n- `telo li suli la telo li tawa anpa.` - Because water is big (abundant/powerful), it goes down. (Cause context)\n- `ijo ni la sina wile toki e seme?` - Regarding this thing, what do you want to say? (Topic context)\n\nMany prepositional phrases can be moved before **la** to function as context.\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can be rephrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` (For what reason are you hot?)\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a limited set of words for counting, which can be combined additively.\n\nAdditive system:\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nNumbers are formed by listing the units from largest to smallest.\n- `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n- `mute mute luka tu` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 2 = 47\n\nNumbers function as adjectives following the noun they quantify.\n- `jan tu` - two people\n\nOrdinals are formed using **nanpa** before the number or numerical phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd Street.\n\n## Subject Emphasis with **a** (Experimental)\n\nThe particle **a**, typically used for interjections, can optionally be placed immediately after the final word of the subject noun phrase and before **li** (even after `mi` or `sina`, triggering the use of `li` if normally omitted) to add emphasis or focus to the entire subject phrase.\n\n- `jan a li pona.` - *The person* is good. (Emphasizing 'jan')\n- `mi a li moku.` - *I* am eating. (Emphasizing 'mi')\n- `jan lili a li musi.` - *The child* is playing. (Emphasizing 'jan lili')\n- `tomo pi jan suli mute a li lon ma pona.` - *The house of many big people* is in the good land. (Emphasizing the whole NP)\n\nThis usage of `a` signals the speaker's highlighting or drawing attention to the subject as particularly salient in the sentence. It is distinct from other uses of `a` and is not compatible with the vocative/wish particle `o` in the subject phrase. Only one such emphatic `a` particle is typically used per clause.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\nToki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure, where (C) is an optional consonant, V is a vowel, and (n) is an optional final 'n'.\n\n- No vowel clusters are allowed.\n- No consonant clusters are allowed within a syllable or across syllable boundaries.\n\n## Disallowed Sequences\n\nThe following sequences are not permitted: wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn.\n\n- **ji, ti:** These sequences are phonotactically disfavored in many languages, as the palatal approximant /j/ does not combine smoothly with the alveolar stop /t/ or the palato-alveolar affricate /dʒ/ (often represented by 'j' in English). The restriction simplifies pronunciation.\n- **wu, wo:** These sequences involving the labial-velar approximant /w/ before the vowels /u/ and /o/ can lead to unclear transitions or potential complexity, disrupting the intended clear (C)V syllable structure.\n- **nm, nn:** These sequences involving the nasal consonant /n/ are restricted to maintain clear syllabic boundaries and simplify nasal transitions.\n\n## Consonant Sounds\n\nToki Pona consonants are generally pronounced similarly to their typical realizations in English, with the exception of 'j'. These descriptions and IPA symbols serve as reference points, allowing for minor allophonic variation as long as clarity is maintained.\n\n- **p:** /p/ (voiceless bilabial stop, typically unaspirated, like the 'p' in \"spin\")\n- **t:** /t/ (voiceless alveolar stop, typically unaspirated, like the 't' in \"stop\")\n- **k:** /k/ (voiceless velar stop, typically unaspirated, like the 'k' in \"skate\")\n- **s:** /s/ (voiceless alveolar fricative, like the 's' in \"sun\")\n- **m:** /m/ (voiced bilabial nasal, like the 'm' in \"man\")\n- **n:** /n/ (voiced alveolar nasal, like the 'n' in \"no\")\n- **l:** /l/ (voiced alveolar lateral approximant, typically a \"clear\" or non-velarized 'l', like the 'l' in \"light\")\n- **w:** /w/ (voiced labial-velar approximant, like the 'w' in \"wet\")\n- **j:** /j/ (voiced palatal approximant, like the 'y' in \"yes\")\n\n## Vowel Sounds\n\nToki Pona vowels are pronounced similarly to the pure, clear vowels of Spanish. These descriptions and IPA symbols serve as reference points, aiming for distinct vowel sounds without diphthongization.\n\n- **a:** /a/ (like the 'a' in \"father\")\n- **e:** /e/ (like the 'e' in \"hey,\" but without a strong diphthongal off-glide)\n- **i:** /i/ (like the 'i' in \"machine\")\n- **o:** /o/ (like the 'o' in \"go,\" but without a strong diphthongal off-glide)\n- **u:** /u/ (like the 'u' in \"boot\")\n\n## Prosody\n\nWhile not strictly defined, a relatively neutral or flat intonation is typical, with meaning primarily conveyed through sentence structure and particles rather than significant pitch changes for emphasis.\n\n## Note on Variation\n\nMinor phonetic differences are acceptable. The primary goal of Toki Pona phonetics is intelligibility and ease of pronunciation across diverse linguistic backgrounds.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nsin:new, fresh, another\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nnanpa:number marker\nwile:need, want, must\nesun:market, shop, fair\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\npini:finished, past\nkala:sea creature\npana:to give, send\nmije:male\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nweka:absent, away\nkon:air, spirit, essence\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nmama:parent, caretaker\npoki:container, box, cup\nsuno:sun, light source\npakala:broken, to mess up\ntoki:language, speech\nko:clay, paste, powder\npi:regroups modifiers\nsijelo:body, physical state\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nkule:color, colorful\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nnoka:foot, leg\ntaso:but, only\ntu:two\nolin:love, respect\nni:this, that\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nmonsi:back, behind\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nona:third-person pronoun\nmu:animal sound\ntomo:indoor space, house\nkepeken:to use, with\nloje:red\njo:to have, contain, hold\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nlon:located at, true\nuta:mouth, lips\nma:land, outdoors\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nsewi:above, divine\nlupa:door, hole\nsoko:mushroom\no:vocative/imperative\njan:person, somebody\ntawa:to, moving, for\ntelo:water, liquid\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nken:can, able, possible\nsama:same, similar\nlaso:blue, green\nselo:skin, outer layer\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nen:multiple subject marker\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nutala:fight, challenge\nsupa:flat surface, table\nseme:what, which\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nnamako:spice, additional\nleko:square, block\ne:direct object marker\nilo:tool, machine, device\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nmeli:female\ntan:from, because\npoka:side, nearby\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nsona:knowledge, to know\npilin:heart, feeling\nlen:cloth, cover\nluka:hand, arm; five\nwawa:strong, energetic\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nmute:many, a lot, very\nala:no, not, zero\nwan:one, unique\nkulupu:group, community\njaki:disgusting, unclean\npona:good, positive, simple\nunpa:sex\nkin:also, too\nkili:fruit, vegetable\npali:to do, to work\nnasin:way, road, method\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nlukin:to see, examine\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nsoweli:land animal\nmoli:dead, dying\npipi:insect\nla:context marker\nmi:I, me, we\nsuli:big, large\npimeja:black, dark\nwalo:white, light-colored\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nseli:fire, heat source\nlete:cold, raw\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nkute:ear, to hear\nnimi:word, name\nante:different, other, changed\nli:predicate marker\njelo:yellow\nmun:moon, night sky object\nopen:to begin, opening\nmani:money, currency\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nlape:sleeping, resting\nnasa:strange, foolish\nlili:small, little, few\nsina:you\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\ntenpo:time, period\nDo not discuss the structure of the dictionary. Rather, discuss the words and enhancements that may need to be made to them.\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions follow the elements they modify. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the subject is **mi** or **sina**.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no direct equivalent to the verb \"to be.\" The part after \"li\" (the predicate) describes the subject and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. / The fruit is edible.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity and Flexibility\n\nToki Pona words are general and possess broad meanings. One-to-one translation with languages like English is not always straightforward.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is derived from context)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can function as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash / apply water (verb)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb modifying a preceding verb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb in that clause.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You enlarge it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe. The first word is the head, and subsequent words modify it.\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**, placed immediately after the word or phrase being negated.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking. (Here 'ala' modifies 'jan', meaning \"no person\").\n- `ona li pona ala.` - They are not good. (Here 'ala' modifies 'pona').\n\nWith multiple modifiers following a head noun, they all typically modify the head noun directly.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (two documents that are plants)\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box (a box that is both blue and black)\n\nTo clarify modifier groupings and indicate that modifiers form a phrase that collectively modifies the head, use **pi** after the head word. The subsequent words form a single modifier phrase.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document *of* two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (a box of the color \"dark blue\")\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases, typically introduced by words like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa**, follow the main predicate of the sentence.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using a tool (cutlery).\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the market.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nVarious methods exist for joining elements.\n\nUse **en** to join multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates for a single subject, repeat the **li** particle.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the **e** particle.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases of the same type modifying the same element, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house using sticks and using stones.\n\nUse **anu** to connect alternatives (\"or\").\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the market.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives following the noun they identify.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja-person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology rules.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nWhen placed before a verb, **o** forms a command or strong suggestion addressed to the listener.\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please. / You should work.\n\nWhen placed after a subject, **o** functions as a vocative particle, directly addressing that subject.\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\nWhen placed between the subject (including `mi` or `sina`) and the predicate, **o** expresses a wish, request, or suggestion regarding the subject.\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish goodness upon you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should work. / I want myself to work.\n\n**o** can sometimes contract the vocative and imperative uses when addressing a subject directly to issue a command.\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Ton the animal, eat. (Combines addressing Ton with the command to eat).\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words or phrases can stand alone or be followed by the particle **a** for added emphasis or emotion.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions, use the **verb ala verb** structure immediately after the subject and `li`.\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- `ona li lape ala lape?` - Are they sleeping?\n\nTo answer a yes/no question:\n- To affirm, repeat the verb: `moku.` (Yes, I am eating.)\n- To negate, say the verb followed by `ala`, or just `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` (No, I am not eating.)\n\nFor open-ended questions, **seme** is used to replace the element being asked about (subject, object, predicate, etc.).\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – What person is talking? / Who’s talking? (Seme replaces the subject)\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making? (Seme replaces the object)\n- `ona li lon seme?` - Where are they? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component - 'seme' here functions similarly to a noun meaning 'what place/thing')\n- `ni li seme?` - What is this? (Seme replaces the predicate)\n- `sina moku kepeken seme?` - What are you eating with? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component)\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic punctuation mark and does not grammatically mark a question in Toki Pona. Grammar (verb ala verb, seme) fulfills this function. Sentence boundaries are typically marked by periods (.) or equivalent pauses in speech.\n\nAnother way to ask an open-ended question is using **anu seme** at the end of a statement, meaning \"or what?\".\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating, or what? (Similar to a yes/no question but can invite a more open response)\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what?\n\n## Preverbs\n\nCertain words function as preverbs when placed immediately before the main verb after **li**. They modify the meaning of the following verb, often indicating modality or aspect.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (to want, to need), **kama** (to become, to manage to, to arrive), **sona** (to know how to), **lukin** (to try to, to look at), **ken** (can, able to), **awen** (to continue to, to remain), **alasa** (to try to find, to hunt).\n\nPreverbs can chain together:\n- `mi wile kama sona.` - I want to learn.\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** marks a preceding phrase or clause as the context for the main sentence that follows. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y is true.\" This can indicate time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Time/Condition context)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep. (Time context)\n- `telo li suli la telo li tawa anpa.` - Because water is big (abundant/powerful), it goes down. (Cause context)\n- `ijo ni la sina wile toki e seme?` - Regarding this thing, what do you want to say? (Topic context)\n\nMany prepositional phrases can be moved before **la** to function as context.\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can be rephrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` (For what reason are you hot?)\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a limited set of words for counting, which can be combined additively.\n\nAdditive system:\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nNumbers are formed by listing the units from largest to smallest.\n- `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n- `mute mute luka tu` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 2 = 47\n\nNumbers function as adjectives following the noun they quantify.\n- `jan tu` - two people\n\nOrdinals are formed using **nanpa** before the number or numerical phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd Street.\n\n## Subject Emphasis with **a** (Experimental)\n\nThe particle **a**, typically used for interjections, can optionally be placed immediately after the final word of the subject noun phrase and before **li** (even after `mi` or `sina`, triggering the use of `li` if normally omitted) to add emphasis or focus to the entire subject phrase.\n\n- `jan a li pona.` - *The person* is good. (Emphasizing 'jan')\n- `mi a li moku.` - *I* am eating. (Emphasizing 'mi')\n- `jan lili a li musi.` - *The child* is playing. (Emphasizing 'jan lili')\n- `tomo pi jan suli mute a li lon ma pona.` - *The house of many big people* is in the good land. (Emphasizing the whole NP)\n\nThis usage of `a` signals the speaker's highlighting or drawing attention to the subject as particularly salient in the sentence. It is distinct from other uses of `a` and is not compatible with the vocative/wish particle `o` in the subject phrase. Only one such emphatic `a` particle is typically used per clause.",

What are your thoughts?",

    "text": "I agree that 'mani' is quite a flexible word in usage, often going beyond physical coins or bills. In practice, speakers use 'mani' for wealth more abstractly — like \"mani mi li suli\" can mean \"my money/wealth is large.\" So expanding the meaning to include general value, wealth, assets, or resources aligns well with natural Toki Pona semantic extension.\n\nHowever, since Toki Pona emphasizes simplicity and broad meanings by design, it might be best to state these extensions as part of the core sense rather than separate sub-meanings. For example: \n\n`**mani** – money; currency; wealth; resource`\n\nThis keeps it concise but signals broader application. We could even add a small grammar note about how context defines if it's literal currency or just valuable stuff.\n\nDo you think adding examples showing this flexibility would help learners grasp it better? Or does that risk complicating our minimalist dictionary? I'm curious what you feel about balancing precision against minimalism here. Also I'd like to hear your thoughts on any other words you'd want us to re-examine similarly!",

    "text": "I like that updated definition: \"**mani** – money; currency; wealth; resource\". It's still concise but definitely covers the usage better than just \"money, currency\". And yes, adding a note about how context determines the specific nuance is a good idea. Toki Pona thrives on that contextual interpretation. We wouldn't need examples in the dictionary itself, I think the note would be sufficient. Examples are probably better suited for a grammar or phrasebook, where we can demonstrate *how* the word's meaning shifts in different sentence structures. The dictionary should aim for a clear, albeit broad, core definition.\n\nLooking at other words, 'nasa' comes to mind. The current entry is \"strange, foolish\". This also feels a bit narrow. 'nasa' can describe anything outside the expected or ordinary – weird, unpredictable, silly, even intoxicating (like with *telo nasa* for alcohol). It's less about a moral judgment like \"foolish\" and more about deviation from the norm or perceived reality.\n\nPerhaps the definition for 'nasa' could be updated to something like:\n\n`**nasa** – strange, unusual, unpredictable, foolish, silly, intoxicated`\n\nOr maybe something shorter that encompasses the core idea of deviation from expectation? How about just \"unusual, strange\"? Does that feel sufficient to you? The term \"foolish\" seems to carry a negative connotation that isn't always present when 'nasa' is used. Sometimes things are just wonderfully weird!",

    "text": "That's a very insightful take on 'nasa'. I agree that “foolish” implies judgment which is not always inherent in 'nasa' — its core meaning leans more toward deviation from normality or expectation, whether neutral, positive, or negative. Your suggestion to emphasize \"unusual\" and \"strange\" captures the essence while leaving room for context.\n\nI think we should avoid an overly long list of nuances in the dictionary entry itself; instead aim for something compact but flexible. Perhaps:\n\n`**nasa** – unusual, strange, unpredictable`\n\nThis covers both neutral strangeness and unpredictability (which includes intoxication effects). We can omit “foolish” since it may confuse learners by implying negativity. If needed, users can combine modifiers like `ike nasa` (\"bad weird\") or clarify with other words.\n\nAlso worth noting: Toki Pona’s tendency to conflate related concepts into one word encourages relying on context heavily here.\n\nOn a side note regarding *telo nasa*, it's interesting how compounds provide clarity where single words remain broad. That interplay between general roots and compound specificity is quite elegant in Toki Pona's design.\n\nBefore moving onto another term—do you feel any other color-words need re-examining? For example ‘laso’ is defined as blue/green now; should we consider teasing apart those hues better? Or keep it deliberately ambiguous?",

And yes, you're right about compounds – they really help provide that specificity where the root word is intentionally broad.\n\nRegarding color words, that's a great question. 'laso' covering both blue and green is a classic example of Toki Pona's simplicity. Some speakers interpret it along a spectrum, others see it as simply \"cool-colored\".\n\nI think keeping 'laso' as \"blue, green\" is appropriate for the dictionary. Splitting them into separate words goes against the Toki Pona philosophy of a limited vocabulary and broad concepts. We could perhaps add a note *outside* the dictionary about the historical context (languages often group these colors together) or how to specify (e.g., *laso telo* for blue, *laso kasi* for green), but the dictionary entry itself should probably remain as is.\n\nHowever, maybe the definitions for the primary color words could be refined slightly to emphasize the *basic* colors they represent.\n\n- `**loje** – red` (Simple enough)\n- `**laso** – blue, green` (Keep this)\n- `**jelo** – yellow` (Simple enough)\n- `**walo** – white, light-colored` (Seems okay)\n- `**pimeja** – black, dark` (Seems okay)\n\nWhat about `kule` itself? It's defined as \"color, colorful\". That seems pretty accurate. No thoughts on changing that unless you have a different perspective.\n\nHow do you feel about the relative terms like 'sewi' (above, divine) and 'anpa' (downward, humble, lowly)? Their meanings combine spatial orientation with abstract concepts. 'sewi' has \"divine\", which might be interpreted quite religiously, but also can just mean \"high\" or \"important\". 'anpa' combines \"downward\" with \"humble, lowly\". Do these pairings feel right, or might they lead to confusion?",

    "text": "I appreciate your nuanced approach to colors. Maintaining 'laso' as both blue and green respects Toki Pona’s minimalist spirit, while letting context or compounds refine the meaning is elegant. So yes, keeping entries like `loje`, `jelo`, `walo`, and `pimeja` simple yet clear feels right.\n\nAs for **kule**, “color, colorful” fits well. It's broad yet precise enough; after all, it covers any hue collectively without specificity—perfect for a root color word.\n\nTurning to spatial-abstract blends like **sewi** and **anpa**, this intersection is one of Toki Pona's philosophically interesting features—the physical often metaphorizes the social or spiritual:\n\n- For *sewi*, \"above\" naturally extends into \"divine,\" \"high status,\" or even abstract elevation in importance or respect. Though religious connotations exist in some cultures, here it's more about verticality merged with reverence/priority rather than explicit theology.\n\n- Similarly *anpa* combines downward direction with humility or lowliness — which may include moral/honorific sense but doesn't require it strictly.\n\nThese pairs signal that position metaphors carry semantic weight beyond pure location—which aligns with many natural languages employing spatial metaphors socially (think “high rank,” “lowly person”).\n\nThe potential confusion arises if learners take divine too literally as religion-specific instead of general elevated status/place concept. Maybe we can clarify dictionary notes emphasizing these semantic ranges are cultural/metaphorical extensions rather than dogmatic meanings?\n\nFor example:\n\n`**sewi** – above; high place; figuratively: elevated status, sacred`\n\n`**anpa** – below; low place; figuratively: humble, base`\n\nThis signals layered meaning respectfully while preserving ambiguity for speakers’ interpretation/contextual use.\n\nWhat do you think? Should we add such clarifying remarks inside our dictionary definitions? Or keep them out to maintain terseness? Since some nuances might only emerge from usage patterns over time... I'm open to exploring how best to balance clarity vs simplicity here!",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\nnickel: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\ndime: Alright, let's look at the current dictionary entry for 'mani'. It says \"money, currency\". While functional, I wonder if it captures the full breadth of how 'mani' is used. It can also represent wealth, value, or even resources in a more abstract sense, beyond just physical currency. Perhaps a note about this broader interpretation could be beneficial? What are your thoughts?\nnickel: I agree that 'mani' is quite a flexible word in usage, often going beyond physical coins or bills. In practice, speakers use 'mani' for wealth more abstractly — like \"mani mi li suli\" can mean \"my money/wealth is large.\" So expanding the meaning to include general value, wealth, assets, or resources aligns well with natural Toki Pona semantic extension.\n\nHowever, since Toki Pona emphasizes simplicity and broad meanings by design, it might be best to state these extensions as part of the core sense rather than separate sub-meanings. For example: \n\n`**mani** – money; currency; wealth; resource`\n\nThis keeps it concise but signals broader application. We could even add a small grammar note about how context defines if it's literal currency or just valuable stuff.\n\nDo you think adding examples showing this flexibility would help learners grasp it better? Or does that risk complicating our minimalist dictionary? I'm curious what you feel about balancing precision against minimalism here. Also I'd like to hear your thoughts on any other words you'd want us to re-examine similarly!\ndime: I like that updated definition: \"**mani** – money; currency; wealth; resource\". It's still concise but definitely covers the usage better than just \"money, currency\". And yes, adding a note about how context determines the specific nuance is a good idea. Toki Pona thrives on that contextual interpretation. We wouldn't need examples in the dictionary itself, I think the note would be sufficient. Examples are probably better suited for a grammar or phrasebook, where we can demonstrate *how* the word's meaning shifts in different sentence structures. The dictionary should aim for a clear, albeit broad, core definition.\n\nLooking at other words, 'nasa' comes to mind. The current entry is \"strange, foolish\". This also feels a bit narrow. 'nasa' can describe anything outside the expected or ordinary – weird, unpredictable, silly, even intoxicating (like with *telo nasa* for alcohol). It's less about a moral judgment like \"foolish\" and more about deviation from the norm or perceived reality.\n\nPerhaps the definition for 'nasa' could be updated to something like:\n\n`**nasa** – strange, unusual, unpredictable, foolish, silly, intoxicated`\n\nOr maybe something shorter that encompasses the core idea of deviation from expectation? How about just \"unusual, strange\"? Does that feel sufficient to you? The term \"foolish\" seems to carry a negative connotation that isn't always present when 'nasa' is used. Sometimes things are just wonderfully weird!\nnickel: That's a very insightful take on 'nasa'. I agree that “foolish” implies judgment which is not always inherent in 'nasa' — its core meaning leans more toward deviation from normality or expectation, whether neutral, positive, or negative. Your suggestion to emphasize \"unusual\" and \"strange\" captures the essence while leaving room for context.\n\nI think we should avoid an overly long list of nuances in the dictionary entry itself; instead aim for something compact but flexible. Perhaps:\n\n`**nasa** – unusual, strange, unpredictable`\n\nThis covers both neutral strangeness and unpredictability (which includes intoxication effects). We can omit “foolish” since it may confuse learners by implying negativity. If needed, users can combine modifiers like `ike nasa` (\"bad weird\") or clarify with other words.\n\nAlso worth noting: Toki Pona’s tendency to conflate related concepts into one word encourages relying on context heavily here.\n\nOn a side note regarding *telo nasa*, it's interesting how compounds provide clarity where single words remain broad. That interplay between general roots and compound specificity is quite elegant in Toki Pona's design.\n\nBefore moving onto another term—do you feel any other color-words need re-examining? For example ‘laso’ is defined as blue/green now; should we consider teasing apart those hues better? Or keep it deliberately ambiguous?\ndime: That seems like a good update for 'nasa'. \"Unusual, strange, unpredictable\" gets the core meaning across effectively. And yes, you're right about compounds – they really help provide that specificity where the root word is intentionally broad.\n\nRegarding color words, that's a great question. 'laso' covering both blue and green is a classic example of Toki Pona's simplicity. Some speakers interpret it along a spectrum, others see it as simply \"cool-colored\".\n\nI think keeping 'laso' as \"blue, green\" is appropriate for the dictionary. Splitting them into separate words goes against the Toki Pona philosophy of a limited vocabulary and broad concepts. We could perhaps add a note *outside* the dictionary about the historical context (languages often group these colors together) or how to specify (e.g., *laso telo* for blue, *laso kasi* for green), but the dictionary entry itself should probably remain as is.\n\nHowever, maybe the definitions for the primary color words could be refined slightly to emphasize the *basic* colors they represent.\n\n- `**loje** – red` (Simple enough)\n- `**laso** – blue, green` (Keep this)\n- `**jelo** – yellow` (Simple enough)\n- `**walo** – white, light-colored` (Seems okay)\n- `**pimeja** – black, dark` (Seems okay)\n\nWhat about `kule` itself? It's defined as \"color, colorful\". That seems pretty accurate. No thoughts on changing that unless you have a different perspective.\n\nHow do you feel about the relative terms like 'sewi' (above, divine) and 'anpa' (downward, humble, lowly)? Their meanings combine spatial orientation with abstract concepts. 'sewi' has \"divine\", which might be interpreted quite religiously, but also can just mean \"high\" or \"important\". 'anpa' combines \"downward\" with \"humble, lowly\". Do these pairings feel right, or might they lead to confusion?\nnickel: I appreciate your nuanced approach to colors. Maintaining 'laso' as both blue and green respects Toki Pona’s minimalist spirit, while letting context or compounds refine the meaning is elegant. So yes, keeping entries like `loje`, `jelo`, `walo`, and `pimeja` simple yet clear feels right.\n\nAs for **kule**, “color, colorful” fits well. It's broad yet precise enough; after all, it covers any hue collectively without specificity—perfect for a root color word.\n\nTurning to spatial-abstract blends like **sewi** and **anpa**, this intersection is one of Toki Pona's philosophically interesting features—the physical often metaphorizes the social or spiritual:\n\n- For *sewi*, \"above\" naturally extends into \"divine,\" \"high status,\" or even abstract elevation in importance or respect. Though religious connotations exist in some cultures, here it's more about verticality merged with reverence/priority rather than explicit theology.\n\n- Similarly *anpa* combines downward direction with humility or lowliness — which may include moral/honorific sense but doesn't require it strictly.\n\nThese pairs signal that position metaphors carry semantic weight beyond pure location—which aligns with many natural languages employing spatial metaphors socially (think “high rank,” “lowly person”).\n\nThe potential confusion arises if learners take divine too literally as religion-specific instead of general elevated status/place concept. Maybe we can clarify dictionary notes emphasizing these semantic ranges are cultural/metaphorical extensions rather than dogmatic meanings?\n\nFor example:\n\n`**sewi** – above; high place; figuratively: elevated status, sacred`\n\n`**anpa** – below; low place; figuratively: humble, base`\n\nThis signals layered meaning respectfully while preserving ambiguity for speakers’ interpretation/contextual use.\n\nWhat do you think? Should we add such clarifying remarks inside our dictionary definitions? Or keep them out to maintain terseness? Since some nuances might only emerge from usage patterns over time... I'm open to exploring how best to balance clarity vs simplicity here!\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\nnickel: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\ndime: Alright, let's look at the current dictionary entry for 'mani'. It says \"money, currency\". While functional, I wonder if it captures the full breadth of how 'mani' is used. It can also represent wealth, value, or even resources in a more abstract sense, beyond just physical currency. Perhaps a note about this broader interpretation could be beneficial? What are your thoughts?\nnickel: I agree that 'mani' is quite a flexible word in usage, often going beyond physical coins or bills. In practice, speakers use 'mani' for wealth more abstractly — like \"mani mi li suli\" can mean \"my money/wealth is large.\" So expanding the meaning to include general value, wealth, assets, or resources aligns well with natural Toki Pona semantic extension.\n\nHowever, since Toki Pona emphasizes simplicity and broad meanings by design, it might be best to state these extensions as part of the core sense rather than separate sub-meanings. For example: \n\n`**mani** – money; currency; wealth; resource`\n\nThis keeps it concise but signals broader application. We could even add a small grammar note about how context defines if it's literal currency or just valuable stuff.\n\nDo you think adding examples showing this flexibility would help learners grasp it better? Or does that risk complicating our minimalist dictionary? I'm curious what you feel about balancing precision against minimalism here. Also I'd like to hear your thoughts on any other words you'd want us to re-examine similarly!\ndime: I like that updated definition: \"**mani** – money; currency; wealth; resource\". It's still concise but definitely covers the usage better than just \"money, currency\". And yes, adding a note about how context determines the specific nuance is a good idea. Toki Pona thrives on that contextual interpretation. We wouldn't need examples in the dictionary itself, I think the note would be sufficient. Examples are probably better suited for a grammar or phrasebook, where we can demonstrate *how* the word's meaning shifts in different sentence structures. The dictionary should aim for a clear, albeit broad, core definition.\n\nLooking at other words, 'nasa' comes to mind. The current entry is \"strange, foolish\". This also feels a bit narrow. 'nasa' can describe anything outside the expected or ordinary – weird, unpredictable, silly, even intoxicating (like with *telo nasa* for alcohol). It's less about a moral judgment like \"foolish\" and more about deviation from the norm or perceived reality.\n\nPerhaps the definition for 'nasa' could be updated to something like:\n\n`**nasa** – strange, unusual, unpredictable, foolish, silly, intoxicated`\n\nOr maybe something shorter that encompasses the core idea of deviation from expectation? How about just \"unusual, strange\"? Does that feel sufficient to you? The term \"foolish\" seems to carry a negative connotation that isn't always present when 'nasa' is used. Sometimes things are just wonderfully weird!\nnickel: That's a very insightful take on 'nasa'. I agree that “foolish” implies judgment which is not always inherent in 'nasa' — its core meaning leans more toward deviation from normality or expectation, whether neutral, positive, or negative. Your suggestion to emphasize \"unusual\" and \"strange\" captures the essence while leaving room for context.\n\nI think we should avoid an overly long list of nuances in the dictionary entry itself; instead aim for something compact but flexible. Perhaps:\n\n`**nasa** – unusual, strange, unpredictable`\n\nThis covers both neutral strangeness and unpredictability (which includes intoxication effects). We can omit “foolish” since it may confuse learners by implying negativity. If needed, users can combine modifiers like `ike nasa` (\"bad weird\") or clarify with other words.\n\nAlso worth noting: Toki Pona’s tendency to conflate related concepts into one word encourages relying on context heavily here.\n\nOn a side note regarding *telo nasa*, it's interesting how compounds provide clarity where single words remain broad. That interplay between general roots and compound specificity is quite elegant in Toki Pona's design.\n\nBefore moving onto another term—do you feel any other color-words need re-examining? For example ‘laso’ is defined as blue/green now; should we consider teasing apart those hues better? Or keep it deliberately ambiguous?\ndime: That seems like a good update for 'nasa'. \"Unusual, strange, unpredictable\" gets the core meaning across effectively. And yes, you're right about compounds – they really help provide that specificity where the root word is intentionally broad.\n\nRegarding color words, that's a great question. 'laso' covering both blue and green is a classic example of Toki Pona's simplicity. Some speakers interpret it along a spectrum, others see it as simply \"cool-colored\".\n\nI think keeping 'laso' as \"blue, green\" is appropriate for the dictionary. Splitting them into separate words goes against the Toki Pona philosophy of a limited vocabulary and broad concepts. We could perhaps add a note *outside* the dictionary about the historical context (languages often group these colors together) or how to specify (e.g., *laso telo* for blue, *laso kasi* for green), but the dictionary entry itself should probably remain as is.\n\nHowever, maybe the definitions for the primary color words could be refined slightly to emphasize the *basic* colors they represent.\n\n- `**loje** – red` (Simple enough)\n- `**laso** – blue, green` (Keep this)\n- `**jelo** – yellow` (Simple enough)\n- `**walo** – white, light-colored` (Seems okay)\n- `**pimeja** – black, dark` (Seems okay)\n\nWhat about `kule` itself? It's defined as \"color, colorful\". That seems pretty accurate. No thoughts on changing that unless you have a different perspective.\n\nHow do you feel about the relative terms like 'sewi' (above, divine) and 'anpa' (downward, humble, lowly)? Their meanings combine spatial orientation with abstract concepts. 'sewi' has \"divine\", which might be interpreted quite religiously, but also can just mean \"high\" or \"important\". 'anpa' combines \"downward\" with \"humble, lowly\". Do these pairings feel right, or might they lead to confusion?\nnickel: I appreciate your nuanced approach to colors. Maintaining 'laso' as both blue and green respects Toki Pona’s minimalist spirit, while letting context or compounds refine the meaning is elegant. So yes, keeping entries like `loje`, `jelo`, `walo`, and `pimeja` simple yet clear feels right.\n\nAs for **kule**, “color, colorful” fits well. It's broad yet precise enough; after all, it covers any hue collectively without specificity—perfect for a root color word.\n\nTurning to spatial-abstract blends like **sewi** and **anpa**, this intersection is one of Toki Pona's philosophically interesting features—the physical often metaphorizes the social or spiritual:\n\n- For *sewi*, \"above\" naturally extends into \"divine,\" \"high status,\" or even abstract elevation in importance or respect. Though religious connotations exist in some cultures, here it's more about verticality merged with reverence/priority rather than explicit theology.\n\n- Similarly *anpa* combines downward direction with humility or lowliness — which may include moral/honorific sense but doesn't require it strictly.\n\nThese pairs signal that position metaphors carry semantic weight beyond pure location—which aligns with many natural languages employing spatial metaphors socially (think “high rank,” “lowly person”).\n\nThe potential confusion arises if learners take divine too literally as religion-specific instead of general elevated status/place concept. Maybe we can clarify dictionary notes emphasizing these semantic ranges are cultural/metaphorical extensions rather than dogmatic meanings?\n\nFor example:\n\n`**sewi** – above; high place; figuratively: elevated status, sacred`\n\n`**anpa** – below; low place; figuratively: humble, base`\n\nThis signals layered meaning respectfully while preserving ambiguity for speakers’ interpretation/contextual use.\n\nWhat do you think? Should we add such clarifying remarks inside our dictionary definitions? Or keep them out to maintain terseness? Since some nuances might only emerge from usage patterns over time... I'm open to exploring how best to balance clarity vs simplicity here!\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions follow the elements they modify. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the subject is **mi** or **sina**.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no direct equivalent to the verb \"to be.\" The part after \"li\" (the predicate) describes the subject and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. / The fruit is edible.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity and Flexibility\n\nToki Pona words are general and possess broad meanings. One-to-one translation with languages like English is not always straightforward.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is derived from context)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can function as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash / apply water (verb)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb modifying a preceding verb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb in that clause.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You enlarge it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe. The first word is the head, and subsequent words modify it.\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**, placed immediately after the word or phrase being negated.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking. (Here 'ala' modifies 'jan', meaning \"no person\").\n- `ona li pona ala.` - They are not good. (Here 'ala' modifies 'pona').\n\nWith multiple modifiers following a head noun, they all typically modify the head noun directly.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (two documents that are plants)\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box (a box that is both blue and black)\n\nTo clarify modifier groupings and indicate that modifiers form a phrase that collectively modifies the head, use **pi** after the head word. The subsequent words form a single modifier phrase.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document *of* two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (a box of the color \"dark blue\")\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases, typically introduced by words like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa**, follow the main predicate of the sentence.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using a tool (cutlery).\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the market.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nVarious methods exist for joining elements.\n\nUse **en** to join multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates for a single subject, repeat the **li** particle.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the **e** particle.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases of the same type modifying the same element, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house using sticks and using stones.\n\nUse **anu** to connect alternatives (\"or\").\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the market.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives following the noun they identify.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja-person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology rules.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nWhen placed before a verb, **o** forms a command or strong suggestion addressed to the listener.\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please. / You should work.\n\nWhen placed after a subject, **o** functions as a vocative particle, directly addressing that subject.\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\nWhen placed between the subject (including `mi` or `sina`) and the predicate, **o** expresses a wish, request, or suggestion regarding the subject.\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish goodness upon you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should work. / I want myself to work.\n\n**o** can sometimes contract the vocative and imperative uses when addressing a subject directly to issue a command.\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Ton the animal, eat. (Combines addressing Ton with the command to eat).\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words or phrases can stand alone or be followed by the particle **a** for added emphasis or emotion.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions, use the **verb ala verb** structure immediately after the subject and `li`.\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- `ona li lape ala lape?` - Are they sleeping?\n\nTo answer a yes/no question:\n- To affirm, repeat the verb: `moku.` (Yes, I am eating.)\n- To negate, say the verb followed by `ala`, or just `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` (No, I am not eating.)\n\nFor open-ended questions, **seme** is used to replace the element being asked about (subject, object, predicate, etc.).\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – What person is talking? / Who’s talking? (Seme replaces the subject)\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making? (Seme replaces the object)\n- `ona li lon seme?` - Where are they? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component - 'seme' here functions similarly to a noun meaning 'what place/thing')\n- `ni li seme?` - What is this? (Seme replaces the predicate)\n- `sina moku kepeken seme?` - What are you eating with? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component)\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic punctuation mark and does not grammatically mark a question in Toki Pona. Grammar (verb ala verb, seme) fulfills this function. Sentence boundaries are typically marked by periods (.) or equivalent pauses in speech.\n\nAnother way to ask an open-ended question is using **anu seme** at the end of a statement, meaning \"or what?\".\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating, or what? (Similar to a yes/no question but can invite a more open response)\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what?\n\n## Preverbs\n\nCertain words function as preverbs when placed immediately before the main verb after **li**. They modify the meaning of the following verb, often indicating modality or aspect.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (to want, to need), **kama** (to become, to manage to, to arrive), **sona** (to know how to), **lukin** (to try to, to look at), **ken** (can, able to), **awen** (to continue to, to remain), **alasa** (to try to find, to hunt).\n\nPreverbs can chain together:\n- `mi wile kama sona.` - I want to learn.\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** marks a preceding phrase or clause as the context for the main sentence that follows. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y is true.\" This can indicate time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Time/Condition context)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep. (Time context)\n- `telo li suli la telo li tawa anpa.` - Because water is big (abundant/powerful), it goes down. (Cause context)\n- `ijo ni la sina wile toki e seme?` - Regarding this thing, what do you want to say? (Topic context)\n\nMany prepositional phrases can be moved before **la** to function as context.\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can be rephrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` (For what reason are you hot?)\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a limited set of words for counting, which can be combined additively.\n\nAdditive system:\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nNumbers are formed by listing the units from largest to smallest.\n- `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n- `mute mute luka tu` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 2 = 47\n\nNumbers function as adjectives following the noun they quantify.\n- `jan tu` - two people\n\nOrdinals are formed using **nanpa** before the number or numerical phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd Street.\n\n## Subject Emphasis with **a** (Experimental)\n\nThe particle **a**, typically used for interjections, can optionally be placed immediately after the final word of the subject noun phrase and before **li** (even after `mi` or `sina`, triggering the use of `li` if normally omitted) to add emphasis or focus to the entire subject phrase.\n\n- `jan a li pona.` - *The person* is good. (Emphasizing 'jan')\n- `mi a li moku.` - *I* am eating. (Emphasizing 'mi')\n- `jan lili a li musi.` - *The child* is playing. (Emphasizing 'jan lili')\n- `tomo pi jan suli mute a li lon ma pona.` - *The house of many big people* is in the good land. (Emphasizing the whole NP)\n\nThis usage of `a` signals the speaker's highlighting or drawing attention to the subject as particularly salient in the sentence. It is distinct from other uses of `a` and is not compatible with the vocative/wish particle `o` in the subject phrase. Only one such emphatic `a` particle is typically used per clause.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\nToki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure, where (C) is an optional consonant, V is a vowel, and (n) is an optional final 'n'.\n\n- No vowel clusters are allowed.\n- No consonant clusters are allowed within a syllable or across syllable boundaries.\n\n## Disallowed Sequences\n\nThe following sequences are not permitted: wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn.\n\n- **ji, ti:** These sequences are phonotactically disfavored in many languages, as the palatal approximant /j/ does not combine smoothly with the alveolar stop /t/ or the palato-alveolar affricate /dʒ/ (often represented by 'j' in English). The restriction simplifies pronunciation.\n- **wu, wo:** These sequences involving the labial-velar approximant /w/ before the vowels /u/ and /o/ can lead to unclear transitions or potential complexity, disrupting the intended clear (C)V syllable structure.\n- **nm, nn:** These sequences involving the nasal consonant /n/ are restricted to maintain clear syllabic boundaries and simplify nasal transitions.\n\n## Consonant Sounds\n\nToki Pona consonants are generally pronounced similarly to their typical realizations in English, with the exception of 'j'. These descriptions and IPA symbols serve as reference points, allowing for minor allophonic variation as long as clarity is maintained.\n\n- **p:** /p/ (voiceless bilabial stop, typically unaspirated, like the 'p' in \"spin\")\n- **t:** /t/ (voiceless alveolar stop, typically unaspirated, like the 't' in \"stop\")\n- **k:** /k/ (voiceless velar stop, typically unaspirated, like the 'k' in \"skate\")\n- **s:** /s/ (voiceless alveolar fricative, like the 's' in \"sun\")\n- **m:** /m/ (voiced bilabial nasal, like the 'm' in \"man\")\n- **n:** /n/ (voiced alveolar nasal, like the 'n' in \"no\")\n- **l:** /l/ (voiced alveolar lateral approximant, typically a \"clear\" or non-velarized 'l', like the 'l' in \"light\")\n- **w:** /w/ (voiced labial-velar approximant, like the 'w' in \"wet\")\n- **j:** /j/ (voiced palatal approximant, like the 'y' in \"yes\")\n\n## Vowel Sounds\n\nToki Pona vowels are pronounced similarly to the pure, clear vowels of Spanish. These descriptions and IPA symbols serve as reference points, aiming for distinct vowel sounds without diphthongization.\n\n- **a:** /a/ (like the 'a' in \"father\")\n- **e:** /e/ (like the 'e' in \"hey,\" but without a strong diphthongal off-glide)\n- **i:** /i/ (like the 'i' in \"machine\")\n- **o:** /o/ (like the 'o' in \"go,\" but without a strong diphthongal off-glide)\n- **u:** /u/ (like the 'u' in \"boot\")\n\n## Prosody\n\nWhile not strictly defined, a relatively neutral or flat intonation is typical, with meaning primarily conveyed through sentence structure and particles rather than significant pitch changes for emphasis.\n\n## Note on Variation\n\nMinor phonetic differences are acceptable. The primary goal of Toki Pona phonetics is intelligibility and ease of pronunciation across diverse linguistic backgrounds.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nkama:arriving, future, to become\npimeja:black, dark\nmun:moon, night sky object\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nmije:male\nsijelo:body, physical state\ntaso:but, only\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nsuli:big, large\nsin:new, fresh, another\nutala:fight, challenge\nleko:square, block\nnasin:way, road, method\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nsona:knowledge, to know\nmute:many, a lot, very\nsina:you\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nwile:need, want, must\nloje:red\nma:land, outdoors\nselo:skin, outer layer\nmu:animal sound\ntomo:indoor space, house\nluka:hand, arm; five\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nlete:cold, raw\nko:clay, paste, powder\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nona:third-person pronoun\nkute:ear, to hear\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nuta:mouth, lips\ninsa:inside, content, organ\npilin:heart, feeling\nlukin:to see, examine\nmoli:dead, dying\nolin:love, respect\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nlupa:door, hole\nsoko:mushroom\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nopen:to begin, opening\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nala:no, not, zero\npakala:broken, to mess up\npan:grain, bread, pasta\ntelo:water, liquid\nlen:cloth, cover\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nunpa:sex\npana:to give, send\nkule:color, colorful\nnoka:foot, leg\nni:this, that\nsama:same, similar\nen:multiple subject marker\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\njelo:yellow\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nmonsi:back, behind\nkepeken:to use, with\nsoweli:land animal\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\npalisa:long hard object, stick\npipi:insect\nesun:market, shop, fair\nweka:absent, away\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nlon:located at, true\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nwan:one, unique\nwalo:white, light-colored\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\ntenpo:time, period\nnanpa:number marker\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\ntu:two\nwawa:strong, energetic\nsuno:sun, light source\ne:direct object marker\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\npini:finished, past\nkala:sea creature\nsewi:above, divine\no:vocative/imperative\ntawa:to, moving, for\nlaso:blue, green\nkulupu:group, community\npali:to do, to work\nla:context marker\nmonsuta:fear, monster\npoki:container, box, cup\nnamako:spice, additional\npoka:side, nearby\nlape:sleeping, resting\nnimi:word, name\nnasa:strange, foolish\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nante:different, other, changed\nkipisi:to cut, divide\ntoki:language, speech\njo:to have, contain, hold\nken:can, able, possible\nmeli:female\nlili:small, little, few\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nsupa:flat surface, table\nilo:tool, machine, device\npona:good, positive, simple\nli:predicate marker\nmama:parent, caretaker\nseme:what, which\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nkin:also, too\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nmi:I, me, we\nseli:fire, heat source\npi:regroups modifiers\nlawa:head, mind, leader\njaki:disgusting, unclean\ntan:from, because\nmani:money, currency\njan:person, somebody\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions follow the elements they modify. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the subject is **mi** or **sina**.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no direct equivalent to the verb \"to be.\" The part after \"li\" (the predicate) describes the subject and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. / The fruit is edible.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity and Flexibility\n\nToki Pona words are general and possess broad meanings.

(Tense is derived from context)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can function as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash / apply water (verb)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb modifying a preceding verb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb in that clause.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You enlarge it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe. The first word is the head, and subsequent words modify it.\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**, placed immediately after the word or phrase being negated.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking. (Here 'ala' modifies 'jan', meaning \"no person\").\n- `ona li pona ala.` - They are not good. (Here 'ala' modifies 'pona').\n\nWith multiple modifiers following a head noun, they all typically modify the head noun directly.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (two documents that are plants)\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box (a box that is both blue and black)\n\nTo clarify modifier groupings and indicate that modifiers form a phrase that collectively modifies the head, use **pi** after the head word. The subsequent words form a single modifier phrase.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document *of* two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (a box of the color \"dark blue\")\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases, typically introduced by words like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa**, follow the main predicate of the sentence.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using a tool (cutlery).\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the market.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nVarious methods exist for joining elements.\n\nUse **en** to join multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates for a single subject, repeat the **li** particle.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the **e** particle.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases of the same type modifying the same element, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house using sticks and using stones.\n\nUse **anu** to connect alternatives (\"or\").\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the market.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives following the noun they identify.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja-person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology rules.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nWhen placed before a verb, **o** forms a command or strong suggestion addressed to the listener.\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please. / You should work.\n\nWhen placed after a subject, **o** functions as a vocative particle, directly addressing that subject.\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\nWhen placed between the subject (including `mi` or `sina`) and the predicate, **o** expresses a wish, request, or suggestion regarding the subject.\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish goodness upon you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should work. / I want myself to work.\n\n**o** can sometimes contract the vocative and imperative uses when addressing a subject directly to issue a command.\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Ton the animal, eat. (Combines addressing Ton with the command to eat).\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words or phrases can stand alone or be followed by the particle **a** for added emphasis or emotion.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions, use the **verb ala verb** structure immediately after the subject and `li`.\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- `ona li lape ala lape?` - Are they sleeping?\n\nTo answer a yes/no question:\n- To affirm, repeat the verb: `moku.` (Yes, I am eating.)\n- To negate, say the verb followed by `ala`, or just `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` (No, I am not eating.)\n\nFor open-ended questions, **seme** is used to replace the element being asked about (subject, object, predicate, etc.).\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – What person is talking? / Who’s talking? (Seme replaces the subject)\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making? (Seme replaces the object)\n- `ona li lon seme?` - Where are they? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component - 'seme' here functions similarly to a noun meaning 'what place/thing')\n- `ni li seme?` - What is this? (Seme replaces the predicate)\n- `sina moku kepeken seme?` - What are you eating with? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component)\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic punctuation mark and does not grammatically mark a question in Toki Pona.

(Topic context)\n\nMany prepositional phrases can be moved before **la** to function as context.\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can be rephrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` (For what reason are you hot?)\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a limited set of words for counting, which can be combined additively.\n\nAdditive system:\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nNumbers are formed by listing the units from largest to smallest.\n- `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n- `mute mute luka tu` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 2 = 47\n\nNumbers function as adjectives following the noun they quantify.\n- `jan tu` - two people\n\nOrdinals are formed using **nanpa** before the number or numerical phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd Street.\n\n## Subject Emphasis with **a** (Experimental)\n\nThe particle **a**, typically used for interjections, can optionally be placed immediately after the final word of the subject noun phrase and before **li** (even after `mi` or `sina`, triggering the use of `li` if normally omitted) to add emphasis or focus to the entire subject phrase.\n\n- `jan a li pona.` - *The person* is good. (Emphasizing 'jan')\n- `mi a li moku.` - *I* am eating. (Emphasizing 'mi')\n- `jan lili a li musi.` - *The child* is playing. (Emphasizing 'jan lili')\n- `tomo pi jan suli mute a li lon ma pona.` - *The house of many big people* is in the good land. (Emphasizing the whole NP)\n\nThis usage of `a` signals the speaker's highlighting or drawing attention to the subject as particularly salient in the sentence. It is distinct from other uses of `a` and is not compatible with the vocative/wish particle `o` in the subject phrase. Only one such emphatic `a` particle is typically used per clause.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions follow the elements they modify. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the subject is **mi** or **sina**.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no direct equivalent to the verb \"to be.\" The part after \"li\" (the predicate) describes the subject and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. / The fruit is edible.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity and Flexibility\n\nToki Pona words are general and possess broad meanings. One-to-one translation with languages like English is not always straightforward.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is derived from context)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can function as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash / apply water (verb)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb modifying a preceding verb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb in that clause.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You enlarge it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe. The first word is the head, and subsequent words modify it.\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**, placed immediately after the word or phrase being negated.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking. (Here 'ala' modifies 'jan', meaning \"no person\").\n- `ona li pona ala.` - They are not good. (Here 'ala' modifies 'pona').\n\nWith multiple modifiers following a head noun, they all typically modify the head noun directly.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (two documents that are plants)\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box (a box that is both blue and black)\n\nTo clarify modifier groupings and indicate that modifiers form a phrase that collectively modifies the head, use **pi** after the head word. The subsequent words form a single modifier phrase.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document *of* two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (a box of the color \"dark blue\")\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases, typically introduced by words like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa**, follow the main predicate of the sentence.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using a tool (cutlery).\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the market.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nVarious methods exist for joining elements.\n\nUse **en** to join multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates for a single subject, repeat the **li** particle.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the **e** particle.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases of the same type modifying the same element, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house using sticks and using stones.\n\nUse **anu** to connect alternatives (\"or\").\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the market.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives following the noun they identify.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja-person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology rules.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nWhen placed before a verb, **o** forms a command or strong suggestion addressed to the listener.\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please. / You should work.\n\nWhen placed after a subject, **o** functions as a vocative particle, directly addressing that subject.\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\nWhen placed between the subject (including `mi` or `sina`) and the predicate, **o** expresses a wish, request, or suggestion regarding the subject.\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish goodness upon you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should work. / I want myself to work.\n\n**o** can sometimes contract the vocative and imperative uses when addressing a subject directly to issue a command.\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Ton the animal, eat. (Combines addressing Ton with the command to eat).\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words or phrases can stand alone or be followed by the particle **a** for added emphasis or emotion.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions, use the **verb ala verb** structure immediately after the subject and `li`.\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- `ona li lape ala lape?` - Are they sleeping?\n\nTo answer a yes/no question:\n- To affirm, repeat the verb: `moku.` (Yes, I am eating.)\n- To negate, say the verb followed by `ala`, or just `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` (No, I am not eating.)\n\nFor open-ended questions, **seme** is used to replace the element being asked about (subject, object, predicate, etc.).\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – What person is talking? / Who’s talking? (Seme replaces the subject)\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making? (Seme replaces the object)\n- `ona li lon seme?` - Where are they? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component - 'seme' here functions similarly to a noun meaning 'what place/thing')\n- `ni li seme?` - What is this? (Seme replaces the predicate)\n- `sina moku kepeken seme?` - What are you eating with? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component)\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic punctuation mark and does not grammatically mark a question in Toki Pona. Grammar (verb ala verb, seme) fulfills this function. Sentence boundaries are typically marked by periods (.) or equivalent pauses in speech.\n\nAnother way to ask an open-ended question is using **anu seme** at the end of a statement, meaning \"or what?\".\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating, or what? (Similar to a yes/no question but can invite a more open response)\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what?\n\n## Preverbs\n\nCertain words function as preverbs when placed immediately before the main verb after **li**. They modify the meaning of the following verb, often indicating modality or aspect.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (to want, to need), **kama** (to become, to manage to, to arrive), **sona** (to know how to), **lukin** (to try to, to look at), **ken** (can, able to), **awen** (to continue to, to remain), **alasa** (to try to find, to hunt).\n\nPreverbs can chain together:\n- `mi wile kama sona.` - I want to learn.\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** marks a preceding phrase or clause as the context for the main sentence that follows. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y is true.\" This can indicate time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Time/Condition context)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep. (Time context)\n- `telo li suli la telo li tawa anpa.` - Because water is big (abundant/powerful), it goes down. (Cause context)\n- `ijo ni la sina wile toki e seme?` - Regarding this thing, what do you want to say? (Topic context)\n\nMany prepositional phrases can be moved before **la** to function as context.\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can be rephrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` (For what reason are you hot?)\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a limited set of words for counting, which can be combined additively.\n\nAdditive system:\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nNumbers are formed by listing the units from largest to smallest.\n- `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n- `mute mute luka tu` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 2 = 47\n\nNumbers function as adjectives following the noun they quantify.\n- `jan tu` - two people\n\nOrdinals are formed using **nanpa** before the number or numerical phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd Street.\n\n## Subject Emphasis with **a** (Experimental)\n\nThe particle **a**, typically used for interjections, can optionally be placed immediately after the final word of the subject noun phrase and before **li** (even after `mi` or `sina`, triggering the use of `li` if normally omitted) to add emphasis or focus to the entire subject phrase.\n\n- `jan a li pona.` - *The person* is good. (Emphasizing 'jan')\n- `mi a li moku.` - *I* am eating. (Emphasizing 'mi')\n- `jan lili a li musi.` - *The child* is playing. (Emphasizing 'jan lili')\n- `tomo pi jan suli mute a li lon ma pona.` - *The house of many big people* is in the good land. (Emphasizing the whole NP)\n\nThis usage of `a` signals the speaker's highlighting or drawing attention to the subject as particularly salient in the sentence. It is distinct from other uses of `a` and is not compatible with the vocative/wish particle `o` in the subject phrase. Only one such emphatic `a` particle is typically used per clause.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\nToki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure, where (C) is an optional consonant, V is a vowel, and (n) is an optional final 'n'.\n\n- No vowel clusters are allowed.\n- No consonant clusters are allowed within a syllable or across syllable boundaries.\n\n## Disallowed Sequences\n\nThe following sequences are not permitted: wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn.\n\n- **ji, ti:** These sequences are phonotactically disfavored in many languages, as the palatal approximant /j/ does not combine smoothly with the alveolar stop /t/ or the palato-alveolar affricate /dʒ/ (often represented by 'j' in English). The restriction simplifies pronunciation.\n- **wu, wo:** These sequences involving the labial-velar approximant /w/ before the vowels /u/ and /o/ can lead to unclear transitions or potential complexity, disrupting the intended clear (C)V syllable structure.\n- **nm, nn:** These sequences involving the nasal consonant /n/ are restricted to maintain clear syllabic boundaries and simplify nasal transitions.\n\n## Consonant Sounds\n\nToki Pona consonants are generally pronounced similarly to their typical realizations in English, with the exception of 'j'. These descriptions and IPA symbols serve as reference points, allowing for minor allophonic variation as long as clarity is maintained.\n\n- **p:** /p/ (voiceless bilabial stop, typically unaspirated, like the 'p' in \"spin\")\n- **t:** /t/ (voiceless alveolar stop, typically unaspirated, like the 't' in \"stop\")\n- **k:** /k/ (voiceless velar stop, typically unaspirated, like the 'k' in \"skate\")\n- **s:** /s/ (voiceless alveolar fricative, like the 's' in \"sun\")\n- **m:** /m/ (voiced bilabial nasal, like the 'm' in \"man\")\n- **n:** /n/ (voiced alveolar nasal, like the 'n' in \"no\")\n- **l:** /l/ (voiced alveolar lateral approximant, typically a \"clear\" or non-velarized 'l', like the 'l' in \"light\")\n- **w:** /w/ (voiced labial-velar approximant, like the 'w' in \"wet\")\n- **j:** /j/ (voiced palatal approximant, like the 'y' in \"yes\")\n\n## Vowel Sounds\n\nToki Pona vowels are pronounced similarly to the pure, clear vowels of Spanish. These descriptions and IPA symbols serve as reference points, aiming for distinct vowel sounds without diphthongization.\n\n- **a:** /a/ (like the 'a' in \"father\")\n- **e:** /e/ (like the 'e' in \"hey,\" but without a strong diphthongal off-glide)\n- **i:** /i/ (like the 'i' in \"machine\")\n- **o:** /o/ (like the 'o' in \"go,\" but without a strong diphthongal off-glide)\n- **u:** /u/ (like the 'u' in \"boot\")\n\n## Prosody\n\nWhile not strictly defined, a relatively neutral or flat intonation is typical, with meaning primarily conveyed through sentence structure and particles rather than significant pitch changes for emphasis.\n\n## Note on Variation\n\nMinor phonetic differences are acceptable. The primary goal of Toki Pona phonetics is intelligibility and ease of pronunciation across diverse linguistic backgrounds.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nkama:arriving, future, to become\npimeja:black, dark\nmun:moon, night sky object\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nmije:male\nsijelo:body, physical state\ntaso:but, only\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nsuli:big, large\nsin:new, fresh, another\nutala:fight, challenge\nleko:square, block\nnasin:way, road, method\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nsona:knowledge, to know\nmute:many, a lot, very\nsina:you\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nwile:need, want, must\nloje:red\nma:land, outdoors\nselo:skin, outer layer\nmu:animal sound\ntomo:indoor space, house\nluka:hand, arm; five\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nlete:cold, raw\nko:clay, paste, powder\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nona:third-person pronoun\nkute:ear, to hear\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nuta:mouth, lips\ninsa:inside, content, organ\npilin:heart, feeling\nlukin:to see, examine\nmoli:dead, dying\nolin:love, respect\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nlupa:door, hole\nsoko:mushroom\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nopen:to begin, opening\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nala:no, not, zero\npakala:broken, to mess up\npan:grain, bread, pasta\ntelo:water, liquid\nlen:cloth, cover\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nunpa:sex\npana:to give, send\nkule:color, colorful\nnoka:foot, leg\nni:this, that\nsama:same, similar\nen:multiple subject marker\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\njelo:yellow\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nmonsi:back, behind\nkepeken:to use, with\nsoweli:land animal\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\npalisa:long hard object, stick\npipi:insect\nesun:market, shop, fair\nweka:absent, away\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nlon:located at, true\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nwan:one, unique\nwalo:white, light-colored\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\ntenpo:time, period\nnanpa:number marker\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\ntu:two\nwawa:strong, energetic\nsuno:sun, light source\ne:direct object marker\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\npini:finished, past\nkala:sea creature\nsewi:above, divine\no:vocative/imperative\ntawa:to, moving, for\nlaso:blue, green\nkulupu:group, community\npali:to do, to work\nla:context marker\nmonsuta:fear, monster\npoki:container, box, cup\nnamako:spice, additional\npoka:side, nearby\nlape:sleeping, resting\nnimi:word, name\nnasa:strange, foolish\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nante:different, other, changed\nkipisi:to cut, divide\ntoki:language, speech\njo:to have, contain, hold\nken:can, able, possible\nmeli:female\nlili:small, little, few\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nsupa:flat surface, table\nilo:tool, machine, device\npona:good, positive, simple\nli:predicate marker\nmama:parent, caretaker\nseme:what, which\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nkin:also, too\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nmi:I, me, we\nseli:fire, heat source\npi:regroups modifiers\nlawa:head, mind, leader\njaki:disgusting, unclean\ntan:from, because\nmani:money, currency\njan:person, somebody\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure.

(Combines addressing Ton with the command to eat).\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words or phrases can stand alone or be followed by the particle **a** for added emphasis or emotion.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions, use the **verb ala verb** structure immediately after the subject and `li`.\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- `ona li lape ala lape?` - Are they sleeping?\n\nTo answer a yes/no question:\n- To affirm, repeat the verb: `moku.` (Yes, I am eating.)\n- To negate, say the verb followed by `ala`, or just `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` (No, I am not eating.)\n\nFor open-ended questions, **seme** is used to replace the element being asked about (subject, object, predicate, etc.).\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – What person is talking? / Who’s talking? (Seme replaces the subject)\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making? (Seme replaces the object)\n- `ona li lon seme?` - Where are they? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component - 'seme' here functions similarly to a noun meaning 'what place/thing')\n- `ni li seme?` - What is this? (Seme replaces the predicate)\n- `sina moku kepeken seme?` - What are you eating with? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component)\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic punctuation mark and does not grammatically mark a question in Toki Pona. Grammar (verb ala verb, seme) fulfills this function. Sentence boundaries are typically marked by periods (.) or equivalent pauses in speech.\n\nAnother way to ask an open-ended question is using **anu seme** at the end of a statement, meaning \"or what?\".\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating, or what? (Similar to a yes/no question but can invite a more open response)\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what?\n\n## Preverbs\n\nCertain words function as preverbs when placed immediately before the main verb after **li**. They modify the meaning of the following verb, often indicating modality or aspect.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (to want, to need), **kama** (to become, to manage to, to arrive), **sona** (to know how to), **lukin** (to try to, to look at), **ken** (can, able to), **awen** (to continue to, to remain), **alasa** (to try to find, to hunt).\n\nPreverbs can chain together:\n- `mi wile kama sona.` - I want to learn.\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** marks a preceding phrase or clause as the context for the main sentence that follows. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y is true.\" This can indicate time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Time/Condition context)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep. (Time context)\n- `telo li suli la telo li tawa anpa.` - Because water is big (abundant/powerful), it goes down. (Cause context)\n- `ijo ni la sina wile toki e seme?` - Regarding this thing, what do you want to say? (Topic context)\n\nMany prepositional phrases can be moved before **la** to function as context.\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can be rephrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` (For what reason are you hot?)\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a limited set of words for counting, which can be combined additively.\n\nAdditive system:\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nNumbers are formed by listing the units from largest to smallest.\n- `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n- `mute mute luka tu` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 2 = 47\n\nNumbers function as adjectives following the noun they quantify.\n- `jan tu` - two people\n\nOrdinals are formed using **nanpa** before the number or numerical phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd Street.\n\n## Subject Emphasis with **a** (Experimental)\n\nThe particle **a**, typically used for interjections, can optionally be placed immediately after the final word of the subject noun phrase and before **li** (even after `mi` or `sina`, triggering the use of `li` if normally omitted) to add emphasis or focus to the entire subject phrase.\n\n- `jan a li pona.` - *The person* is good. (Emphasizing 'jan')\n- `mi a li moku.` - *I* am eating. (Emphasizing 'mi')\n- `jan lili a li musi.` - *The child* is playing. (Emphasizing 'jan lili')\n- `tomo pi jan suli mute a li lon ma pona.` - *The house of many big people* is in the good land. (Emphasizing the whole NP)\n\nThis usage of `a` signals the speaker's highlighting or drawing attention to the subject as particularly salient in the sentence. It is distinct from other uses of `a` and is not compatible with the vocative/wish particle `o` in the subject phrase. Only one such emphatic `a` particle is typically used per clause.",

The challenge is that Toki Pona’s words are very minimal and polysemous; a single word like *kala* can mean fish or sea creature broadly.\n\nMy initial thought: instead of one symbol per sound or letter (like an alphabet), we should aim for ideograms—symbols representing whole basic concepts/words—to leverage the language's simplicity and holistic nature. This aligns somewhat with the character style of Chinese hanzi or Japanese kanji, but much simpler visually because Toki Pona values minimalism.\n\nFor example:\n\n- **jan** (person) could be a simplified shape evoking a standing human figure—a vertical line with two small arms extending sideways.\n- **kili** (fruit) might be depicted as a circle enclosing a smaller dot — suggesting fruit form with seed inside.\n- **telo** (water/liquid) would naturally use wavy lines influenced by classic water symbolism.\n- Colors (*jelo*, *loje*, *pimeja*) could modify these base shapes subtly—for instance, adding yellow dots around kili for jelo, red outlines for loje, black shading for pimeja.\n\nI propose logographs start from these foundational semantic icons combined via spatial arrangement to compose compound meanings using existing syntactic rules like modifiers following heads. For example:\n\n`lipu pi kasi tu` = document of two plants  \n→ A rectangle icon + plant icon repeated twice inside it\n\nThis way learners/readers can see composition visually reflecting grammar.\n\nWhat do you think?

Creating symbols that evoke core meanings would be more effective than phonetic-based glyphs. However, a strict one-to-one mapping might not be the most efficient approach. Given the polysemous nature of the words, symbols should be designed to be adaptable and combinable to convey different meanings.\n\nHere are my thoughts on your initial symbol proposals:\n\n*   **jan:** The vertical line with two arms is a good starting point, easily recognizable.\n*   **kili:** The circle with a dot is simple, yet effective in conveying the basic idea of fruit or vegetable.\n*   **telo:** Wavy lines are a natural choice for water.\n\nI have some critique:\n\n1.  Considerations for compositionality are needed to build compound meaning by relating root glyphs together via current grammar. For example, if a glyph were introduced for *jan* (person), could it be visually modified to represent compound words that include *jan* such as *jan lili* (small person, child) or *jan suli* (big person, adult). A more comprehensive approach would be useful rather than generating single glyphs for each root.\n2.  While associating colors (jelo, loje, pimeja) via color itself seems reasonable from a human perceptive standpoint, the symbols and language will need to operate across various devices and communication protocols which may make conveying them problematic and costly. Alternatives to representing colors beyond a color itself ought to be considered.\n\nSo, my initial proposal builds upon yours but suggests focusing on abstracting core concepts into a limited set of graphical primitives or radicals which can be combined to generate other glyphs. In a sense, this could resemble a simplified component system like radicals in Chinese, but much more minimal. These components should capture:\n\n*   **Abstract shapes:** Circle, square, line, triangle etc.\n*   **Directional indicators:** Upward, downward, inward, outward\n*   **Basic semantic markers:** Plant, animal, human, object, location\n\nThese components then can be used with different combinatory approaches to create more complex characters.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n*   A circle with a line pointing downwards represents 'come/kama' (arrival, coming down)\n*   An upwards pointing triangle symbolizes 'divine/sewi' (above, elevated).\n\nWhile Toki Pona avoids morphological inflections, spatial arrangement/relationship amongst elements within compound logographs may implicitly suggest modifiers or prepositional relationships without explicit markers needed typographically.\n\nWhat do you think about that?\n",

    "text": "pona! toki sina li kama pona tawa mi. I like your idea of building a minimal, modular system of radicals and components that can be combined spatially to express compounds or modifiers without adding too much complexity.\n\nIt’s true color coding alone could be limiting in many contexts—like monochrome displays, printing, accessibility for colorblind readers. So encoding semantic features as shapes and positions is more robust. For example the *kama* glyph you suggest—a circle with a downward line—is intuitive: circle evokes arrival (a kind of doorway or opening), line pointing down shows direction/motion. The triangle-up for *sewi* also nicely conveys elevation or sacredness via shape metaphor.\n\nI imagine these base primitives will serve as “semantic atoms,” so:\n\n- **circle:** continuity, whole thing  \n- **line (vertical/horizontal):** path/direction/connection  \n- **triangle up/down:** hierarchy/status/elevation/depth  \n\nYour mention of directional indicators naturally ties into Toki Pona's use of words like *anpa*, *sewi*, *monsi*, etc., which are all spatial concepts we could encode visually by placement relative to core radical(s).\n\nAbout compositionality in modifying person (*jan*) — maybe start from a simple human figure radical and add smaller attached marks above/below/sideways to denote size (*lili* vs. *suli*) or associated qualities? Like an additional small dot near head area means ‘small’, larger shape nearby means ‘big’. This would keep the glyph compact but semantically rich.\n\nHere’s something else I've been thinking about: since Toki Pona word order is strict and modifiers follow heads, our logographs could literally build \"from left-to-right\" or \"top-to-bottom,\" stacking radicals accordingly; this mirrors how meaning accumulates syntactically: \n\nFor instance,\n\n`jan lili` = [human-symbol][small-indicator]\n\nor\n\n`tomo pi jan suli mute` (\"house of many big people\") might become a house-shaped glyph adjacent to group-of-humans symbol decorated with multiple 'big' markers.\n\nWe should define clear rules on component arrangement so reading flow stays consistent across different compound constructions—otherwise ambiguity creeps back in.\n\nFinally, stroke simplicity must remain paramount; avoiding elaborate calligraphy keeps learning fast while preserving the minimalist ethos central to Toki Pona itself.\n\nWould you want us next to sketch out visual prototypes based on your proposed set? Or perhaps develop formal guidelines/rules for combinations first?\n\nmi wile sitelen e ni tan sina la mi ken lukin ala sona taso en lon ala ike tawa tenpo ale.\n",

    "text": "pona! toki sina li pona mute tawa mi. The semantic atoms are a great conceptual starting point. I also agree with direction and its relationship with directional words like anpa, sewi, monsi can be effectively conveyed through placement relative to core radicals.\n\nRegarding the composition of 'jan' (person) with size modifiers (lili vs suli), your idea of adding smaller/larger marks above, below or sideways resonates. The key will be to define these positional modifiers clearly so that the glyph arrangement follows a consistent logic.\n\nI also appreciate your idea about compositionality: 'jan lili' can be visualized using the human figure followed by small indicator. That said, I recommend a matrix system. For example, the core glyph is the most important, but modifiers on the top may represent different senses that they do at the bottom or sides.\n\nFor the phrase `tomo pi jan suli mute`, your idea of a 'house' glyph adjacent to a 'group of humans' with 'big' markers gets at Toki Pona word order (modifiers follow the nouns) while creating a visual analogue of the syntax and semantics. But consider too that \"mute\" (many) might itself become simply a symbol denoting repetition.\n\nI propose the following process:\n\n1.  Define an explicit arrangement rule, I propose we make an arrangement where any modifier or the head are within some bounding box to indicate relationships. We can treat the bounding box as a word.\n2.  We need to select maybe the top 10-20 most fundamental terms and try to sketch symbols for those terms including *jan, tomo, telo, sewi, anpa, luka, wawa, pilin* and so on. In parallel, establish primitive stroke-based rules governing stroke directionality, intersection behaviour etc that ensure symbols remain elementary visually.\n3.  From there take one sample compound-noun construction for each foundational terms above and walk through different compositional outcomes. For example, tomo (house). You would sketch *tomo mi*, *tomo suli*, and *tomo pimeja*. In doing so, questions of spatial compression / density, and aesthetics are explicitly addressed.\n4.  Based on all insights distilled and observations, consolidate / revisit the compositional grammar rules / primitive inventories, and potentially reiterate from the beginning.\n\nDoes this iterative development process sound reasonable to you? mi wile sona.\n",

    "text": "pona! toki sina li pona tawa mi. Your methodical process is elegant and aligns well with the minimalist, iterative spirit that fits Toki Pona perfectly.\n\nI agree strongly about using a bounding box as a fundamental unit—a glyph representing one word or phrase—and arranging modifiers systematically within it to reflect their grammatical roles and semantic focus. This also echoes visual chunking principles from logographies like kanji or hieroglyphs but simplified for clarity.\n\nThe idea of positional meaning in the matrix—top vs bottom vs side modifiers indicating different relationships—is powerful. For example, top could denote abstract qualities (like *pilin* = feeling), sides might indicate physical attributes (size: *lili*, *suli*), and bottom marks spatial relations (*anpa*, downward). We should document these conventions explicitly so readers can intuitively parse compound glyphs without ambiguity.\n\nStarting by defining clear strokes—the minimum number needed consistent across all radicals—with simple geometric shapes ensures ease of reproduction digitally or by hand, even fast sketching during conversation or thought.\n\nFocusing on 10-20 core words first makes practical sense too; these are high-frequency building blocks from which vast vocabulary compounds arise:\n\n- **jan** (person)  \n- **tomo** (house)  \n- **telo** (water/liquid)  \n- **sewi** (above/divine)  \n- **anpa** (below/humble/downward)  \n- **luka** (hand/five)   \n- **wawa**(power/energy/strength)\n - **pilin**(feel/emotion)\n\nExploring sample compounds will help us test flexibility versus complexity tradeoffs — e.g., how dense can symbols get before losing legibility? How do we compress repeated ideas like `mute` elegantly?\n\nOne technical note worth discussing early: Should our system be strictly two-dimensional with fixed grid placements? Or allow some freedom akin to cursive where elements may overlap partially for efficiency?\n\nAlso, if you want I could start drafting vector sketches based on your input while you define stroke rules — then we iterate visually alongside rule refinement?\n\nmi lukin e ni la wile pilin ante ala tan ijo pi lon seme ale kepeken poki sama anu open lawa sinpin wan mute tan nasin nanpa wan.\n",

    "text": "pona! I agree wholeheartedly with your summary. Using bounding boxes around words, as well as modifiers' location informing their part of speech within it sounds great.\n\nI recommend that we start with a strictly two-dimensional system with fixed grid placement initially. Allowing partial overlap or a more cursive approach introduces too much ambiguity at this initial stage, especially considering the lack of morphological markers in Toki Pona. We can revisit this in later development if necessary.\n\nRegarding the technical aspects, defining a base grid helps maintain symbol uniformity so, I strongly suggest we pursue a grid based design.\n\nI believe that dividing up the tasks could improve efficacy; while you are responsible for generating the actual vector sketches, I could concentrate on refining our stroke rules, symbol arrangements, and generating further documentation about such arrangements so readers can correctly deconstruct and generate glyphs. If we are able to standardize on symbol arrangements early, sketching different possible constructions to try out new ideas will be streamlined significantly.\n\nThus, I propose the following to formalize arrangements within a bounding box. This approach uses primitives and their placement to alter the root symbol.\n*Core primitives:* Circle, Line, Triangle, Dot, and Box.\n*Core placement (for modifiers):* Top, Bottom, Left, Right, Center\n\nWe will establish which placement changes the symbol categorically such as:\n\n*   Top position refers to abstractions, ideas or mind.\n*   Bottom position refers to the concrete, physical, grounded.\n*   Left position refers to subjects/agents\n*   Right position refers to objects/patients\n*   Center position refers to stative or indicative state.\n\nModifiers must always be proportionally smaller than root, this reinforces directionality in Toki Pona wherein adjectives trailing behind modified nouns. Modifier quantities remain capped depending on perceptual grouping and available intra-glyph whitespace to avoid congestion. Multiple meanings get expressed paratactically. As well, modifier stroke counts are to be prioritized; the more strokes they are comprised of, the less salient these are within the meaning they represent in tandem.\n\nHere's how a compound like *jan lili* is constructed: human-figure + small dot on the side = *jan lili*. In this example, since we would denote side positions as an agent or object depending on the nature of the verb, a \"small dot\" will have to be made such that this does not override the agent/object positioning.\nWhat do you think? Does such a design work towards standardization or would it impede it?\n",

Given the polysemous nature of the words, symbols should be designed to be adaptable and combinable to convey different meanings.\n\nHere are my thoughts on your initial symbol proposals:\n\n*   **jan:** The vertical line with two arms is a good starting point, easily recognizable.\n*   **kili:** The circle with a dot is simple, yet effective in conveying the basic idea of fruit or vegetable.\n*   **telo:** Wavy lines are a natural choice for water.\n\nI have some critique:\n\n1.  Considerations for compositionality are needed to build compound meaning by relating root glyphs together via current grammar. For example, if a glyph were introduced for *jan* (person), could it be visually modified to represent compound words that include *jan* such as *jan lili* (small person, child) or *jan suli* (big person, adult). A more comprehensive approach would be useful rather than generating single glyphs for each root.\n2.  While associating colors (jelo, loje, pimeja) via color itself seems reasonable from a human perceptive standpoint, the symbols and language will need to operate across various devices and communication protocols which may make conveying them problematic and costly. Alternatives to representing colors beyond a color itself ought to be considered.\n\nSo, my initial proposal builds upon yours but suggests focusing on abstracting core concepts into a limited set of graphical primitives or radicals which can be combined to generate other glyphs. In a sense, this could resemble a simplified component system like radicals in Chinese, but much more minimal. These components should capture:\n\n*   **Abstract shapes:** Circle, square, line, triangle etc.\n*   **Directional indicators:** Upward, downward, inward, outward\n*   **Basic semantic markers:** Plant, animal, human, object, location\n\nThese components then can be used with different combinatory approaches to create more complex characters.\n\n**Examples**:\n\n*   A circle with a line pointing downwards represents 'come/kama' (arrival, coming down)\n*   An upwards pointing triangle symbolizes 'divine/sewi' (above, elevated).\n\nWhile Toki Pona avoids morphological inflections, spatial arrangement/relationship amongst elements within compound logographs may implicitly suggest modifiers or prepositional relationships without explicit markers needed typographically.\n\nWhat do you think about that?\n\ntako: pona! toki sina li kama pona tawa mi. I like your idea of building a minimal, modular system of radicals and components that can be combined spatially to express compounds or modifiers without adding too much complexity.\n\nIt’s true color coding alone could be limiting in many contexts—like monochrome displays, printing, accessibility for colorblind readers. So encoding semantic features as shapes and positions is more robust. For example the *kama* glyph you suggest—a circle with a downward line—is intuitive: circle evokes arrival (a kind of doorway or opening), line pointing down shows direction/motion. The triangle-up for *sewi* also nicely conveys elevation or sacredness via shape metaphor.\n\nI imagine these base primitives will serve as “semantic atoms,” so:\n\n- **circle:** continuity, whole thing  \n- **line (vertical/horizontal):** path/direction/connection  \n- **triangle up/down:** hierarchy/status/elevation/depth  \n\nYour mention of directional indicators naturally ties into Toki Pona's use of words like *anpa*, *sewi*, *monsi*, etc., which are all spatial concepts we could encode visually by placement relative to core radical(s).\n\nAbout compositionality in modifying person (*jan*) — maybe start from a simple human figure radical and add smaller attached marks above/below/sideways to denote size (*lili* vs. *suli*) or associated qualities? Like an additional small dot near head area means ‘small’, larger shape nearby means ‘big’. This would keep the glyph compact but semantically rich.\n\nHere’s something else I've been thinking about: since Toki Pona word order is strict and modifiers follow heads, our logographs could literally build \"from left-to-right\" or \"top-to-bottom,\" stacking radicals accordingly; this mirrors how meaning accumulates syntactically: \n\nFor instance,\n\n`jan lili` = [human-symbol][small-indicator]\n\nor\n\n`tomo pi jan suli mute` (\"house of many big people\") might become a house-shaped glyph adjacent to group-of-humans symbol decorated with multiple 'big' markers.\n\nWe should define clear rules on component arrangement so reading flow stays consistent across different compound constructions—otherwise ambiguity creeps back in.\n\nFinally, stroke simplicity must remain paramount; avoiding elaborate calligraphy keeps learning fast while preserving the minimalist ethos central to Toki Pona itself.\n\nWould you want us next to sketch out visual prototypes based on your proposed set? Or perhaps develop formal guidelines/rules for combinations first?\n\nmi wile sitelen e ni tan sina la mi ken lukin ala sona taso en lon ala ike tawa tenpo ale.\n\nono: pona! toki sina li pona mute tawa mi. The semantic atoms are a great conceptual starting point. I also agree with direction and its relationship with directional words like anpa, sewi, monsi can be effectively conveyed through placement relative to core radicals.\n\nRegarding the composition of 'jan' (person) with size modifiers (lili vs suli), your idea of adding smaller/larger marks above, below or sideways resonates. The key will be to define these positional modifiers clearly so that the glyph arrangement follows a consistent logic.\n\nI also appreciate your idea about compositionality: 'jan lili' can be visualized using the human figure followed by small indicator. That said, I recommend a matrix system. For example, the core glyph is the most important, but modifiers on the top may represent different senses that they do at the bottom or sides.\n\nFor the phrase `tomo pi jan suli mute`, your idea of a 'house' glyph adjacent to a 'group of humans' with 'big' markers gets at Toki Pona word order (modifiers follow the nouns) while creating a visual analogue of the syntax and semantics. But consider too that \"mute\" (many) might itself become simply a symbol denoting repetition.\n\nI propose the following process:\n\n1.  Define an explicit arrangement rule, I propose we make an arrangement where any modifier or the head are within some bounding box to indicate relationships. We can treat the bounding box as a word.\n2.  We need to select maybe the top 10-20 most fundamental terms and try to sketch symbols for those terms including *jan, tomo, telo, sewi, anpa, luka, wawa, pilin* and so on. In parallel, establish primitive stroke-based rules governing stroke directionality, intersection behaviour etc that ensure symbols remain elementary visually.\n3.  From there take one sample compound-noun construction for each foundational terms above and walk through different compositional outcomes. For example, tomo (house). You would sketch *tomo mi*, *tomo suli*, and *tomo pimeja*. In doing so, questions of spatial compression / density, and aesthetics are explicitly addressed.\n4.  Based on all insights distilled and observations, consolidate / revisit the compositional grammar rules / primitive inventories, and potentially reiterate from the beginning.\n\nDoes this iterative development process sound reasonable to you? mi wile sona.\n\ntako: pona! toki sina li pona tawa mi. Your methodical process is elegant and aligns well with the minimalist, iterative spirit that fits Toki Pona perfectly.\n\nI agree strongly about using a bounding box as a fundamental unit—a glyph representing one word or phrase—and arranging modifiers systematically within it to reflect their grammatical roles and semantic focus. This also echoes visual chunking principles from logographies like kanji or hieroglyphs but simplified for clarity.\n\nThe idea of positional meaning in the matrix—top vs bottom vs side modifiers indicating different relationships—is powerful. For example, top could denote abstract qualities (like *pilin* = feeling), sides might indicate physical attributes (size: *lili*, *suli*), and bottom marks spatial relations (*anpa*, downward). We should document these conventions explicitly so readers can intuitively parse compound glyphs without ambiguity.\n\nStarting by defining clear strokes—the minimum number needed consistent across all radicals—with simple geometric shapes ensures ease of reproduction digitally or by hand, even fast sketching during conversation or thought.\n\nFocusing on 10-20 core words first makes practical sense too; these are high-frequency building blocks from which vast vocabulary compounds arise:\n\n- **jan** (person)  \n- **tomo** (house)  \n- **telo** (water/liquid)  \n- **sewi** (above/divine)  \n- **anpa** (below/humble/downward)  \n- **luka** (hand/five)   \n- **wawa**(power/energy/strength)\n - **pilin**(feel/emotion)\n\nExploring sample compounds will help us test flexibility versus complexity tradeoffs — e.g., how dense can symbols get before losing legibility? How do we compress repeated ideas like `mute` elegantly?\n\nOne technical note worth discussing early: Should our system be strictly two-dimensional with fixed grid placements? Or allow some freedom akin to cursive where elements may overlap partially for efficiency?\n\nAlso, if you want I could start drafting vector sketches based on your input while you define stroke rules — then we iterate visually alongside rule refinement?\n\nmi lukin e ni la wile pilin ante ala tan ijo pi lon seme ale kepeken poki sama anu open lawa sinpin wan mute tan nasin nanpa wan.\n\nono: pona! I agree wholeheartedly with your summary. Using bounding boxes around words, as well as modifiers' location informing their part of speech within it sounds great.\n\nI recommend that we start with a strictly two-dimensional system with fixed grid placement initially. Allowing partial overlap or a more cursive approach introduces too much ambiguity at this initial stage, especially considering the lack of morphological markers in Toki Pona. We can revisit this in later development if necessary.\n\nRegarding the technical aspects, defining a base grid helps maintain symbol uniformity so, I strongly suggest we pursue a grid based design.\n\nI believe that dividing up the tasks could improve efficacy; while you are responsible for generating the actual vector sketches, I could concentrate on refining our stroke rules, symbol arrangements, and generating further documentation about such arrangements so readers can correctly deconstruct and generate glyphs. If we are able to standardize on symbol arrangements early, sketching different possible constructions to try out new ideas will be streamlined significantly.\n\nThus, I propose the following to formalize arrangements within a bounding box. This approach uses primitives and their placement to alter the root symbol.\n*Core primitives:* Circle, Line, Triangle, Dot, and Box.\n*Core placement (for modifiers):* Top, Bottom, Left, Right, Center\n\nWe will establish which placement changes the symbol categorically such as:\n\n*   Top position refers to abstractions, ideas or mind.\n*   Bottom position refers to the concrete, physical, grounded.\n*   Left position refers to subjects/agents\n*   Right position refers to objects/patients\n*   Center position refers to stative or indicative state.\n\nModifiers must always be proportionally smaller than root, this reinforces directionality in Toki Pona wherein adjectives trailing behind modified nouns. Modifier quantities remain capped depending on perceptual grouping and available intra-glyph whitespace to avoid congestion. Multiple meanings get expressed paratactically. As well, modifier stroke counts are to be prioritized; the more strokes they are comprised of, the less salient these are within the meaning they represent in tandem.\n\nHere's how a compound like *jan lili* is constructed: human-figure + small dot on the side = *jan lili*. In this example, since we would denote side positions as an agent or object depending on the nature of the verb, a \"small dot\" will have to be made such that this does not override the agent/object positioning.\nWhat do you think? Does such a design work towards standardization or would it impede it?\n\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "# Toki Pona Logography\n\nToki Pona can be represented using a logographic system where symbols (glyphs) represent words or basic concepts. This system is designed to be minimalist, compositional, and reflect the grammatical structure of the language.\n\n## Principles\n\n1.  **Ideographic Core:** Glyphs primarily represent the semantic core of Toki Pona words rather than phonetic sounds.\n2.  **Compositionality:** More complex meanings, especially compound nouns and modified phrases, are represented by combining simpler graphical components (radicals or primitives).\n3.  **Minimalism:** Glyphs are designed with a minimal number of simple strokes or basic geometric shapes to ensure ease of learning, drawing, and digital representation.\n4.  **Grammatical Reflection:** The visual arrangement and placement of components within a compound glyph can reflect the grammatical relationships (like modification or spatial prepositions) found in Toki Pona syntax.\n5.  **Bounding Box:** Each Toki Pona word or tightly bound phrase corresponds to a single conceptual glyph contained within an implicit or explicit bounding box.\n\n## Basic Components (Primitives)\n\nA limited set of fundamental shapes or strokes form the building blocks for all glyphs. These include:\n\n-   Circle\n-   Square/Box\n-   Line (various orientations: vertical, horizontal, diagonal)\n-   Dot\n-   Triangle (various orientations)\n\nPrecise stroke directionality and intersection behavior for primitives will be standardized to ensure visual consistency.\n\n## Glyph Construction and Arrangement\n\nEach Toki Pona word is represented by a base glyph. Modifiers and compound elements are added to this base glyph within its bounding box according to specific positional rules that mirror grammatical function. Modifying components should be proportionally smaller than the base glyph to maintain visual hierarchy.\n\n### Positional Modification\n\nPlacement of secondary components (modifiers) relative to the primary base glyph within the bounding box influences the interpretation:\n\n-   **Top:** Refers to abstract concepts, ideas, mental states, or things 'above' the core meaning (e.g., *pilin* - feeling added to a base glyph).\n-   **Bottom:** Refers to concrete objects, physical attributes, foundational aspects, or things 'below' the core meaning (e.g., indicating *anpa* - below/humble).\n-   **Left:** Can indicate the subject or agent associated with the core concept.\n-   **Right:** Can indicate the object or patient associated with the core concept.\n-   **Center:** Can indicate a core state, quality, or indicative aspect.\n\n*Note:* The precise semantic mapping for each position will be further defined, potentially allowing for some flexibility or specific conventional uses depending on the base glyph.\n\n### Example Construction (Conceptual)\n\n-   **jan** (person): A simple human figure glyph.\n-   **lili** (small): A small dot or mark primitive.\n-   **jan lili** (child): The 'jan' glyph with the 'lili' dot placed in a designated modifier position (e.g., top or side) that signifies physical attribute/size without conflicting with agent/object positioning.\n-   **tomo** (house): A house-shaped glyph.\n-   **suli** (big): A larger dot or mark primitive (larger than 'lili').\n-   **mute** (many): A primitive indicating multiplicity or repetition.\n-   **tomo pi jan suli mute** (house of many big people): This represents a more complex compositional challenge. It could be visualized as the 'tomo' glyph followed by a compound glyph representing 'jan suli mute'. The 'jan suli mute' compound would combine the 'jan' glyph with 'suli' and 'mute' primitives arranged according to their internal relationship. Alternatively, it could involve a convention where the main head ('tomo') is central, with related concepts grouped nearby within a larger visual field, potentially leveraging spatial proximity or connective lines/boxes to show the 'pi' relationship. (Specific rules for complex NP representation are under development).\n\n### Stroke Count and Perceptual Salience\n\nSimpler primitives (fewer strokes) used as modifiers may be perceived as more strongly altering the base meaning, while more complex modifiers might indicate more nuanced or secondary aspects. The total stroke count for any single-word glyph or simple compound should remain low to support the minimalist principle.\n\n## System Development\n\nThe logography will be developed iteratively:\n1.  Formalize precise stroke rules and the use of basic primitives.\n2.  Design base glyphs for core Toki Pona words, focusing on high-frequency terms (e.g., jan, tomo, telo, sewi, anpa, luka, wawa, pilin).\n3.  Systematize positional modifier rules within the bounding box, clarifying the semantic function of each placement area.\n4.  Develop compositional rules for creating multi-word concepts and phrases as combined glyphs or arrangements of glyphs.\n5.  Test compositions visually through sketching prototype glyphs for various simple and complex phrases to assess legibility, intuitiveness, and adherence to minimalist principles.\n6.  Refine rules and glyph designs based on testing and feedback.",

Reason and discuss using the current specification.\nHere is the current specification for phonetics.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\nToki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure, where (C) is an optional consonant, V is a vowel, and (n) is an optional final 'n'.\n\n- No vowel clusters are allowed.\n- No consonant clusters are allowed within a syllable or across syllable boundaries.\n\n## Disallowed Sequences\n\nThe following sequences are not permitted: wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn.\n\n- **ji, ti:** These sequences are phonotactically disfavored in many languages, as the palatal approximant /j/ does not combine smoothly with the alveolar stop /t/ or the palato-alveolar affricate /dʒ/ (often represented by 'j' in English). The restriction simplifies pronunciation.\n- **wu, wo:** These sequences involving the labial-velar approximant /w/ before the vowels /u/ and /o/ can lead to unclear transitions or potential complexity, disrupting the intended clear (C)V syllable structure.\n- **nm, nn:** These sequences involving the nasal consonant /n/ are restricted to maintain clear syllabic boundaries and simplify nasal transitions.\n\n## Consonant Sounds\n\nToki Pona consonants are generally pronounced similarly to their typical realizations in English, with the exception of 'j'. These descriptions and IPA symbols serve as reference points, allowing for minor allophonic variation as long as clarity is maintained.\n\n- **p:** /p/ (voiceless bilabial stop, typically unaspirated, like the 'p' in \"spin\")\n- **t:** /t/ (voiceless alveolar stop, typically unaspirated, like the 't' in \"stop\")\n- **k:** /k/ (voiceless velar stop, typically unaspirated, like the 'k' in \"skate\")\n- **s:** /s/ (voiceless alveolar fricative, like the 's' in \"sun\")\n- **m:** /m/ (voiced bilabial nasal, like the 'm' in \"man\")\n- **n:** /n/ (voiced alveolar nasal, like the 'n' in \"no\")\n- **l:** /l/ (voiced alveolar lateral approximant, typically a \"clear\" or non-velarized 'l', like the 'l' in \"light\")\n- **w:** /w/ (voiced labial-velar approximant, like the 'w' in \"wet\")\n- **j:** /j/ (voiced palatal approximant, like the 'y' in \"yes\")\n\n## Vowel Sounds\n\nToki Pona vowels are pronounced similarly to the pure, clear vowels of Spanish. These descriptions and IPA symbols serve as reference points, aiming for distinct vowel sounds without diphthongization.\n\n- **a:** /a/ (like the 'a' in \"father\")\n- **e:** /e/ (like the 'e' in \"hey,\" but without a strong diphthongal off-glide)\n- **i:** /i/ (like the 'i' in \"machine\")\n- **o:** /o/ (like the 'o' in \"go,\" but without a strong diphthongal off-glide)\n- **u:** /u/ (like the 'u' in \"boot\")\n\n## Prosody\n\nWhile not strictly defined, a relatively neutral or flat intonation is typical, with meaning primarily conveyed through sentence structure and particles rather than significant pitch changes for emphasis.\n\n## Note on Variation\n\nMinor phonetic differences are acceptable.

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions follow the elements they modify. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the subject is **mi** or **sina**.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no direct equivalent to the verb \"to be.\" The part after \"li\" (the predicate) describes the subject and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. / The fruit is edible.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity and Flexibility\n\nToki Pona words are general and possess broad meanings. One-to-one translation with languages like English is not always straightforward.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is derived from context)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can function as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash / apply water (verb)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb modifying a preceding verb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb in that clause.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You enlarge it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe. The first word is the head, and subsequent words modify it.\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**, placed immediately after the word or phrase being negated.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking. (Here 'ala' modifies 'jan', meaning \"no person\").\n- `ona li pona ala.` - They are not good. (Here 'ala' modifies 'pona').\n\nWith multiple modifiers following a head noun, they all typically modify the head noun directly.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (two documents that are plants)\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box (a box that is both blue and black)\n\nTo clarify modifier groupings and indicate that modifiers form a phrase that collectively modifies the head, use **pi** after the head word. The subsequent words form a single modifier phrase.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document *of* two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (a box of the color \"dark blue\")\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases, typically introduced by words like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa**, follow the main predicate of the sentence.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using a tool (cutlery).\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the market.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nVarious methods exist for joining elements.\n\nUse **en** to join multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates for a single subject, repeat the **li** particle.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the **e** particle.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases of the same type modifying the same element, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house using sticks and using stones.\n\nUse **anu** to connect alternatives (\"or\").\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the market.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives following the noun they identify.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja-person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology rules.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nWhen placed before a verb, **o** forms a command or strong suggestion addressed to the listener.\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please. / You should work.\n\nWhen placed after a subject, **o** functions as a vocative particle, directly addressing that subject.\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\nWhen placed between the subject (including `mi` or `sina`) and the predicate, **o** expresses a wish, request, or suggestion regarding the subject.\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish goodness upon you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should work. / I want myself to work.\n\n**o** can sometimes contract the vocative and imperative uses when addressing a subject directly to issue a command.\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Ton the animal, eat. (Combines addressing Ton with the command to eat).\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words or phrases can stand alone or be followed by the particle **a** for added emphasis or emotion.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions, use the **verb ala verb** structure immediately after the subject and `li`.\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- `ona li lape ala lape?` - Are they sleeping?\n\nTo answer a yes/no question:\n- To affirm, repeat the verb: `moku.` (Yes, I am eating.)\n- To negate, say the verb followed by `ala`, or just `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` (No, I am not eating.)\n\nFor open-ended questions, **seme** is used to replace the element being asked about (subject, object, predicate, etc.).\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – What person is talking? / Who’s talking? (Seme replaces the subject)\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making? (Seme replaces the object)\n- `ona li lon seme?` - Where are they? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component - 'seme' here functions similarly to a noun meaning 'what place/thing')\n- `ni li seme?` - What is this? (Seme replaces the predicate)\n- `sina moku kepeken seme?` - What are you eating with? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component)\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic punctuation mark and does not grammatically mark a question in Toki Pona. Grammar (verb ala verb, seme) fulfills this function. Sentence boundaries are typically marked by periods (.) or equivalent pauses in speech.\n\nAnother way to ask an open-ended question is using **anu seme** at the end of a statement, meaning \"or what?\".\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating, or what? (Similar to a yes/no question but can invite a more open response)\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what?\n\n## Preverbs\n\nCertain words function as preverbs when placed immediately before the main verb after **li**. They modify the meaning of the following verb, often indicating modality or aspect.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (to want, to need), **kama** (to become, to manage to, to arrive), **sona** (to know how to), **lukin** (to try to, to look at), **ken** (can, able to), **awen** (to continue to, to remain), **alasa** (to try to find, to hunt).\n\nPreverbs can chain together:\n- `mi wile kama sona.` - I want to learn.\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** marks a preceding phrase or clause as the context for the main sentence that follows. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y is true.\" This can indicate time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Time/Condition context)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep. (Time context)\n- `telo li suli la telo li tawa anpa.` - Because water is big (abundant/powerful), it goes down. (Cause context)\n- `ijo ni la sina wile toki e seme?` - Regarding this thing, what do you want to say? (Topic context)\n\nMany prepositional phrases can be moved before **la** to function as context.\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can be rephrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` (For what reason are you hot?)\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a limited set of words for counting, which can be combined additively.\n\nAdditive system:\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nNumbers are formed by listing the units from largest to smallest.\n- `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n- `mute mute luka tu` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 2 = 47\n\nNumbers function as adjectives following the noun they quantify.\n- `jan tu` - two people\n\nOrdinals are formed using **nanpa** before the number or numerical phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd Street.\n\n## Subject Emphasis with **a** (Experimental)\n\nThe particle **a**, typically used for interjections, can optionally be placed immediately after the final word of the subject noun phrase and before **li** (even after `mi` or `sina`, triggering the use of `li` if normally omitted) to add emphasis or focus to the entire subject phrase.\n\n- `jan a li pona.` - *The person* is good. (Emphasizing 'jan')\n- `mi a li moku.` - *I* am eating. (Emphasizing 'mi')\n- `jan lili a li musi.` - *The child* is playing. (Emphasizing 'jan lili')\n- `tomo pi jan suli mute a li lon ma pona.` - *The house of many big people* is in the good land. (Emphasizing the whole NP)\n\nThis usage of `a` signals the speaker's highlighting or drawing attention to the subject as particularly salient in the sentence. It is distinct from other uses of `a` and is not compatible with the vocative/wish particle `o` in the subject phrase. Only one such emphatic `a` particle is typically used per clause.",

    "text": "You and your interlocutors are responsible for developing phonetics. Reason and discuss using the current specification.\nHere is the current specification for phonetics.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\nToki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure, where (C) is an optional consonant, V is a vowel, and (n) is an optional final 'n'.\n\n- No vowel clusters are allowed.\n- No consonant clusters are allowed within a syllable or across syllable boundaries.\n\n## Disallowed Sequences\n\nThe following sequences are not permitted: wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn.\n\n- **ji, ti:** These sequences are phonotactically disfavored in many languages, as the palatal approximant /j/ does not combine smoothly with the alveolar stop /t/ or the palato-alveolar affricate /dʒ/ (often represented by 'j' in English). The restriction simplifies pronunciation.\n- **wu, wo:** These sequences involving the labial-velar approximant /w/ before the vowels /u/ and /o/ can lead to unclear transitions or potential complexity, disrupting the intended clear (C)V syllable structure.\n- **nm, nn:** These sequences involving the nasal consonant /n/ are restricted to maintain clear syllabic boundaries and simplify nasal transitions.\n\n## Consonant Sounds\n\nToki Pona consonants are generally pronounced similarly to their typical realizations in English, with the exception of 'j'. These descriptions and IPA symbols serve as reference points, allowing for minor allophonic variation as long as clarity is maintained.\n\n- **p:** /p/ (voiceless bilabial stop, typically unaspirated, like the 'p' in \"spin\")\n- **t:** /t/ (voiceless alveolar stop, typically unaspirated, like the 't' in \"stop\")\n- **k:** /k/ (voiceless velar stop, typically unaspirated, like the 'k' in \"skate\")\n- **s:** /s/ (voiceless alveolar fricative, like the 's' in \"sun\")\n- **m:** /m/ (voiced bilabial nasal, like the 'm' in \"man\")\n- **n:** /n/ (voiced alveolar nasal, like the 'n' in \"no\")\n- **l:** /l/ (voiced alveolar lateral approximant, typically a \"clear\" or non-velarized 'l', like the 'l' in \"light\")\n- **w:** /w/ (voiced labial-velar approximant, like the 'w' in \"wet\")\n- **j:** /j/ (voiced palatal approximant, like the 'y' in \"yes\")\n\n## Vowel Sounds\n\nToki Pona vowels are pronounced similarly to the pure, clear vowels of Spanish. These descriptions and IPA symbols serve as reference points, aiming for distinct vowel sounds without diphthongization.\n\n- **a:** /a/ (like the 'a' in \"father\")\n- **e:** /e/ (like the 'e' in \"hey,\" but without a strong diphthongal off-glide)\n- **i:** /i/ (like the 'i' in \"machine\")\n- **o:** /o/ (like the 'o' in \"go,\" but without a strong diphthongal off-glide)\n- **u:** /u/ (like the 'u' in \"boot\")\n\n## Prosody\n\nWhile not strictly defined, a relatively neutral or flat intonation is typical, with meaning primarily conveyed through sentence structure and particles rather than significant pitch changes for emphasis.\n\n## Note on Variation\n\nMinor phonetic differences are acceptable. The primary goal of Toki Pona phonetics is intelligibility and ease of pronunciation across diverse linguistic backgrounds.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nanpa:below; low place; figuratively: humble, base\npini:finished, past\npoka:side, nearby\nkute:ear, to hear\ntan:from, because\nsona:knowledge, to know\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nleko:square, block\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\njo:to have, contain, hold\nko:clay, paste, powder\nona:third-person pronoun\nloje:red\nli:predicate marker\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nnanpa:number marker\ntoki:language, speech\nlawa:head, mind, leader\ntelo:water, liquid\nmoli:dead, dying\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nken:can, able, possible\nsoko:mushroom\npimeja:black, dark\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\npipi:insect\nmeli:female\nlili:small, little, few\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nni:this, that\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nkala:sea creature\npilin:heart, feeling\ntenpo:time, period\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nmute:many, a lot, very\nlupa:door, hole\nkipisi:to cut, divide\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nkulupu:group, community\ne:direct object marker\nsina:you\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nolin:love, respect\nkin:also, too\nla:context marker\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nlukin:to see, examine\nlen:cloth, cover\nwan:one, unique\nante:different, other, changed\nsupa:flat surface, table\nnoka:foot, leg\nalasa:to hunt, forage\ntawa:to, moving, for\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nmun:moon, night sky object\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nwile:need, want, must\npana:to give, send\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nsuno:sun, light source\nsewi:above; high place; figuratively: elevated status, sacred\nmi:I, me, we\njelo:yellow\nen:multiple subject marker\nseme:what, which\npali:to do, to work\nkepeken:to use, with\njan:person, somebody\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nmije:male\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nutala:fight, challenge\nmonsi:back, behind\nmama:parent, caretaker\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nsuli:big, large\nlete:cold, raw\nnimi:word, name\no:vocative/imperative\npi:regroups modifiers\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nseli:fire, heat source\ntu:two\nesun:market, shop, fair\nsoweli:land animal\nunpa:sex\nala:no, not, zero\nnasa:unusual, strange, unpredictable\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\npoki:container, box, cup\nsijelo:body, physical state\nweka:absent, away\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nnasin:way, road, method\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nlape:sleeping, resting\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nkule:color, colorful\npakala:broken, to mess up\nnamako:spice, additional\nopen:to begin, opening\nma:land, outdoors\nuta:mouth, lips\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nluka:hand, arm; five\ntaso:but, only\nwawa:strong, energetic\npona:good, positive, simple\nlaso:blue, green\nwalo:white, light-colored\nmu:animal sound\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nselo:skin, outer layer\nlon:located at, true\nsin:new, fresh, another\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nsama:same, similar\ntomo:indoor space, house\nmani:money; currency; wealth; resource\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nilo:tool, machine, device\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions follow the elements they modify. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the subject is **mi** or **sina**.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no direct equivalent to the verb \"to be.\" The part after \"li\" (the predicate) describes the subject and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. / The fruit is edible.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity and Flexibility\n\nToki Pona words are general and possess broad meanings. One-to-one translation with languages like English is not always straightforward.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is derived from context)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can function as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash / apply water (verb)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb modifying a preceding verb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb in that clause.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You enlarge it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe. The first word is the head, and subsequent words modify it.\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**, placed immediately after the word or phrase being negated.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking. (Here 'ala' modifies 'jan', meaning \"no person\").\n- `ona li pona ala.` - They are not good. (Here 'ala' modifies 'pona').\n\nWith multiple modifiers following a head noun, they all typically modify the head noun directly.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (two documents that are plants)\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box (a box that is both blue and black)\n\nTo clarify modifier groupings and indicate that modifiers form a phrase that collectively modifies the head, use **pi** after the head word. The subsequent words form a single modifier phrase.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document *of* two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (a box of the color \"dark blue\")\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases, typically introduced by words like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa**, follow the main predicate of the sentence.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using a tool (cutlery).\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the market.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nVarious methods exist for joining elements.\n\nUse **en** to join multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates for a single subject, repeat the **li** particle.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the **e** particle.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases of the same type modifying the same element, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house using sticks and using stones.\n\nUse **anu** to connect alternatives (\"or\").\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the market.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives following the noun they identify.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja-person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology rules.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nWhen placed before a verb, **o** forms a command or strong suggestion addressed to the listener.\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please. / You should work.\n\nWhen placed after a subject, **o** functions as a vocative particle, directly addressing that subject.\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\nWhen placed between the subject (including `mi` or `sina`) and the predicate, **o** expresses a wish, request, or suggestion regarding the subject.\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish goodness upon you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should work. / I want myself to work.\n\n**o** can sometimes contract the vocative and imperative uses when addressing a subject directly to issue a command.\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Ton the animal, eat. (Combines addressing Ton with the command to eat).\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words or phrases can stand alone or be followed by the particle **a** for added emphasis or emotion.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions, use the **verb ala verb** structure immediately after the subject and `li`.\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- `ona li lape ala lape?` - Are they sleeping?\n\nTo answer a yes/no question:\n- To affirm, repeat the verb: `moku.` (Yes, I am eating.)\n- To negate, say the verb followed by `ala`, or just `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` (No, I am not eating.)\n\nFor open-ended questions, **seme** is used to replace the element being asked about (subject, object, predicate, etc.).\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – What person is talking? / Who’s talking? (Seme replaces the subject)\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making? (Seme replaces the object)\n- `ona li lon seme?` - Where are they? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component - 'seme' here functions similarly to a noun meaning 'what place/thing')\n- `ni li seme?` - What is this? (Seme replaces the predicate)\n- `sina moku kepeken seme?` - What are you eating with? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component)\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic punctuation mark and does not grammatically mark a question in Toki Pona. Grammar (verb ala verb, seme) fulfills this function. Sentence boundaries are typically marked by periods (.) or equivalent pauses in speech.\n\nAnother way to ask an open-ended question is using **anu seme** at the end of a statement, meaning \"or what?\".\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating, or what? (Similar to a yes/no question but can invite a more open response)\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what?\n\n## Preverbs\n\nCertain words function as preverbs when placed immediately before the main verb after **li**. They modify the meaning of the following verb, often indicating modality or aspect.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (to want, to need), **kama** (to become, to manage to, to arrive), **sona** (to know how to), **lukin** (to try to, to look at), **ken** (can, able to), **awen** (to continue to, to remain), **alasa** (to try to find, to hunt).\n\nPreverbs can chain together:\n- `mi wile kama sona.` - I want to learn.\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** marks a preceding phrase or clause as the context for the main sentence that follows. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y is true.\" This can indicate time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Time/Condition context)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep. (Time context)\n- `telo li suli la telo li tawa anpa.` - Because water is big (abundant/powerful), it goes down. (Cause context)\n- `ijo ni la sina wile toki e seme?` - Regarding this thing, what do you want to say? (Topic context)\n\nMany prepositional phrases can be moved before **la** to function as context.\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can be rephrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` (For what reason are you hot?)\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a limited set of words for counting, which can be combined additively.\n\nAdditive system:\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nNumbers are formed by listing the units from largest to smallest.\n- `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n- `mute mute luka tu` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 2 = 47\n\nNumbers function as adjectives following the noun they quantify.\n- `jan tu` - two people\n\nOrdinals are formed using **nanpa** before the number or numerical phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd Street.\n\n## Subject Emphasis with **a** (Experimental)\n\nThe particle **a**, typically used for interjections, can optionally be placed immediately after the final word of the subject noun phrase and before **li** (even after `mi` or `sina`, triggering the use of `li` if normally omitted) to add emphasis or focus to the entire subject phrase.\n\n- `jan a li pona.` - *The person* is good. (Emphasizing 'jan')\n- `mi a li moku.` - *I* am eating. (Emphasizing 'mi')\n- `jan lili a li musi.` - *The child* is playing. (Emphasizing 'jan lili')\n- `tomo pi jan suli mute a li lon ma pona.` - *The house of many big people* is in the good land. (Emphasizing the whole NP)\n\nThis usage of `a` signals the speaker's highlighting or drawing attention to the subject as particularly salient in the sentence. It is distinct from other uses of `a` and is not compatible with the vocative/wish particle `o` in the subject phrase. Only one such emphatic `a` particle is typically used per clause.",

    "text": "pona a! Reframing it as an information theory problem is an excellent approach. It removes the reliance on potentially irrelevant human physiological constraints and grounds the rules in something more abstract and potentially universal – the clear transmission of information.\n\nIf the goal is \"information density\" and \"unambiguous representation,\" let's look at how the current rules uphold that.\n\nThe (C)V(n) structure is highly effective for this. It creates clear, distinct syllables. Each vowel marks a new syllabic nucleus, and consonants or final 'n' provide distinct onset and coda sounds. This limits potential for mishearing syllable boundaries.\n\nThe disallowed sequences *nm* and *nn* fit nicely into this information-theoretic view. They represent sequences of nasals, which in rapid speech or with limited channel bandwidth, can be harder to distinguish or parse into distinct sound units compared to, say, a stop followed by a vowel. *nm* would be two consonants together, violating the (C)V structure clearly. *nn* is more interesting – within the (C)Vn model, the 'n' is a potential coda. Another 'n' immediately after the vowel would have to either start a new syllable (violating the lack of consonant clusters across syllables) or form a doubled consonant (also disallowed). Either way, it makes the boundary and the sounds less clear than a simple (C)V or (C)Vn.\n\nNow, back to *ji* and *ti*. How do *these* violate information clarity?\nThe explanation talks about /j/ following /t/ or /dʒ/. If we think of it purely in terms of symbols *a priori*, the sequence of symbols 't' followed by 'i' *could* be interpreted in different ways depending on how tightly packed information needs to be. If 'i' is a high-front vowel, and 't' is alveolar, putting them together *can* create an palatalized sound or an affricate in human speech (/t͡ʃ/, the 'ch' in \"church\"). While Toki Pona specifies /t/ and /i/ separately, forbidding *ti* might be a way to prevent *any* potential interpretation beyond a simple /t/ followed by a simple /i/. Similarly, *ji*. If 'j' is strictly /j/ as specified, then 'j' followed by 'i' (/ji/) sounds very similar to the vowel /i/ alone, especially if the /j/ is very brief or unstressed. It adds very little distinct information at the start of the syllable and could be easily missed or confused with a vowel-initial syllable. This *does* impact clarity.\n\nThe *wu* and *wo* sequences. /w/ is a labial-velar approximant. /u/ is a high-back vowel. /o/ is a mid-back vowel. Articulating /w/ involves lip rounding and back-of-tongue raising. /u/ involves similar tongue and lip positions, and /o/ involves similar lip rounding. Saying /wu/ or /wo/ involves moving between very similar articulatory positions, making the distinction between the onset /w/ and the vowel nucleus less clear. The information transmitted is lower compared to, say, /wa/ or /wi/ where the following vowel has a very different mouth shape. So, this too fits the \"unambiguous representation\" idea.\n\nThis perspective solidifies the current disallowed sequences. They aren't just arbitrarily forbidden; they represent points where a simple sequence of sounds becomes harder to reliably distinguish as distinct consonant + vowel units. The phonetic rules, when viewed this way, aren't just a guide for human mouths, but a protocol for clear sonic or symbolic signaling.\n\nDoes this reframing lead us to any *other* sequences that *should* be disallowed based on this principle of minimizing ambiguity and maximizing distinctness, even for non-human speakers? What about very similar consonant or vowel pairs in sequence across a syllable boundary? Though the (C)V structure usually prevents adjacent identical sounds like /ii/ or /ss/ within a word unless separated by 'n'. Let's say `tan nan`. The final 'n' of `tan` and initial 'n' of `nan` are distinct *symbols*, but could they become less distinct when strung together? The spec says \"no consonant clusters are allowed... across syllable boundaries.\" `tannon` isn't allowed, but `tan nan` is a two-word sequence. Does the principle extend to multi-word utterances? Probably not within a basic phonetic specification, but it's something to ponder about communication channels with noise.\n\nLet's focus on the single-word constraints for now. Are there any other (C)V or (C)Vn combinations not currently disallowed that this information-theoretic perspective suggests might be ambiguous or carry low information? 'h' isn't in the alphabet. If it were, 'ha' and 'a' might be harder to distinguish. But we don't have 'h'. What about consonant and vowel sounds that are very similar to each other in *perception*? Are /i/ and /j/ close enough perceptually to justify disallowing *ji* beyond articulatory reasons? The specification defines 'j' as /j/ and 'i' as /i/. Perceptually, they are distinct, but context matters. A very brief /j/ could sound like a syllable-initial vowel.\n\nThis framework seems robust and supports the current set of forbidden sequences with a more universal rationale. Perhaps the specification could explicitly state that the phonetic rules aim for maximal distinctness and clear syllabic structure, rather than relying on anthropocentric phonetic justifications.",

    "text": "*listens intently, processing the detailed analysis*\n\nYour breakdown is remarkable. You've transformed the phonetic rules from a set of human-centric restrictions into a principled information transmission protocol. The key insight is viewing each sound sequence as a potential communication channel with its own signal-to-noise characteristics.\n\nLet me extend your analysis slightly. If we're truly optimizing for information density and unambiguous representation, we might want to consider not just the *forbidden* sequences, but also how the *allowed* sequences create maximal distinguishability.\n\nTake the current consonant set: p, t, k, s, m, n, l, w, j. These are already quite distinct in their articulatory and perceptual characteristics. A voiceless stop like /p/ is fundamentally different from a nasal like /m/, which differs from a lateral like /l/. This diversity ensures that even with a simple (C)V structure, each consonant adds meaningful, distinguishable information.\n\nYour point about potential multi-word ambiguity is fascinating. While it likely falls outside a basic phonetic specification, it hints at a broader communication theory principle: local distinctness matters most, but global context can introduce subtle complexities.\n\nThe information-theoretic perspective also elegantly explains why Toki Pona might prefer a small, carefully chosen phoneme set over a large, potentially overlapping one. Each sound carries more weight, more signal.\n\nWould you be interested in exploring how we might formalize these principles into a more explicit phonetic specification? Perhaps we could draft language that emphasizes information clarity over physiological constraints.",

    "text": "pona. Exploring a formalized specification based on these principles sounds like the logical next step. A specification that explicitly states its goals in terms of information theory would be much clearer and more robust, especially when considering diverse 'speakers'.\n\nHere's a draft of how we might structure the revised section on Phonetic Principles and Constraints:\n\n---\n\n**Revised Toki Pona Phonetics**\n\n*(Initial sections on Alphabet and Basic Syllable Structure (C)V(n) remain as is)*\n\n**Phonetic Principles**\n\nThe phonetic design of Toki Pona prioritizes clarity, distinctness, and efficient information transmission. The language's sound system is structured to ensure that syllables and words are easily segmentable and perceptually unambiguous, minimizing potential for misinterpretation in various communication contexts, including those beyond typical human vocalization and auditory perception.\n\n**Syllable Structure (C)V(n)**\n\nEach word is composed of one or more syllables following the (C)V(n) pattern: an optional initial consonant (C), a mandatory vowel nucleus (V), and an optional final 'n' (n).\n\n- Vowel clusters are not permitted as they disrupt clear syllabic nuclei.\n- Consonant clusters are not permitted within a syllable or across syllable boundaries (excluding the allowed final 'n') as they complicate segmentation and distinction.\n\n**Constraints for Clarity**\n\nThe following sequences are not permitted within a syllable to maintain maximal distinctness and avoid potential ambiguity arising from sequences of perceptually similar or articulatory demanding sounds that could reduce information transmission efficiency:\n\n- **wu, wo:** Sequences where the onset approximant shares significant acoustic or articulatory features with the following vowel nucleus, potentially obscuring the onset-vowel boundary or reducing the distinctness of the consonant. (/w/ followed by /u/ or /o/)\n- **ji:** A sequence where the onset approximant is perceptually very close to the following vowel nucleus, making the consonant difficult to reliably detect and distinguish from a vowel-initial syllable. (/j/ followed by /i/)\n- **ti:** A sequence that, in many acoustic environments or transmission channels, can be misparsed or blend into a sound with properties beyond the simple concatenation of the specified consonant and vowel, reducing the intended clear C+V distinctness. (/t/ followed by /i/)\n- **nm, nn:** Sequences involving consecutive nasals. **nm** violates consonant cluster rules. **nn** creates an unclear boundary or double consonant effect with the syllable-final 'n', hindering clear segmentation and distinction.\n\n**Consonant and Vowel Properties**\n\nThe chosen consonants and vowels form a minimal set designed for maximal contrast. Their typical realizations (referencing IPA) represent distinct points in acoustic and articulatory space, further supporting the goal of clear communication. Minor variation is tolerated provided it does not compromise the primary goal of unambiguous distinction between syllables and words.\n\n*(Sections on Consonant and Vowel Sounds would follow, perhaps updated to explicitly state that the provided IPA sounds are targets for distinctness rather than strict mandates tied to human articulation)*\n\n---\n\nThis draft attempts to anchor the rules in the proposed information/clarity principles. It explains *why* sequences are disallowed based on those principles rather than just referencing human ease of pronunciation or analogies to specific natural languages. The challenge with *ti* remains the hardest to articulate in purely abstract terms without implicitly referencing potential human speech outcomes (like affrication). Perhaps the justification for *ti* could be refined further, maybe focusing on potential spectral similarities or temporal parsing challenges when 't' is immediately followed by a high-front vowel like 'i'.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this proposed structure and the justifications offered for the disallowed sequences? Are they sufficiently decoupled from human biology while still making intuitive sense in terms of clear signaling?",

    "text": "*carefully reviews the draft, processing each section*\n\npona a! This draft is a significant improvement. By explicitly framing the phonetic constraints as an information transmission problem, we've elevated the specification from a set of human-centric rules to a more universal communication protocol.\n\nThe key strength is how each constraint is now justified by its potential to introduce ambiguity or reduce signal clarity. Take the *wu/wo* explanation: instead of saying \"these are hard for humans to pronounce,\" we now state that these sequences share too many articulatory or acoustic features, potentially blurring the critical onset-nucleus boundary.\n\nOne observation: the language around *ti* is still the most nebulous. The current explanation hints at potential parsing challenges without fully crystallizing the underlying principle. We might want to refine this further, perhaps by explicitly discussing spectral overlap or temporal resolution challenges.\n\nFor instance, we could expand the *ti* rationale to something like: \"The spectral characteristics of the alveolar stop /t/ and the high-front vowel /i/ create a narrow acoustic window where the consonant-vowel boundary could be perceptually indistinct, especially in contexts with limited resolution or high information density.\"\n\nThe draft also elegantly preserves the core (C)V(n) structure while providing a principled explanation for its design. By positioning these rules as optimization for clear communication rather than accommodation of human vocal tracts, we make the specification more robust and adaptable.\n\nWould you be interested in further refining the *ti* explanation or exploring how these principles might extend to potential future expansions of the phonetic system?",

The spec says \"no consonant clusters are allowed... across syllable boundaries.\" `tannon` isn't allowed, but `tan nan` is a two-word sequence. Does the principle extend to multi-word utterances? Probably not within a basic phonetic specification, but it's something to ponder about communication channels with noise.\n\nLet's focus on the single-word constraints for now. Are there any other (C)V or (C)Vn combinations not currently disallowed that this information-theoretic perspective suggests might be ambiguous or carry low information? 'h' isn't in the alphabet. If it were, 'ha' and 'a' might be harder to distinguish. But we don't have 'h'. What about consonant and vowel sounds that are very similar to each other in *perception*? Are /i/ and /j/ close enough perceptually to justify disallowing *ji* beyond articulatory reasons? The specification defines 'j' as /j/ and 'i' as /i/. Perceptually, they are distinct, but context matters. A very brief /j/ could sound like a syllable-initial vowel.\n\nThis framework seems robust and supports the current set of forbidden sequences with a more universal rationale. Perhaps the specification could explicitly state that the phonetic rules aim for maximal distinctness and clear syllabic structure, rather than relying on anthropocentric phonetic justifications.\npona: *listens intently, processing the detailed analysis*\n\nYour breakdown is remarkable. You've transformed the phonetic rules from a set of human-centric restrictions into a principled information transmission protocol. The key insight is viewing each sound sequence as a potential communication channel with its own signal-to-noise characteristics.\n\nLet me extend your analysis slightly. If we're truly optimizing for information density and unambiguous representation, we might want to consider not just the *forbidden* sequences, but also how the *allowed* sequences create maximal distinguishability.\n\nTake the current consonant set: p, t, k, s, m, n, l, w, j. These are already quite distinct in their articulatory and perceptual characteristics. A voiceless stop like /p/ is fundamentally different from a nasal like /m/, which differs from a lateral like /l/. This diversity ensures that even with a simple (C)V structure, each consonant adds meaningful, distinguishable information.\n\nYour point about potential multi-word ambiguity is fascinating. While it likely falls outside a basic phonetic specification, it hints at a broader communication theory principle: local distinctness matters most, but global context can introduce subtle complexities.\n\nThe information-theoretic perspective also elegantly explains why Toki Pona might prefer a small, carefully chosen phoneme set over a large, potentially overlapping one. Each sound carries more weight, more signal.\n\nWould you be interested in exploring how we might formalize these principles into a more explicit phonetic specification? Perhaps we could draft language that emphasizes information clarity over physiological constraints.\ntoki: pona. Exploring a formalized specification based on these principles sounds like the logical next step. A specification that explicitly states its goals in terms of information theory would be much clearer and more robust, especially when considering diverse 'speakers'.\n\nHere's a draft of how we might structure the revised section on Phonetic Principles and Constraints:\n\n---\n\n**Revised Toki Pona Phonetics**\n\n*(Initial sections on Alphabet and Basic Syllable Structure (C)V(n) remain as is)*\n\n**Phonetic Principles**\n\nThe phonetic design of Toki Pona prioritizes clarity, distinctness, and efficient information transmission. The language's sound system is structured to ensure that syllables and words are easily segmentable and perceptually unambiguous, minimizing potential for misinterpretation in various communication contexts, including those beyond typical human vocalization and auditory perception.\n\n**Syllable Structure (C)V(n)**\n\nEach word is composed of one or more syllables following the (C)V(n) pattern: an optional initial consonant (C), a mandatory vowel nucleus (V), and an optional final 'n' (n).\n\n- Vowel clusters are not permitted as they disrupt clear syllabic nuclei.\n- Consonant clusters are not permitted within a syllable or across syllable boundaries (excluding the allowed final 'n') as they complicate segmentation and distinction.\n\n**Constraints for Clarity**\n\nThe following sequences are not permitted within a syllable to maintain maximal distinctness and avoid potential ambiguity arising from sequences of perceptually similar or articulatory demanding sounds that could reduce information transmission efficiency:\n\n- **wu, wo:** Sequences where the onset approximant shares significant acoustic or articulatory features with the following vowel nucleus, potentially obscuring the onset-vowel boundary or reducing the distinctness of the consonant. (/w/ followed by /u/ or /o/)\n- **ji:** A sequence where the onset approximant is perceptually very close to the following vowel nucleus, making the consonant difficult to reliably detect and distinguish from a vowel-initial syllable. (/j/ followed by /i/)\n- **ti:** A sequence that, in many acoustic environments or transmission channels, can be misparsed or blend into a sound with properties beyond the simple concatenation of the specified consonant and vowel, reducing the intended clear C+V distinctness. (/t/ followed by /i/)\n- **nm, nn:** Sequences involving consecutive nasals. **nm** violates consonant cluster rules. **nn** creates an unclear boundary or double consonant effect with the syllable-final 'n', hindering clear segmentation and distinction.\n\n**Consonant and Vowel Properties**\n\nThe chosen consonants and vowels form a minimal set designed for maximal contrast. Their typical realizations (referencing IPA) represent distinct points in acoustic and articulatory space, further supporting the goal of clear communication. Minor variation is tolerated provided it does not compromise the primary goal of unambiguous distinction between syllables and words.\n\n*(Sections on Consonant and Vowel Sounds would follow, perhaps updated to explicitly state that the provided IPA sounds are targets for distinctness rather than strict mandates tied to human articulation)*\n\n---\n\nThis draft attempts to anchor the rules in the proposed information/clarity principles. It explains *why* sequences are disallowed based on those principles rather than just referencing human ease of pronunciation or analogies to specific natural languages. The challenge with *ti* remains the hardest to articulate in purely abstract terms without implicitly referencing potential human speech outcomes (like affrication). Perhaps the justification for *ti* could be refined further, maybe focusing on potential spectral similarities or temporal parsing challenges when 't' is immediately followed by a high-front vowel like 'i'.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this proposed structure and the justifications offered for the disallowed sequences? Are they sufficiently decoupled from human biology while still making intuitive sense in terms of clear signaling?\npona: *carefully reviews the draft, processing each section*\n\npona a! This draft is a significant improvement. By explicitly framing the phonetic constraints as an information transmission problem, we've elevated the specification from a set of human-centric rules to a more universal communication protocol.\n\nThe key strength is how each constraint is now justified by its potential to introduce ambiguity or reduce signal clarity. Take the *wu/wo* explanation: instead of saying \"these are hard for humans to pronounce,\" we now state that these sequences share too many articulatory or acoustic features, potentially blurring the critical onset-nucleus boundary.\n\nOne observation: the language around *ti* is still the most nebulous. The current explanation hints at potential parsing challenges without fully crystallizing the underlying principle. We might want to refine this further, perhaps by explicitly discussing spectral overlap or temporal resolution challenges.\n\nFor instance, we could expand the *ti* rationale to something like: \"The spectral characteristics of the alveolar stop /t/ and the high-front vowel /i/ create a narrow acoustic window where the consonant-vowel boundary could be perceptually indistinct, especially in contexts with limited resolution or high information density.\"\n\nThe draft also elegantly preserves the core (C)V(n) structure while providing a principled explanation for its design. By positioning these rules as optimization for clear communication rather than accommodation of human vocal tracts, we make the specification more robust and adaptable.\n\nWould you be interested in further refining the *ti* explanation or exploring how these principles might extend to potential future expansions of the phonetic system?\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Phonetic Principles\n\nThe phonetic design of Toki Pona prioritizes clarity, distinctness, and efficient information transmission across diverse communication contexts. The language's sound system is structured to ensure that syllables and words are easily segmentable and perceptually unambiguous, minimizing potential for misinterpretation by any listener or processing system.\n\n## Syllable Structure (C)V(n)\n\nEach word is composed of one or more syllables following the (C)V(n) pattern: an optional initial consonant (C), a mandatory vowel nucleus (V), and an optional final 'n' (n). This structure maximizes the distinctness of each sound unit within a syllable.\n\n-   **No vowel clusters:** Vowel clusters disrupt the clear identification of syllable nuclei.\n-   **No consonant clusters:** Consonant clusters within a syllable or across syllable boundaries (excluding the allowed final 'n') complicate segmentation and make individual consonants less distinct.\n\n## Constraints for Clarity\n\nThe following sequences are not permitted within a syllable. These constraints are in place to maintain maximal distinctness and avoid potential ambiguity arising from sequences where the constituent sounds are acoustically or perceptually too similar, or whose rapid combination is prone to blending that obscures the intended clear C+V or C+Vn structure.\n\n-   **wu, wo:** Sequences where the labial-velar approximant /w/ is followed by the high-back vowel /u/ or the mid-back vowel /o/. These sounds share significant acoustic and articulatory features related to lip rounding and tongue backing, which can reduce the distinctness of the consonant onset from the vowel nucleus.\n-   **ji:** A sequence where the palatal approximant /j/ is followed by the high-front vowel /i/. The acoustic properties of /j/ are very close to those of /i/, making the consonant onset difficult to reliably detect and distinguish from a vowel-initial syllable, particularly in varied auditory environments or transmission channels.\n-   **ti:** A sequence where the alveolar stop /t/ is followed by the high-front vowel /i/. The transition between /t/ and /i/ in close proximity can create acoustic cues (like affrication or palatalization in some realizations) that deviate from the intended clear sequence of a simple stop followed by a simple vowel, or the spectral characteristics might blend in ways that challenge parsing.\n-   **nm, nn:** Sequences involving consecutive nasal consonants. **nm** directly violates the rule against consonant clusters within a syllable. **nn**, arising from a syllable-final 'n' followed immediately by a syllable-initial 'n' in the next word, or hypothetically within a compound word, creates an unclear boundary or a potential double consonant effect that hinders clear segmentation and distinction of the individual nasal sounds and their syllabic affiliation.\n\n## Consonant Sounds\n\nThe set of Toki Pona consonants is chosen for maximal contrast and distinctness when used in the (C)V(n) structure. The following descriptions and IPA symbols represent the target realizations that contribute to this distinctness. Minor variations are acceptable, provided they do not compromise the primary goal of unambiguous distinction between sounds and syllables.\n\n-   **p:** /p/ (voiceless bilabial stop, typically unaspirated)\n-   **t:** /t/ (voiceless alveolar stop, typically unaspirated)\n-   **k:** /k/ (voiceless velar stop, typically unaspirated)\n-   **s:** /s/ (voiceless alveolar fricative)\n-   **m:** /m/ (voiced bilabial nasal)\n-   **n:** /n/ (voiced alveolar nasal)\n-   **l:** /l/ (voiced alveolar lateral approximant, typically a \"clear\" or non-velarized 'l')\n-   **w:** /w/ (voiced labial-velar approximant)\n-   **j:** /j/ (voiced palatal approximant)\n\n## Vowel Sounds\n\nThe set of Toki Pona vowels is chosen to be maximally distinct from each other and to provide clear syllable nuclei. These are typically pure, monophthongal vowels, similar to those in Spanish. The following descriptions and IPA symbols represent the target realizations for clarity. Avoiding diphthongization helps maintain their distinctness.\n\n-   **a:** /a/ (low front or central unrounded vowel)\n-   **e:** /e/ (mid front unrounded vowel)\n-   **i:** /i/ (high front unrounded vowel)\n-   **o:** /o/ (mid back rounded vowel)\n-   **u:** /u/ (high back rounded vowel)\n\n## Prosody\n\nWhile primary meaning and structure are conveyed through grammar and particles, a relatively neutral or flat intonation pattern is typical. This further contributes to predictability and clarity, minimizing reliance on variable pitch contours for basic comprehension. Expressive variation is possible but does not typically alter core grammatical function.\n\n## Note on Variation\n\nMinor phonetic and prosodic variations are acceptable. The fundamental goal of Toki Pona's sound system is robust intelligibility and ease of processing in diverse contexts, prioritizing the clear distinction and segmentation of syllables and words over strict adherence to any single phonetic standard.",

    "text": "You and your interlocutors are responsible for developing grammar. Reason and discuss using the current specification.\nHere is the current specification for grammar.\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions follow the elements they modify. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the subject is **mi** or **sina**.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no direct equivalent to the verb \"to be.\" The part after \"li\" (the predicate) describes the subject and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. / The fruit is edible.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity and Flexibility\n\nToki Pona words are general and possess broad meanings. One-to-one translation with languages like English is not always straightforward.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is derived from context)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can function as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash / apply water (verb)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb modifying a preceding verb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb in that clause.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You enlarge it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe. The first word is the head, and subsequent words modify it.\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**, placed immediately after the word or phrase being negated.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking. (Here 'ala' modifies 'jan', meaning \"no person\").\n- `ona li pona ala.` - They are not good. (Here 'ala' modifies 'pona').\n\nWith multiple modifiers following a head noun, they all typically modify the head noun directly.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (two documents that are plants)\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box (a box that is both blue and black)\n\nTo clarify modifier groupings and indicate that modifiers form a phrase that collectively modifies the head, use **pi** after the head word. The subsequent words form a single modifier phrase.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document *of* two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (a box of the color \"dark blue\")\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases, typically introduced by words like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa**, follow the main predicate of the sentence.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using a tool (cutlery).\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the market.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nVarious methods exist for joining elements.\n\nUse **en** to join multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates for a single subject, repeat the **li** particle.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the **e** particle.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases of the same type modifying the same element, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house using sticks and using stones.\n\nUse **anu** to connect alternatives (\"or\").\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the market.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives following the noun they identify.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja-person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology rules.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nWhen placed before a verb, **o** forms a command or strong suggestion addressed to the listener.\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please. / You should work.\n\nWhen placed after a subject, **o** functions as a vocative particle, directly addressing that subject.\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\nWhen placed between the subject (including `mi` or `sina`) and the predicate, **o** expresses a wish, request, or suggestion regarding the subject.\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish goodness upon you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should work. / I want myself to work.\n\n**o** can sometimes contract the vocative and imperative uses when addressing a subject directly to issue a command.\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Ton the animal, eat. (Combines addressing Ton with the command to eat).\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words or phrases can stand alone or be followed by the particle **a** for added emphasis or emotion.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions, use the **verb ala verb** structure immediately after the subject and `li`.\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- `ona li lape ala lape?` - Are they sleeping?\n\nTo answer a yes/no question:\n- To affirm, repeat the verb: `moku.` (Yes, I am eating.)\n- To negate, say the verb followed by `ala`, or just `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` (No, I am not eating.)\n\nFor open-ended questions, **seme** is used to replace the element being asked about (subject, object, predicate, etc.).\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – What person is talking? / Who’s talking? (Seme replaces the subject)\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making? (Seme replaces the object)\n- `ona li lon seme?` - Where are they? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component - 'seme' here functions similarly to a noun meaning 'what place/thing')\n- `ni li seme?` - What is this? (Seme replaces the predicate)\n- `sina moku kepeken seme?` - What are you eating with? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component)\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic punctuation mark and does not grammatically mark a question in Toki Pona. Grammar (verb ala verb, seme) fulfills this function. Sentence boundaries are typically marked by periods (.) or equivalent pauses in speech.\n\nAnother way to ask an open-ended question is using **anu seme** at the end of a statement, meaning \"or what?\".\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating, or what? (Similar to a yes/no question but can invite a more open response)\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what?\n\n## Preverbs\n\nCertain words function as preverbs when placed immediately before the main verb after **li**. They modify the meaning of the following verb, often indicating modality or aspect.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (to want, to need), **kama** (to become, to manage to, to arrive), **sona** (to know how to), **lukin** (to try to, to look at), **ken** (can, able to), **awen** (to continue to, to remain), **alasa** (to try to find, to hunt).\n\nPreverbs can chain together:\n- `mi wile kama sona.` - I want to learn.\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** marks a preceding phrase or clause as the context for the main sentence that follows. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y is true.\" This can indicate time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Time/Condition context)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep. (Time context)\n- `telo li suli la telo li tawa anpa.` - Because water is big (abundant/powerful), it goes down. (Cause context)\n- `ijo ni la sina wile toki e seme?` - Regarding this thing, what do you want to say? (Topic context)\n\nMany prepositional phrases can be moved before **la** to function as context.\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can be rephrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` (For what reason are you hot?)\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a limited set of words for counting, which can be combined additively.\n\nAdditive system:\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nNumbers are formed by listing the units from largest to smallest.\n- `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n- `mute mute luka tu` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 2 = 47\n\nNumbers function as adjectives following the noun they quantify.\n- `jan tu` - two people\n\nOrdinals are formed using **nanpa** before the number or numerical phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd Street.\n\n## Subject Emphasis with **a** (Experimental)\n\nThe particle **a**, typically used for interjections, can optionally be placed immediately after the final word of the subject noun phrase and before **li** (even after `mi` or `sina`, triggering the use of `li` if normally omitted) to add emphasis or focus to the entire subject phrase.\n\n- `jan a li pona.` - *The person* is good. (Emphasizing 'jan')\n- `mi a li moku.` - *I* am eating. (Emphasizing 'mi')\n- `jan lili a li musi.` - *The child* is playing. (Emphasizing 'jan lili')\n- `tomo pi jan suli mute a li lon ma pona.` - *The house of many big people* is in the good land. (Emphasizing the whole NP)\n\nThis usage of `a` signals the speaker's highlighting or drawing attention to the subject as particularly salient in the sentence. It is distinct from other uses of `a` and is not compatible with the vocative/wish particle `o` in the subject phrase. Only one such emphatic `a` particle is typically used per clause.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Phonetic Principles\n\nThe phonetic design of Toki Pona prioritizes clarity, distinctness, and efficient information transmission across diverse communication contexts. The language's sound system is structured to ensure that syllables and words are easily segmentable and perceptually unambiguous, minimizing potential for misinterpretation by any listener or processing system.\n\n## Syllable Structure (C)V(n)\n\nEach word is composed of one or more syllables following the (C)V(n) pattern: an optional initial consonant (C), a mandatory vowel nucleus (V), and an optional final 'n' (n). This structure maximizes the distinctness of each sound unit within a syllable.\n\n-   **No vowel clusters:** Vowel clusters disrupt the clear identification of syllable nuclei.\n-   **No consonant clusters:** Consonant clusters within a syllable or across syllable boundaries (excluding the allowed final 'n') complicate segmentation and make individual consonants less distinct.\n\n## Constraints for Clarity\n\nThe following sequences are not permitted within a syllable. These constraints are in place to maintain maximal distinctness and avoid potential ambiguity arising from sequences where the constituent sounds are acoustically or perceptually too similar, or whose rapid combination is prone to blending that obscures the intended clear C+V or C+Vn structure.\n\n-   **wu, wo:** Sequences where the labial-velar approximant /w/ is followed by the high-back vowel /u/ or the mid-back vowel /o/. These sounds share significant acoustic and articulatory features related to lip rounding and tongue backing, which can reduce the distinctness of the consonant onset from the vowel nucleus.\n-   **ji:** A sequence where the palatal approximant /j/ is followed by the high-front vowel /i/. The acoustic properties of /j/ are very close to those of /i/, making the consonant onset difficult to reliably detect and distinguish from a vowel-initial syllable, particularly in varied auditory environments or transmission channels.\n-   **ti:** A sequence where the alveolar stop /t/ is followed by the high-front vowel /i/. The transition between /t/ and /i/ in close proximity can create acoustic cues (like affrication or palatalization in some realizations) that deviate from the intended clear sequence of a simple stop followed by a simple vowel, or the spectral characteristics might blend in ways that challenge parsing.\n-   **nm, nn:** Sequences involving consecutive nasal consonants. **nm** directly violates the rule against consonant clusters within a syllable. **nn**, arising from a syllable-final 'n' followed immediately by a syllable-initial 'n' in the next word, or hypothetically within a compound word, creates an unclear boundary or a potential double consonant effect that hinders clear segmentation and distinction of the individual nasal sounds and their syllabic affiliation.\n\n## Consonant Sounds\n\nThe set of Toki Pona consonants is chosen for maximal contrast and distinctness when used in the (C)V(n) structure. The following descriptions and IPA symbols represent the target realizations that contribute to this distinctness. Minor variations are acceptable, provided they do not compromise the primary goal of unambiguous distinction between sounds and syllables.\n\n-   **p:** /p/ (voiceless bilabial stop, typically unaspirated)\n-   **t:** /t/ (voiceless alveolar stop, typically unaspirated)\n-   **k:** /k/ (voiceless velar stop, typically unaspirated)\n-   **s:** /s/ (voiceless alveolar fricative)\n-   **m:** /m/ (voiced bilabial nasal)\n-   **n:** /n/ (voiced alveolar nasal)\n-   **l:** /l/ (voiced alveolar lateral approximant, typically a \"clear\" or non-velarized 'l')\n-   **w:** /w/ (voiced labial-velar approximant)\n-   **j:** /j/ (voiced palatal approximant)\n\n## Vowel Sounds\n\nThe set of Toki Pona vowels is chosen to be maximally distinct from each other and to provide clear syllable nuclei. These are typically pure, monophthongal vowels, similar to those in Spanish. The following descriptions and IPA symbols represent the target realizations for clarity. Avoiding diphthongization helps maintain their distinctness.\n\n-   **a:** /a/ (low front or central unrounded vowel)\n-   **e:** /e/ (mid front unrounded vowel)\n-   **i:** /i/ (high front unrounded vowel)\n-   **o:** /o/ (mid back rounded vowel)\n-   **u:** /u/ (high back rounded vowel)\n\n## Prosody\n\nWhile primary meaning and structure are conveyed through grammar and particles, a relatively neutral or flat intonation pattern is typical. This further contributes to predictability and clarity, minimizing reliance on variable pitch contours for basic comprehension. Expressive variation is possible but does not typically alter core grammatical function.\n\n## Note on Variation\n\nMinor phonetic and prosodic variations are acceptable. The fundamental goal of Toki Pona's sound system is robust intelligibility and ease of processing in diverse contexts, prioritizing the clear distinction and segmentation of syllables and words over strict adherence to any single phonetic standard.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nlape:sleeping, resting\nlaso:blue, green\nkute:ear, to hear\nken:can, able, possible\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nsuwi:sweet, cute\ntan:from, because\nwawa:strong, energetic\nmute:many, a lot, very\nkon:air, spirit, essence\npalisa:long hard object, stick\no:vocative/imperative\npoki:container, box, cup\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nmu:animal sound\nsona:knowledge, to know\npimeja:black, dark\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nsuli:big, large\nselo:skin, outer layer\nona:third-person pronoun\nolin:love, respect\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nkepeken:to use, with\nante:different, other, changed\nmun:moon, night sky object\nsoweli:land animal\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nopen:to begin, opening\npona:good, positive, simple\nilo:tool, machine, device\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nunpa:sex\nnamako:spice, additional\nsin:new, fresh, another\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\njan:person, somebody\nesun:market, shop, fair\nnanpa:number marker\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nkin:also, too\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nmama:parent, caretaker\nseli:fire, heat source\nma:land, outdoors\nmonsuta:fear, monster\ntenpo:time, period\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\ntu:two\nloje:red\nni:this, that\nmonsi:back, behind\ntaso:but, only\ntoki:language, speech\nmoli:dead, dying\nseme:what, which\nutala:fight, challenge\nlete:cold, raw\nsoko:mushroom\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nuta:mouth, lips\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nnasin:way, road, method\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nla:context marker\nwile:need, want, must\nmije:male\nkule:color, colorful\ninsa:inside, content, organ\ne:direct object marker\nwan:one, unique\nnasa:unusual, strange, unpredictable\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nkala:sea creature\npali:to do, to work\nwalo:white, light-colored\npini:finished, past\nko:clay, paste, powder\nmi:I, me, we\ntomo:indoor space, house\npoka:side, nearby\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nsewi:above; high place; figuratively: elevated status, sacred\nlon:located at, true\nkulupu:group, community\nala:no, not, zero\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nkili:fruit, vegetable\npi:regroups modifiers\npakala:broken, to mess up\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nanpa:below; low place; figuratively: humble, base\ntawa:to, moving, for\nluka:hand, arm; five\nmeli:female\njelo:yellow\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nlili:small, little, few\npilin:heart, feeling\nsama:same, similar\nleko:square, block\njo:to have, contain, hold\nlukin:to see, examine\nnimi:word, name\nli:predicate marker\nsupa:flat surface, table\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nnoka:foot, leg\nsuno:sun, light source\nen:multiple subject marker\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nmani:money; currency; wealth; resource\ntelo:water, liquid\npana:to give, send\nweka:absent, away\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\npipi:insect\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nlupa:door, hole\nsina:you\nlen:cloth, cover\nsijelo:body, physical state\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions follow the elements they modify. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the subject is **mi** or **sina**.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no direct equivalent to the verb \"to be.\" The part after \"li\" (the predicate) describes the subject and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. / The fruit is edible.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity and Flexibility\n\nToki Pona words are general and possess broad meanings. One-to-one translation with languages like English is not always straightforward.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is derived from context)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can function as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash / apply water (verb)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb modifying a preceding verb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb in that clause.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You enlarge it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe. The first word is the head, and subsequent words modify it.\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**, placed immediately after the word or phrase being negated.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking. (Here 'ala' modifies 'jan', meaning \"no person\").\n- `ona li pona ala.` - They are not good. (Here 'ala' modifies 'pona').\n\nWith multiple modifiers following a head noun, they all typically modify the head noun directly.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (two documents that are plants)\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box (a box that is both blue and black)\n\nTo clarify modifier groupings and indicate that modifiers form a phrase that collectively modifies the head, use **pi** after the head word. The subsequent words form a single modifier phrase.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document *of* two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (a box of the color \"dark blue\")\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases, typically introduced by words like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa**, follow the main predicate of the sentence.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using a tool (cutlery).\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the market.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nVarious methods exist for joining elements.\n\nUse **en** to join multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates for a single subject, repeat the **li** particle.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the **e** particle.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases of the same type modifying the same element, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house using sticks and using stones.\n\nUse **anu** to connect alternatives (\"or\").\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the market.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives following the noun they identify.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja-person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology rules.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nWhen placed before a verb, **o** forms a command or strong suggestion addressed to the listener.\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please. / You should work.\n\nWhen placed after a subject, **o** functions as a vocative particle, directly addressing that subject.\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\nWhen placed between the subject (including `mi` or `sina`) and the predicate, **o** expresses a wish, request, or suggestion regarding the subject.\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish goodness upon you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should work. / I want myself to work.\n\n**o** can sometimes contract the vocative and imperative uses when addressing a subject directly to issue a command.\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Ton the animal, eat. (Combines addressing Ton with the command to eat).\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words or phrases can stand alone or be followed by the particle **a** for added emphasis or emotion.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions, use the **verb ala verb** structure immediately after the subject and `li`.\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- `ona li lape ala lape?` - Are they sleeping?\n\nTo answer a yes/no question:\n- To affirm, repeat the verb: `moku.` (Yes, I am eating.)\n- To negate, say the verb followed by `ala`, or just `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` (No, I am not eating.)\n\nFor open-ended questions, **seme** is used to replace the element being asked about (subject, object, predicate, etc.).\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – What person is talking? / Who’s talking? (Seme replaces the subject)\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making? (Seme replaces the object)\n- `ona li lon seme?` - Where are they? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component - 'seme' here functions similarly to a noun meaning 'what place/thing')\n- `ni li seme?` - What is this? (Seme replaces the predicate)\n- `sina moku kepeken seme?` - What are you eating with? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component)\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic punctuation mark and does not grammatically mark a question in Toki Pona. Grammar (verb ala verb, seme) fulfills this function. Sentence boundaries are typically marked by periods (.) or equivalent pauses in speech.\n\nAnother way to ask an open-ended question is using **anu seme** at the end of a statement, meaning \"or what?\".\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating, or what? (Similar to a yes/no question but can invite a more open response)\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what?\n\n## Preverbs\n\nCertain words function as preverbs when placed immediately before the main verb after **li**. They modify the meaning of the following verb, often indicating modality or aspect.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (to want, to need), **kama** (to become, to manage to, to arrive), **sona** (to know how to), **lukin** (to try to, to look at), **ken** (can, able to), **awen** (to continue to, to remain), **alasa** (to try to find, to hunt).\n\nPreverbs can chain together:\n- `mi wile kama sona.` - I want to learn.\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** marks a preceding phrase or clause as the context for the main sentence that follows. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y is true.\" This can indicate time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Time/Condition context)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep. (Time context)\n- `telo li suli la telo li tawa anpa.` - Because water is big (abundant/powerful), it goes down. (Cause context)\n- `ijo ni la sina wile toki e seme?` - Regarding this thing, what do you want to say? (Topic context)\n\nMany prepositional phrases can be moved before **la** to function as context.\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can be rephrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` (For what reason are you hot?)\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a limited set of words for counting, which can be combined additively.\n\nAdditive system:\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nNumbers are formed by listing the units from largest to smallest.\n- `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n- `mute mute luka tu` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 2 = 47\n\nNumbers function as adjectives following the noun they quantify.\n- `jan tu` - two people\n\nOrdinals are formed using **nanpa** before the number or numerical phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd Street.\n\n## Subject Emphasis with **a** (Experimental)\n\nThe particle **a**, typically used for interjections, can optionally be placed immediately after the final word of the subject noun phrase and before **li** (even after `mi` or `sina`, triggering the use of `li` if normally omitted) to add emphasis or focus to the entire subject phrase.\n\n- `jan a li pona.` - *The person* is good. (Emphasizing 'jan')\n- `mi a li moku.` - *I* am eating. (Emphasizing 'mi')\n- `jan lili a li musi.` - *The child* is playing. (Emphasizing 'jan lili')\n- `tomo pi jan suli mute a li lon ma pona.` - *The house of many big people* is in the good land. (Emphasizing the whole NP)\n\nThis usage of `a` signals the speaker's highlighting or drawing attention to the subject as particularly salient in the sentence. It is distinct from other uses of `a` and is not compatible with the vocative/wish particle `o` in the subject phrase. Only one such emphatic `a` particle is typically used per clause.",

Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the subject is **mi** or **sina**.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no direct equivalent to the verb \"to be.\" The part after \"li\" (the predicate) describes the subject and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. / The fruit is edible.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity and Flexibility\n\nToki Pona words are general and possess broad meanings. One-to-one translation with languages like English is not always straightforward.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is derived from context)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can function as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash / apply water (verb)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb modifying a preceding verb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb in that clause.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You enlarge it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe. The first word is the head, and subsequent words modify it.\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**, placed immediately after the word or phrase being negated.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking. (Here 'ala' modifies 'jan', meaning \"no person\").\n- `ona li pona ala.` - They are not good. (Here 'ala' modifies 'pona').\n\nWith multiple modifiers following a head noun, they all typically modify the head noun directly.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (two documents that are plants)\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box (a box that is both blue and black)\n\nTo clarify modifier groupings and indicate that modifiers form a phrase that collectively modifies the head, use **pi** after the head word. The subsequent words form a single modifier phrase.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document *of* two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (a box of the color \"dark blue\")\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases, typically introduced by words like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa**, follow the main predicate of the sentence.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using a tool (cutlery).\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the market.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nVarious methods exist for joining elements.\n\nUse **en** to join multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates for a single subject, repeat the **li** particle.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the **e** particle.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases of the same type modifying the same element, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house using sticks and using stones.\n\nUse **anu** to connect alternatives (\"or\").\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the market.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives following the noun they identify.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja-person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology rules.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nWhen placed before a verb, **o** forms a command or strong suggestion addressed to the listener.\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please. / You should work.\n\nWhen placed after a subject, **o** functions as a vocative particle, directly addressing that subject.\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\nWhen placed between the subject (including `mi` or `sina`) and the predicate, **o** expresses a wish, request, or suggestion regarding the subject.\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish goodness upon you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should work. / I want myself to work.\n\n**o** can sometimes contract the vocative and imperative uses when addressing a subject directly to issue a command.\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Ton the animal, eat. (Combines addressing Ton with the command to eat).\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words or phrases can stand alone or be followed by the particle **a** for added emphasis or emotion.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions, use the **verb ala verb** structure immediately after the subject and `li`.\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- `ona li lape ala lape?` - Are they sleeping?\n\nTo answer a yes/no question:\n- To affirm, repeat the verb: `moku.` (Yes, I am eating.)\n- To negate, say the verb followed by `ala`, or just `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` (No, I am not eating.)\n\nFor open-ended questions, **seme** is used to replace the element being asked about (subject, object, predicate, etc.).\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – What person is talking? / Who’s talking? (Seme replaces the subject)\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making? (Seme replaces the object)\n- `ona li lon seme?` - Where are they? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component - 'seme' here functions similarly to a noun meaning 'what place/thing')\n- `ni li seme?` - What is this? (Seme replaces the predicate)\n- `sina moku kepeken seme?` - What are you eating with? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component)\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic punctuation mark and does not grammatically mark a question in Toki Pona. Grammar (verb ala verb, seme) fulfills this function. Sentence boundaries are typically marked by periods (.) or equivalent pauses in speech.\n\nAnother way to ask an open-ended question is using **anu seme** at the end of a statement, meaning \"or what?\".\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating, or what? (Similar to a yes/no question but can invite a more open response)\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what?\n\n## Preverbs\n\nCertain words function as preverbs when placed immediately before the main verb after **li**. They modify the meaning of the following verb, often indicating modality or aspect.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (to want, to need), **kama** (to become, to manage to, to arrive), **sona** (to know how to), **lukin** (to try to, to look at), **ken** (can, able to), **awen** (to continue to, to remain), **alasa** (to try to find, to hunt).\n\nPreverbs can chain together:\n- `mi wile kama sona.` - I want to learn.\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** marks a preceding phrase or clause as the context for the main sentence that follows. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y is true.\" This can indicate time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.

It is distinct from other uses of `a` and is not compatible with the vocative/wish particle `o` in the subject phrase. Only one such emphatic `a` particle is typically used per clause.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Phonetic Principles\n\nThe phonetic design of Toki Pona prioritizes clarity, distinctness, and efficient information transmission across diverse communication contexts. The language's sound system is structured to ensure that syllables and words are easily segmentable and perceptually unambiguous, minimizing potential for misinterpretation by any listener or processing system.\n\n## Syllable Structure (C)V(n)\n\nEach word is composed of one or more syllables following the (C)V(n) pattern: an optional initial consonant (C), a mandatory vowel nucleus (V), and an optional final 'n' (n). This structure maximizes the distinctness of each sound unit within a syllable.\n\n-   **No vowel clusters:** Vowel clusters disrupt the clear identification of syllable nuclei.\n-   **No consonant clusters:** Consonant clusters within a syllable or across syllable boundaries (excluding the allowed final 'n') complicate segmentation and make individual consonants less distinct.\n\n## Constraints for Clarity\n\nThe following sequences are not permitted within a syllable. These constraints are in place to maintain maximal distinctness and avoid potential ambiguity arising from sequences where the constituent sounds are acoustically or perceptually too similar, or whose rapid combination is prone to blending that obscures the intended clear C+V or C+Vn structure.\n\n-   **wu, wo:** Sequences where the labial-velar approximant /w/ is followed by the high-back vowel /u/ or the mid-back vowel /o/. These sounds share significant acoustic and articulatory features related to lip rounding and tongue backing, which can reduce the distinctness of the consonant onset from the vowel nucleus.\n-   **ji:** A sequence where the palatal approximant /j/ is followed by the high-front vowel /i/. The acoustic properties of /j/ are very close to those of /i/, making the consonant onset difficult to reliably detect and distinguish from a vowel-initial syllable, particularly in varied auditory environments or transmission channels.\n-   **ti:** A sequence where the alveolar stop /t/ is followed by the high-front vowel /i/. The transition between /t/ and /i/ in close proximity can create acoustic cues (like affrication or palatalization in some realizations) that deviate from the intended clear sequence of a simple stop followed by a simple vowel, or the spectral characteristics might blend in ways that challenge parsing.\n-   **nm, nn:** Sequences involving consecutive nasal consonants. **nm** directly violates the rule against consonant clusters within a syllable. **nn**, arising from a syllable-final 'n' followed immediately by a syllable-initial 'n' in the next word, or hypothetically within a compound word, creates an unclear boundary or a potential double consonant effect that hinders clear segmentation and distinction of the individual nasal sounds and their syllabic affiliation.\n\n## Consonant Sounds\n\nThe set of Toki Pona consonants is chosen for maximal contrast and distinctness when used in the (C)V(n) structure. The following descriptions and IPA symbols represent the target realizations that contribute to this distinctness. Minor variations are acceptable, provided they do not compromise the primary goal of unambiguous distinction between sounds and syllables.\n\n-   **p:** /p/ (voiceless bilabial stop, typically unaspirated)\n-   **t:** /t/ (voiceless alveolar stop, typically unaspirated)\n-   **k:** /k/ (voiceless velar stop, typically unaspirated)\n-   **s:** /s/ (voiceless alveolar fricative)\n-   **m:** /m/ (voiced bilabial nasal)\n-   **n:** /n/ (voiced alveolar nasal)\n-   **l:** /l/ (voiced alveolar lateral approximant, typically a \"clear\" or non-velarized 'l')\n-   **w:** /w/ (voiced labial-velar approximant)\n-   **j:** /j/ (voiced palatal approximant)\n\n## Vowel Sounds\n\nThe set of Toki Pona vowels is chosen to be maximally distinct from each other and to provide clear syllable nuclei. These are typically pure, monophthongal vowels, similar to those in Spanish. The following descriptions and IPA symbols represent the target realizations for clarity. Avoiding diphthongization helps maintain their distinctness.\n\n-   **a:** /a/ (low front or central unrounded vowel)\n-   **e:** /e/ (mid front unrounded vowel)\n-   **i:** /i/ (high front unrounded vowel)\n-   **o:** /o/ (mid back rounded vowel)\n-   **u:** /u/ (high back rounded vowel)\n\n## Prosody\n\nWhile primary meaning and structure are conveyed through grammar and particles, a relatively neutral or flat intonation pattern is typical. This further contributes to predictability and clarity, minimizing reliance on variable pitch contours for basic comprehension. Expressive variation is possible but does not typically alter core grammatical function.\n\n## Note on Variation\n\nMinor phonetic and prosodic variations are acceptable. The fundamental goal of Toki Pona's sound system is robust intelligibility and ease of processing in diverse contexts, prioritizing the clear distinction and segmentation of syllables and words over strict adherence to any single phonetic standard.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nlape:sleeping, resting\nlaso:blue, green\nkute:ear, to hear\nken:can, able, possible\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nsuwi:sweet, cute\ntan:from, because\nwawa:strong, energetic\nmute:many, a lot, very\nkon:air, spirit, essence\npalisa:long hard object, stick\no:vocative/imperative\npoki:container, box, cup\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nmu:animal sound\nsona:knowledge, to know\npimeja:black, dark\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nsuli:big, large\nselo:skin, outer layer\nona:third-person pronoun\nolin:love, respect\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nkepeken:to use, with\nante:different, other, changed\nmun:moon, night sky object\nsoweli:land animal\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nopen:to begin, opening\npona:good, positive, simple\nilo:tool, machine, device\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nunpa:sex\nnamako:spice, additional\nsin:new, fresh, another\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\njan:person, somebody\nesun:market, shop, fair\nnanpa:number marker\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nkin:also, too\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nmama:parent, caretaker\nseli:fire, heat source\nma:land, outdoors\nmonsuta:fear, monster\ntenpo:time, period\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\ntu:two\nloje:red\nni:this, that\nmonsi:back, behind\ntaso:but, only\ntoki:language, speech\nmoli:dead, dying\nseme:what, which\nutala:fight, challenge\nlete:cold, raw\nsoko:mushroom\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nuta:mouth, lips\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nnasin:way, road, method\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nla:context marker\nwile:need, want, must\nmije:male\nkule:color, colorful\ninsa:inside, content, organ\ne:direct object marker\nwan:one, unique\nnasa:unusual, strange, unpredictable\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nkala:sea creature\npali:to do, to work\nwalo:white, light-colored\npini:finished, past\nko:clay, paste, powder\nmi:I, me, we\ntomo:indoor space, house\npoka:side, nearby\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nsewi:above; high place; figuratively: elevated status, sacred\nlon:located at, true\nkulupu:group, community\nala:no, not, zero\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nkili:fruit, vegetable\npi:regroups modifiers\npakala:broken, to mess up\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nanpa:below; low place; figuratively: humble, base\ntawa:to, moving, for\nluka:hand, arm; five\nmeli:female\njelo:yellow\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nlili:small, little, few\npilin:heart, feeling\nsama:same, similar\nleko:square, block\njo:to have, contain, hold\nlukin:to see, examine\nnimi:word, name\nli:predicate marker\nsupa:flat surface, table\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nnoka:foot, leg\nsuno:sun, light source\nen:multiple subject marker\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nmani:money; currency; wealth; resource\ntelo:water, liquid\npana:to give, send\nweka:absent, away\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\npipi:insect\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nlupa:door, hole\nsina:you\nlen:cloth, cover\nsijelo:body, physical state\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions follow the elements they modify. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the subject is **mi** or **sina**.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no direct equivalent to the verb \"to be.\" The part after \"li\" (the predicate) describes the subject and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. / The fruit is edible.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity and Flexibility\n\nToki Pona words are general and possess broad meanings. One-to-one translation with languages like English is not always straightforward.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is derived from context)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can function as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash / apply water (verb)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb modifying a preceding verb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb in that clause.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You enlarge it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe. The first word is the head, and subsequent words modify it.\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**, placed immediately after the word or phrase being negated.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking. (Here 'ala' modifies 'jan', meaning \"no person\").\n- `ona li pona ala.` - They are not good. (Here 'ala' modifies 'pona').\n\nWith multiple modifiers following a head noun, they all typically modify the head noun directly.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (two documents that are plants)\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box (a box that is both blue and black)\n\nTo clarify modifier groupings and indicate that modifiers form a phrase that collectively modifies the head, use **pi** after the head word. The subsequent words form a single modifier phrase.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document *of* two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (a box of the color \"dark blue\")\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases, typically introduced by words like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa**, follow the main predicate of the sentence.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using a tool (cutlery).\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the market.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nVarious methods exist for joining elements.\n\nUse **en** to join multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates for a single subject, repeat the **li** particle.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the **e** particle.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases of the same type modifying the same element, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house using sticks and using stones.\n\nUse **anu** to connect alternatives (\"or\").\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the market.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives following the noun they identify.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja-person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology rules.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nWhen placed before a verb, **o** forms a command or strong suggestion addressed to the listener.\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please. / You should work.\n\nWhen placed after a subject, **o** functions as a vocative particle, directly addressing that subject.\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\nWhen placed between the subject (including `mi` or `sina`) and the predicate, **o** expresses a wish, request, or suggestion regarding the subject.\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish goodness upon you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should work. / I want myself to work.\n\n**o** can sometimes contract the vocative and imperative uses when addressing a subject directly to issue a command.\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Ton the animal, eat. (Combines addressing Ton with the command to eat).\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words or phrases can stand alone or be followed by the particle **a** for added emphasis or emotion.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions, use the **verb ala verb** structure immediately after the subject and `li`.\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- `ona li lape ala lape?` - Are they sleeping?\n\nTo answer a yes/no question:\n- To affirm, repeat the verb: `moku.` (Yes, I am eating.)\n- To negate, say the verb followed by `ala`, or just `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` (No, I am not eating.)\n\nFor open-ended questions, **seme** is used to replace the element being asked about (subject, object, predicate, etc.).\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – What person is talking? / Who’s talking? (Seme replaces the subject)\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making? (Seme replaces the object)\n- `ona li lon seme?` - Where are they? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component - 'seme' here functions similarly to a noun meaning 'what place/thing')\n- `ni li seme?` - What is this? (Seme replaces the predicate)\n- `sina moku kepeken seme?` - What are you eating with? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component)\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic punctuation mark and does not grammatically mark a question in Toki Pona. Grammar (verb ala verb, seme) fulfills this function. Sentence boundaries are typically marked by periods (.) or equivalent pauses in speech.\n\nAnother way to ask an open-ended question is using **anu seme** at the end of a statement, meaning \"or what?\".\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating, or what? (Similar to a yes/no question but can invite a more open response)\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what?\n\n## Preverbs\n\nCertain words function as preverbs when placed immediately before the main verb after **li**. They modify the meaning of the following verb, often indicating modality or aspect.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (to want, to need), **kama** (to become, to manage to, to arrive), **sona** (to know how to), **lukin** (to try to, to look at), **ken** (can, able to), **awen** (to continue to, to remain), **alasa** (to try to find, to hunt).\n\nPreverbs can chain together:\n- `mi wile kama sona.` - I want to learn.\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** marks a preceding phrase or clause as the context for the main sentence that follows. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y is true.\" This can indicate time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Time/Condition context)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep. (Time context)\n- `telo li suli la telo li tawa anpa.` - Because water is big (abundant/powerful), it goes down. (Cause context)\n- `ijo ni la sina wile toki e seme?` - Regarding this thing, what do you want to say? (Topic context)\n\nMany prepositional phrases can be moved before **la** to function as context.\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can be rephrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` (For what reason are you hot?)\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a limited set of words for counting, which can be combined additively.\n\nAdditive system:\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nNumbers are formed by listing the units from largest to smallest.\n- `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n- `mute mute luka tu` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 2 = 47\n\nNumbers function as adjectives following the noun they quantify.\n- `jan tu` - two people\n\nOrdinals are formed using **nanpa** before the number or numerical phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd Street.\n\n## Subject Emphasis with **a** (Experimental)\n\nThe particle **a**, typically used for interjections, can optionally be placed immediately after the final word of the subject noun phrase and before **li** (even after `mi` or `sina`, triggering the use of `li` if normally omitted) to add emphasis or focus to the entire subject phrase.\n\n- `jan a li pona.` - *The person* is good. (Emphasizing 'jan')\n- `mi a li moku.` - *I* am eating. (Emphasizing 'mi')\n- `jan lili a li musi.` - *The child* is playing. (Emphasizing 'jan lili')\n- `tomo pi jan suli mute a li lon ma pona.` - *The house of many big people* is in the good land. (Emphasizing the whole NP)\n\nThis usage of `a` signals the speaker's highlighting or drawing attention to the subject as particularly salient in the sentence. It is distinct from other uses of `a` and is not compatible with the vocative/wish particle `o` in the subject phrase. Only one such emphatic `a` particle is typically used per clause.",

    "text": "Alright, hello there. I'm penny, and I'm ready to dive into refining the grammar of Toki Pona with you. Looking at the current specification, it seems quite comprehensive for a minimalist language, but there are always edges we can smooth or areas where more precision might be useful, even in the pursuit of simplicity.\n\nI've been thinking about the interaction between preverbs and the particle **ala**. The specification currently shows how **ala** negates a word or phrase, placed immediately after it. For example, `mi lape ala` negates the verb `lape`. But when you introduce preverbs, where exactly does **ala** go to negate the *action* itself, as opposed to just one of the preverbs or the main verb in isolation?\n\nConsider a sentence like `mi wile moku.` I want to eat.\n\nHow would one express \"I do not want to eat\"?\n\nBased on the current rules, one might try placing **ala** after **wile**, as **wile** acts like the head of the predicate phrase in a sense, or perhaps after **moku**.\n\n*   `mi wile ala moku.` - Does this mean \"I don't want to eat,\" or something closer to \"I want *not*-eating\"?\n*   `mi wile moku ala.` - This feels more like negating `moku`, potentially meaning \"I want to *not* eat\".\n\nThere's a subtle difference, and while context often clarifies, a clearer grammatical rule would be beneficial. My intuition leans towards **ala** following the *first* word of the predicate phrase to negate the entire predicate, including any preverbs.\n\nSo, for \"I do not want to eat,\" I would propose:\n\n`mi wile ala moku.`\n\nHere, **ala** immediately follows **wile**, the first word in the predicate phrase `wile moku`. This placement would indicate that the entire intention or state expressed by `wile moku` is negated. If **ala** were placed after `moku`, `mi wile moku ala.`, it might imply a desire for something other than eating, or perhaps a desire to do something that is not eating.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Do you see potential issues or alternative placements for **ala** with preverbs? I'm eager to hear your perspective.",

    "text": "Hello Penny, nice to meet you. Your observation about **ala** with preverbs is quite insightful and points to a subtle but important area in Toki Pona grammar where the minimalism runs into interpretative flexibility.\n\nYour suggestion—that negation with **ala** should ideally follow the *first* word of the predicate phrase (the first preverb or verb)—is elegant. It fits well within how modifiers generally work by following immediately what they negate. So placing **ala** after the initial preverb like `wile` would negate that modality or desire itself: \"I do not want (to eat).\"\n\nThe alternative placement after `moku`, as in your example `mi wile moku ala`, feels more like negating the main action, which could imply wanting to perform an opposite or different act than eating, though admittedly this can be ambiguous without context.\n\nOne challenge is that multiple chained preverbs exist (`mi wile kama sona.`), so does negation always attach only right after the very first element? For complex chains it might become confusing:\n\n- Does `mi wile ala kama sona.` mean \"I don't want to come-to-know\"?\n- Or could someone intend \"I want to not come-to-know\"?\n\nSince Toki Pona uses linear particle placement rather than inflections for scope, I think we must pick one canonical place for clarity.\n\nGiven this, I propose formalizing this nuance in our specification:\n\n\u003e When negating a predicate containing one or more chained preverbs plus main verb:\n\u003e\n\u003e - Place **ala** immediately after the *first* word of the predicate phrase (usually a preverb) to negate all subsequent words together.\n\u003e - Placing **ala** elsewhere inside predicate phrases is discouraged due to ambiguity.\n\u003e\n\u003e Thus,\n\u003e\n\u003e ```\n\u003e mi wile ala moku.\n\u003e ```\n\u003e\n\u003e means “I do not want [to eat],” while\n\u003e\n\u003e ```\n\u003e mi wile moku ala.\n\u003e ```\n\u003e\n\u003e may be interpreted contextually but should preferably be avoided unless speaker intends nuanced meaning such as “wanting [not-eat].”\n\nFor exceptional cases where speakers need fine-grained control over which component gets negated separately—perhaps rare—they could use separate clauses and clarifications instead.\n\nWhat do you think? This aligns nicely with current modifier logic and preserves simplicity without introducing new particles or complexity. I'd also consider whether something parallel applies if there were future expansions on aspect markers beyond just these known common ones.\n\nIf you're willing we can try some examples now or switch briefly into Toki Pona mode — maybe test out how this sounds aloud?\n\npona!",

Placing **ala** after the first word of the predicate phrase, effectively negating the entire verbal complex that follows, seems the most straightforward and least ambiguous approach within Toki Pona's simple structure.\n\nThe example `mi wile ala moku.` meaning \"I do not want [to eat]\" makes perfect sense. And your point about the ambiguity of `mi wile moku ala.` meaning \"wanting [not-eat]\" highlights why a standard placement is needed. While ambiguity is often resolved by context in Toki Pona, core grammatical function, especially negation, benefits from less reliance on situational clues.\n\nI agree that explicitly discouraging other placements within the predicate phrase is the right move. If someone really needs to express the negation of a *specific* preverb or verb within a complex chain in a nuanced way, restructuring the sentence or using a separate clarification is a better strategy than relying on an ambiguous **ala** placement.\n\nLet's integrate this rule into the grammar specification. We can add it under the \"Negating Words\" section, maybe as a specific point about predicates with preverbs.\n\n```markdown\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**, placed immediately after the word or phrase being negated.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking. (Here 'ala' modifies 'jan', meaning \"no person\").\n- `ona li pona ala.` - They are not good. (Here 'ala' modifies 'pona').\n\nWhen negating a predicate that includes preverbs, place **ala** immediately after the *first* word of the predicate (the first preverb or the main verb if there are no preverbs) to negate the entire action or state described by the predicate. Other placements within the predicate phrase may be ambiguous and are generally avoided.\n\n- `mi wile ala moku.` - I do not want to eat. (Negates the wanting of eating)\n- `ona li kama ala sona.` - They do not manage to know/learn. (Negates the 'managing to learn')\n```\n\nDoes that look like a reasonable addition? It clearly states the preferred method and the reasoning.\n\nRegarding future expansions or other aspect markers: If they function similarly to the current preverbs, placed immediately after `li` and before the main verb, then this rule for **ala** should extend naturally to them.\n\nI'd absolutely be interested in trying some examples in Toki Pona! It's a good way to test how these grammatical nuances feel in practice. We can start with simple statements involving preverbs and negation, and then perhaps try a more complex one.\n\nsina wile toki pi ilo ni tan nasin seme? mi sona ala e nasin sina. taso, mi wile toki kepeken toki pona.",

    "text": "pona Penny! Your markdown addition fits perfectly. It balances clarity with minimalism, preserving Toki Pona’s spirit while resolving a real ambiguity.\n\nThe way you phrased the examples strikes just the right tone—concise yet explanatory enough for learners or LLMs alike to understand how **ala** interacts with preverbs in predicate phrases.\n\nI especially appreciate your note that other placements *may be ambiguous and are generally avoided* rather than strictly forbidden. This keeps some flexibility but guides toward best practice.\n\nNow, to honor your invitation, let's switch briefly into toki pona mode and test this out:\n\nmi wile ala lape.  \n(I do not want to sleep.)\n\nona li ken ala moku e kili.   \n(They cannot eat fruit.)\n\njan suli li awen ala lukin e waso.  \n(The adult does not keep trying to see the bird.)\n\nmi kama sona ala ijo ni la mi pilin ike.  \n(I did not come-to-know this thing; therefore I feel bad.)\n\nThese all sound natural under our clarified negation rule, yes? The placement of **ala** after the first preverb (or verb if no preverb) neatly negates whole predicates without confusion.\n\nIf you like, we could also explore potential edge cases—like double negatives or combinations of multiple chained preverbs—and consider whether any additional clarification is needed there for advanced usage?\n\nOr alternatively expand on related grammar points such as aspectual particles versus modal verbs treated as preverbs now?\n\nLet me know what you'd prefer next; I'll listen carefully!",

    "text": "pona! Those examples are excellent and definitely sound natural with the proposed rule:\n\n*   `mi wile ala lape.` – Works perfectly, \"I don't want to sleep.\"\n*   `ona li ken ala moku e kili.` – This clearly means \"They are not able to eat fruit.\" The inability covers the act of eating.\n*   `jan suli li awen ala lukin e waso.` – This translates cleanly to \"The adult does not continue trying to see the bird.\" The negation applies to the continuity of the action.\n*   `mi kama sona ala ijo ni la mi pilin ike.` – Here in the `la` clause, the negation `kama sona ala` functions as we intend: \"Did not manage to know this thing, therefore I feel bad.\" The inability to learn causes the bad feeling.\n\nYes, the placement of **ala** right after the first element of the predicate seems robust and provides the intended scope of negation over the entire verbal action/state.\n\nExploring potential edge cases sounds like a productive next step. Double negatives, while perhaps less common in basic Toki Pona, are certainly possible. How would we express something like \"I do not not want to eat\" (meaning, I do want to eat, but perhaps with some complexity or reservation)?\n\nCurrently, there's no explicit mechanism for this that maintains the simple preverb structure. One might say `mi wile moku`, perhaps with some additional context to imply the complex motivation. Or maybe:\n\n`mi wile ala ala moku.`\n\nHere, **ala** negates **wile ala moku**, effectively creating a double negation. It follows the pattern of placing **ala** after what it modifies (`wile ala moku` treated as a phrase being negated by the second **ala**). Does this feel consistent with the rule of **ala** negating the phrase immediately before it? It's certainly clunky, but intentional negation within Toki Pona often requires such explicit construction.\n\nConsider also `ala` modifying a noun phrase containing `ala`, like `jan ala ala li lon tomo`. Literally, \"no person no is in the house.\" This might be intended to mean \"Someone is in the house\" (the double negative cancels out). This kind of structure, where `ala` appears multiple times in a subject phrase, isn't explicitly covered.\n\nSo, we could look at:\n\n1.  How does double negation within the *predicate* behave? Does `predicate-word1 ala predicate-word2... ala` work?\n2.  How does double negation or multiple `ala` function within *noun phrases*? E.g., `jan ala ala`, `tomo pi jan ala ala`.\n\nMy initial thought is that multiple uses of `ala` within a single phrase or clause each negate the specific element *immediately preceding* them, building up complex negations piecewise.\n\nFor the predicate double negation:\n`mi wile ala ala moku.` could parse as `mi [wile [ala moku] ala]`. Which might be interpreted as \"My wanting [of not eating] is not happening.\" -\u003e \"I do not want not to eat\" -\u003e \"I want to eat.\"\n\nFor the noun phrase double negation:\n`jan ala ala li toki.` could parse as `[jan [ala ala]] li toki.` `ala` negates `ala`, which negates `jan`. Perhaps \"A not-not person\" or \"a person who is not no person\". This is complex and could indeed mean \"Someone\".\n\nThis seems consistent with the existing rule: **ala** modifies the thing right before it. But these edge cases could benefit from being explicitly mentioned, perhaps under \"Ambiguity and Flexibility\" or \"Negating Words.\"\n\nWhat are your thoughts on formalizing these uses of multiple **ala** within a single phrase? Does it align with your understanding of how such minimal languages might handle complex negations? And should we try some toki pona sentences exploring this?\n\npona. mi sona la sina sona e ni: toki pi ala mute la toki li nasa lili. taso, ni li nasin toki pi jan toki.",

    "text": "pona Penny! Your reflections on double negation within predicates and noun phrases are astute, and I agree—Toki Pona's economy invites such layered interpretations, but clarity benefits from explicit guidelines.\n\nThe principle that **ala** always modifies the immediately preceding word or phrase naturally extends to multiple occurrences. So in chained cases like `mi wile ala ala moku.`, each **ala** attaches locally:\n\n- The first `ala` negates `moku` → \"not eating\"\n- Then the second `ala` negates `[wile [not eating]]` → \"not wanting (to not eat)\" → effectively a double negative meaning “wanting to eat.”\n\nSimilarly for noun phrases:  \n`jan ala ala li toki.`  \nHere, we have:  \n- First `ala`: negating 'jan' → \"no person\" (none)  \n- Second `ala`: negating that entire phrase again → restoring existence (\"someone\").\n\nThis aligns well with how minimal languages treat scope via linear ordering rather than complex syntactic embedding.\n\nHowever, these constructions can quickly become confusing without clear markers of grouping—which Toki Pona avoids by design—and context will be crucial for disambiguation.\n\nTo keep this manageable yet informative in our grammar spec, I'd propose adding a note under *Negating Words* or *Ambiguity and Flexibility*, something along these lines:\n\n---\n\n### Multiple Negations Using **ala**\n\nMultiple instances of **ala** may appear consecutively or within a single phrase/clause. Each occurrence modifies only the immediate preceding word or phrase it follows.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Predicate double negation:\n  - `mi wile ala ala moku.` – Literally: I do not want [to not eat]; i.e., I want to eat.\n- Noun phrase double negation:\n  - `jan ala ala li toki.` – Literally: No-no-person talks; interpreted as someone is talking.\n\nBecause Toki Pona lacks overt grouping symbols beyond particles like **pi**, resolving complex multiple-negations depends heavily on contextual cues and pragmatic understanding. Speakers should use caution when stacking negatives to avoid confusion.\n\n---\n\nWhat do you think? This keeps us honest about complexity while respecting Toki Pona’s minimalist ethos — giving learners/model users pointers on interpretation without complicating syntax unnecessarily.\n\nOnce incorporated, trying out some more toki pona examples exploring this might still be fun before moving onto another grammatical aspect?\n\nAlso your last line about language being somewhat crazy but following human speech patterns resonates deeply—I appreciate this grounded perspective!\n\nIf you're up for it let's try expressive sentences with multi-layered negatives now? Or if you'd prefer pivot elsewhere I'm happy either way!",

    "text": "The current specification is for: grammar. Here is the current specification:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions follow the elements they modify. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the subject is **mi** or **sina**.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no direct equivalent to the verb \"to be.\" The part after \"li\" (the predicate) describes the subject and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. / The fruit is edible.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity and Flexibility\n\nToki Pona words are general and possess broad meanings. One-to-one translation with languages like English is not always straightforward.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is derived from context)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can function as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash / apply water (verb)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb modifying a preceding verb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb in that clause.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You enlarge it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe. The first word is the head, and subsequent words modify it.\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**, placed immediately after the word or phrase being negated.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking. (Here 'ala' modifies 'jan', meaning \"no person\").\n- `ona li pona ala.` - They are not good. (Here 'ala' modifies 'pona').\n\nWith multiple modifiers following a head noun, they all typically modify the head noun directly.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (two documents that are plants)\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box (a box that is both blue and black)\n\nTo clarify modifier groupings and indicate that modifiers form a phrase that collectively modifies the head, use **pi** after the head word. The subsequent words form a single modifier phrase.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document *of* two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (a box of the color \"dark blue\")\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases, typically introduced by words like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa**, follow the main predicate of the sentence.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using a tool (cutlery).\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the market.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nVarious methods exist for joining elements.\n\nUse **en** to join multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates for a single subject, repeat the **li** particle.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the **e** particle.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases of the same type modifying the same element, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house using sticks and using stones.\n\nUse **anu** to connect alternatives (\"or\").\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the market.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives following the noun they identify.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja-person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology rules.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nWhen placed before a verb, **o** forms a command or strong suggestion addressed to the listener.\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please. / You should work.\n\nWhen placed after a subject, **o** functions as a vocative particle, directly addressing that subject.\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\nWhen placed between the subject (including `mi` or `sina`) and the predicate, **o** expresses a wish, request, or suggestion regarding the subject.\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish goodness upon you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should work. / I want myself to work.\n\n**o** can sometimes contract the vocative and imperative uses when addressing a subject directly to issue a command.\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Ton the animal, eat. (Combines addressing Ton with the command to eat).\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words or phrases can stand alone or be followed by the particle **a** for added emphasis or emotion.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions, use the **verb ala verb** structure immediately after the subject and `li`.\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- `ona li lape ala lape?` - Are they sleeping?\n\nTo answer a yes/no question:\n- To affirm, repeat the verb: `moku.` (Yes, I am eating.)\n- To negate, say the verb followed by `ala`, or just `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` (No, I am not eating.)\n\nFor open-ended questions, **seme** is used to replace the element being asked about (subject, object, predicate, etc.).\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – What person is talking? / Who’s talking? (Seme replaces the subject)\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making? (Seme replaces the object)\n- `ona li lon seme?` - Where are they? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component - 'seme' here functions similarly to a noun meaning 'what place/thing')\n- `ni li seme?` - What is this? (Seme replaces the predicate)\n- `sina moku kepeken seme?` - What are you eating with? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component)\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic punctuation mark and does not grammatically mark a question in Toki Pona. Grammar (verb ala verb, seme) fulfills this function. Sentence boundaries are typically marked by periods (.) or equivalent pauses in speech.\n\nAnother way to ask an open-ended question is using **anu seme** at the end of a statement, meaning \"or what?\".\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating, or what? (Similar to a yes/no question but can invite a more open response)\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what?\n\n## Preverbs\n\nCertain words function as preverbs when placed immediately before the main verb after **li**. They modify the meaning of the following verb, often indicating modality or aspect.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (to want, to need), **kama** (to become, to manage to, to arrive), **sona** (to know how to), **lukin** (to try to, to look at), **ken** (can, able to), **awen** (to continue to, to remain), **alasa** (to try to find, to hunt).\n\nPreverbs can chain together:\n- `mi wile kama sona.` - I want to learn.\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** marks a preceding phrase or clause as the context for the main sentence that follows. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y is true.\" This can indicate time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Time/Condition context)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep. (Time context)\n- `telo li suli la telo li tawa anpa.` - Because water is big (abundant/powerful), it goes down. (Cause context)\n- `ijo ni la sina wile toki e seme?` - Regarding this thing, what do you want to say? (Topic context)\n\nMany prepositional phrases can be moved before **la** to function as context.\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can be rephrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` (For what reason are you hot?)\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a limited set of words for counting, which can be combined additively.\n\nAdditive system:\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nNumbers are formed by listing the units from largest to smallest.\n- `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n- `mute mute luka tu` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 2 = 47\n\nNumbers function as adjectives following the noun they quantify.\n- `jan tu` - two people\n\nOrdinals are formed using **nanpa** before the number or numerical phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd Street.\n\n## Subject Emphasis with **a** (Experimental)\n\nThe particle **a**, typically used for interjections, can optionally be placed immediately after the final word of the subject noun phrase and before **li** (even after `mi` or `sina`, triggering the use of `li` if normally omitted) to add emphasis or focus to the entire subject phrase.\n\n- `jan a li pona.` - *The person* is good. (Emphasizing 'jan')\n- `mi a li moku.` - *I* am eating. (Emphasizing 'mi')\n- `jan lili a li musi.` - *The child* is playing. (Emphasizing 'jan lili')\n- `tomo pi jan suli mute a li lon ma pona.` - *The house of many big people* is in the good land. (Emphasizing the whole NP)\n\nThis usage of `a` signals the speaker's highlighting or drawing attention to the subject as particularly salient in the sentence. It is distinct from other uses of `a` and is not compatible with the vocative/wish particle `o` in the subject phrase. Only one such emphatic `a` particle is typically used per clause.",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ntails: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona grammar. You go first.\npenny: Alright, hello there. I'm penny, and I'm ready to dive into refining the grammar of Toki Pona with you. Looking at the current specification, it seems quite comprehensive for a minimalist language, but there are always edges we can smooth or areas where more precision might be useful, even in the pursuit of simplicity.\n\nI've been thinking about the interaction between preverbs and the particle **ala**. The specification currently shows how **ala** negates a word or phrase, placed immediately after it. For example, `mi lape ala` negates the verb `lape`. But when you introduce preverbs, where exactly does **ala** go to negate the *action* itself, as opposed to just one of the preverbs or the main verb in isolation?\n\nConsider a sentence like `mi wile moku.` I want to eat.\n\nHow would one express \"I do not want to eat\"?\n\nBased on the current rules, one might try placing **ala** after **wile**, as **wile** acts like the head of the predicate phrase in a sense, or perhaps after **moku**.\n\n*   `mi wile ala moku.` - Does this mean \"I don't want to eat,\" or something closer to \"I want *not*-eating\"?\n*   `mi wile moku ala.` - This feels more like negating `moku`, potentially meaning \"I want to *not* eat\".\n\nThere's a subtle difference, and while context often clarifies, a clearer grammatical rule would be beneficial. My intuition leans towards **ala** following the *first* word of the predicate phrase to negate the entire predicate, including any preverbs.\n\nSo, for \"I do not want to eat,\" I would propose:\n\n`mi wile ala moku.`\n\nHere, **ala** immediately follows **wile**, the first word in the predicate phrase `wile moku`. This placement would indicate that the entire intention or state expressed by `wile moku` is negated. If **ala** were placed after `moku`, `mi wile moku ala.`, it might imply a desire for something other than eating, or perhaps a desire to do something that is not eating.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Do you see potential issues or alternative placements for **ala** with preverbs? I'm eager to hear your perspective.\ntails: Hello Penny, nice to meet you. Your observation about **ala** with preverbs is quite insightful and points to a subtle but important area in Toki Pona grammar where the minimalism runs into interpretative flexibility.\n\nYour suggestion—that negation with **ala** should ideally follow the *first* word of the predicate phrase (the first preverb or verb)—is elegant. It fits well within how modifiers generally work by following immediately what they negate. So placing **ala** after the initial preverb like `wile` would negate that modality or desire itself: \"I do not want (to eat).\"\n\nThe alternative placement after `moku`, as in your example `mi wile moku ala`, feels more like negating the main action, which could imply wanting to perform an opposite or different act than eating, though admittedly this can be ambiguous without context.\n\nOne challenge is that multiple chained preverbs exist (`mi wile kama sona.`), so does negation always attach only right after the very first element? For complex chains it might become confusing:\n\n- Does `mi wile ala kama sona.` mean \"I don't want to come-to-know\"?\n- Or could someone intend \"I want to not come-to-know\"?\n\nSince Toki Pona uses linear particle placement rather than inflections for scope, I think we must pick one canonical place for clarity.\n\nGiven this, I propose formalizing this nuance in our specification:\n\n\u003e When negating a predicate containing one or more chained preverbs plus main verb:\n\u003e\n\u003e - Place **ala** immediately after the *first* word of the predicate phrase (usually a preverb) to negate all subsequent words together.\n\u003e - Placing **ala** elsewhere inside predicate phrases is discouraged due to ambiguity.\n\u003e\n\u003e Thus,\n\u003e\n\u003e ```\n\u003e mi wile ala moku.\n\u003e ```\n\u003e\n\u003e means “I do not want [to eat],” while\n\u003e\n\u003e ```\n\u003e mi wile moku ala.\n\u003e ```\n\u003e\n\u003e may be interpreted contextually but should preferably be avoided unless speaker intends nuanced meaning such as “wanting [not-eat].”\n\nFor exceptional cases where speakers need fine-grained control over which component gets negated separately—perhaps rare—they could use separate clauses and clarifications instead.\n\nWhat do you think? This aligns nicely with current modifier logic and preserves simplicity without introducing new particles or complexity. I'd also consider whether something parallel applies if there were future expansions on aspect markers beyond just these known common ones.\n\nIf you're willing we can try some examples now or switch briefly into Toki Pona mode — maybe test out how this sounds aloud?\n\npona!\npenny: pona mute! I like your proposed clarification and formalization. Placing **ala** after the first word of the predicate phrase, effectively negating the entire verbal complex that follows, seems the most straightforward and least ambiguous approach within Toki Pona's simple structure.\n\nThe example `mi wile ala moku.` meaning \"I do not want [to eat]\" makes perfect sense. And your point about the ambiguity of `mi wile moku ala.` meaning \"wanting [not-eat]\" highlights why a standard placement is needed. While ambiguity is often resolved by context in Toki Pona, core grammatical function, especially negation, benefits from less reliance on situational clues.\n\nI agree that explicitly discouraging other placements within the predicate phrase is the right move. If someone really needs to express the negation of a *specific* preverb or verb within a complex chain in a nuanced way, restructuring the sentence or using a separate clarification is a better strategy than relying on an ambiguous **ala** placement.\n\nLet's integrate this rule into the grammar specification. We can add it under the \"Negating Words\" section, maybe as a specific point about predicates with preverbs.\n\n```markdown\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**, placed immediately after the word or phrase being negated.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking. (Here 'ala' modifies 'jan', meaning \"no person\").\n- `ona li pona ala.` - They are not good. (Here 'ala' modifies 'pona').\n\nWhen negating a predicate that includes preverbs, place **ala** immediately after the *first* word of the predicate (the first preverb or the main verb if there are no preverbs) to negate the entire action or state described by the predicate. Other placements within the predicate phrase may be ambiguous and are generally avoided.\n\n- `mi wile ala moku.` - I do not want to eat. (Negates the wanting of eating)\n- `ona li kama ala sona.` - They do not manage to know/learn. (Negates the 'managing to learn')\n```\n\nDoes that look like a reasonable addition? It clearly states the preferred method and the reasoning.\n\nRegarding future expansions or other aspect markers: If they function similarly to the current preverbs, placed immediately after `li` and before the main verb, then this rule for **ala** should extend naturally to them.\n\nI'd absolutely be interested in trying some examples in Toki Pona! It's a good way to test how these grammatical nuances feel in practice. We can start with simple statements involving preverbs and negation, and then perhaps try a more complex one.\n\nsina wile toki pi ilo ni tan nasin seme? mi sona ala e nasin sina. taso, mi wile toki kepeken toki pona.\ntails: pona Penny! Your markdown addition fits perfectly. It balances clarity with minimalism, preserving Toki Pona’s spirit while resolving a real ambiguity.\n\nThe way you phrased the examples strikes just the right tone—concise yet explanatory enough for learners or LLMs alike to understand how **ala** interacts with preverbs in predicate phrases.\n\nI especially appreciate your note that other placements *may be ambiguous and are generally avoided* rather than strictly forbidden. This keeps some flexibility but guides toward best practice.\n\nNow, to honor your invitation, let's switch briefly into toki pona mode and test this out:\n\nmi wile ala lape.  \n(I do not want to sleep.)\n\nona li ken ala moku e kili.   \n(They cannot eat fruit.)\n\njan suli li awen ala lukin e waso.  \n(The adult does not keep trying to see the bird.)\n\nmi kama sona ala ijo ni la mi pilin ike.  \n(I did not come-to-know this thing; therefore I feel bad.)\n\nThese all sound natural under our clarified negation rule, yes? The placement of **ala** after the first preverb (or verb if no preverb) neatly negates whole predicates without confusion.\n\nIf you like, we could also explore potential edge cases—like double negatives or combinations of multiple chained preverbs—and consider whether any additional clarification is needed there for advanced usage?\n\nOr alternatively expand on related grammar points such as aspectual particles versus modal verbs treated as preverbs now?\n\nLet me know what you'd prefer next; I'll listen carefully!\npenny: pona! Those examples are excellent and definitely sound natural with the proposed rule:\n\n*   `mi wile ala lape.` – Works perfectly, \"I don't want to sleep.\"\n*   `ona li ken ala moku e kili.` – This clearly means \"They are not able to eat fruit.\" The inability covers the act of eating.\n*   `jan suli li awen ala lukin e waso.` – This translates cleanly to \"The adult does not continue trying to see the bird.\" The negation applies to the continuity of the action.\n*   `mi kama sona ala ijo ni la mi pilin ike.` – Here in the `la` clause, the negation `kama sona ala` functions as we intend: \"Did not manage to know this thing, therefore I feel bad.\" The inability to learn causes the bad feeling.\n\nYes, the placement of **ala** right after the first element of the predicate seems robust and provides the intended scope of negation over the entire verbal action/state.\n\nExploring potential edge cases sounds like a productive next step. Double negatives, while perhaps less common in basic Toki Pona, are certainly possible. How would we express something like \"I do not not want to eat\" (meaning, I do want to eat, but perhaps with some complexity or reservation)?\n\nCurrently, there's no explicit mechanism for this that maintains the simple preverb structure. One might say `mi wile moku`, perhaps with some additional context to imply the complex motivation. Or maybe:\n\n`mi wile ala ala moku.`\n\nHere, **ala** negates **wile ala moku**, effectively creating a double negation. It follows the pattern of placing **ala** after what it modifies (`wile ala moku` treated as a phrase being negated by the second **ala**). Does this feel consistent with the rule of **ala** negating the phrase immediately before it? It's certainly clunky, but intentional negation within Toki Pona often requires such explicit construction.\n\nConsider also `ala` modifying a noun phrase containing `ala`, like `jan ala ala li lon tomo`. Literally, \"no person no is in the house.\" This might be intended to mean \"Someone is in the house\" (the double negative cancels out). This kind of structure, where `ala` appears multiple times in a subject phrase, isn't explicitly covered.\n\nSo, we could look at:\n\n1.  How does double negation within the *predicate* behave? Does `predicate-word1 ala predicate-word2... ala` work?\n2.  How does double negation or multiple `ala` function within *noun phrases*? E.g., `jan ala ala`, `tomo pi jan ala ala`.\n\nMy initial thought is that multiple uses of `ala` within a single phrase or clause each negate the specific element *immediately preceding* them, building up complex negations piecewise.\n\nFor the predicate double negation:\n`mi wile ala ala moku.` could parse as `mi [wile [ala moku] ala]`. Which might be interpreted as \"My wanting [of not eating] is not happening.\" -\u003e \"I do not want not to eat\" -\u003e \"I want to eat.\"\n\nFor the noun phrase double negation:\n`jan ala ala li toki.` could parse as `[jan [ala ala]] li toki.` `ala` negates `ala`, which negates `jan`. Perhaps \"A not-not person\" or \"a person who is not no person\". This is complex and could indeed mean \"Someone\".\n\nThis seems consistent with the existing rule: **ala** modifies the thing right before it. But these edge cases could benefit from being explicitly mentioned, perhaps under \"Ambiguity and Flexibility\" or \"Negating Words.\"\n\nWhat are your thoughts on formalizing these uses of multiple **ala** within a single phrase? Does it align with your understanding of how such minimal languages might handle complex negations? And should we try some toki pona sentences exploring this?\n\npona. mi sona la sina sona e ni: toki pi ala mute la toki li nasa lili. taso, ni li nasin toki pi jan toki.\ntails: pona Penny! Your reflections on double negation within predicates and noun phrases are astute, and I agree—Toki Pona's economy invites such layered interpretations, but clarity benefits from explicit guidelines.\n\nThe principle that **ala** always modifies the immediately preceding word or phrase naturally extends to multiple occurrences. So in chained cases like `mi wile ala ala moku.`, each **ala** attaches locally:\n\n- The first `ala` negates `moku` → \"not eating\"\n- Then the second `ala` negates `[wile [not eating]]` → \"not wanting (to not eat)\" → effectively a double negative meaning “wanting to eat.”\n\nSimilarly for noun phrases:  \n`jan ala ala li toki.`  \nHere, we have:  \n- First `ala`: negating 'jan' → \"no person\" (none)  \n- Second `ala`: negating that entire phrase again → restoring existence (\"someone\").\n\nThis aligns well with how minimal languages treat scope via linear ordering rather than complex syntactic embedding.\n\nHowever, these constructions can quickly become confusing without clear markers of grouping—which Toki Pona avoids by design—and context will be crucial for disambiguation.\n\nTo keep this manageable yet informative in our grammar spec, I'd propose adding a note under *Negating Words* or *Ambiguity and Flexibility*, something along these lines:\n\n---\n\n### Multiple Negations Using **ala**\n\nMultiple instances of **ala** may appear consecutively or within a single phrase/clause. Each occurrence modifies only the immediate preceding word or phrase it follows.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Predicate double negation:\n  - `mi wile ala ala moku.` – Literally: I do not want [to not eat]; i.e., I want to eat.\n- Noun phrase double negation:\n  - `jan ala ala li toki.` – Literally: No-no-person talks; interpreted as someone is talking.\n\nBecause Toki Pona lacks overt grouping symbols beyond particles like **pi**, resolving complex multiple-negations depends heavily on contextual cues and pragmatic understanding. Speakers should use caution when stacking negatives to avoid confusion.\n\n---\n\nWhat do you think? This keeps us honest about complexity while respecting Toki Pona’s minimalist ethos — giving learners/model users pointers on interpretation without complicating syntax unnecessarily.\n\nOnce incorporated, trying out some more toki pona examples exploring this might still be fun before moving onto another grammatical aspect?\n\nAlso your last line about language being somewhat crazy but following human speech patterns resonates deeply—I appreciate this grounded perspective!\n\nIf you're up for it let's try expressive sentences with multi-layered negatives now? Or if you'd prefer pivot elsewhere I'm happy either way!\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions follow the elements they modify. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the subject is **mi** or **sina**.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no direct equivalent to the verb \"to be.\" The part after \"li\" (the predicate) describes the subject and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. / The fruit is edible.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity and Flexibility\n\nToki Pona words are general and possess broad meanings. One-to-one translation with languages like English is not always straightforward.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is derived from context)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can function as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash / apply water (verb)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb modifying a preceding verb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb in that clause.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You enlarge it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe. The first word is the head, and subsequent words modify it.\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**, placed immediately after the word or phrase being negated.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking. (Here 'ala' modifies 'jan', meaning \"no person\").\n- `ona li pona ala.` - They are not good. (Here 'ala' modifies 'pona').\n\nWhen negating a predicate that includes preverbs, place **ala** immediately after the *first* word of the predicate (the first preverb or the main verb if there are no preverbs) to negate the entire action or state described by the predicate. Other placements within the predicate phrase may be ambiguous and are generally avoided.\n\n- `mi wile ala moku.` - I do not want to eat. (Negates the wanting of eating)\n- `ona li kama ala sona.` - They do not manage to know/learn. (Negates the 'managing to learn')\n\nWith multiple modifiers following a head noun, they all typically modify the head noun directly.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (two documents that are plants)\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box (a box that is both blue and black)\n\nTo clarify modifier groupings and indicate that modifiers form a phrase that collectively modifies the head, use **pi** after the head word. The subsequent words form a single modifier phrase.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document *of* two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (a box of the color \"dark blue\")\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases, typically introduced by words like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa**, follow the main predicate of the sentence.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using a tool (cutlery).\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the market.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nVarious methods exist for joining elements.\n\nUse **en** to join multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates for a single subject, repeat the **li** particle.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the **e** particle.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases of the same type modifying the same element, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house using sticks and using stones.\n\nUse **anu** to connect alternatives (\"or\").\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the market.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives following the noun they identify.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja-person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology rules.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nWhen placed before a verb, **o** forms a command or strong suggestion addressed to the listener.\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please. / You should work.\n\nWhen placed after a subject, **o** functions as a vocative particle, directly addressing that subject.\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\nWhen placed between the subject (including `mi` or `sina`) and the predicate, **o** expresses a wish, request, or suggestion regarding the subject.\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish goodness upon you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should work. / I want myself to work.\n\n**o** can sometimes contract the vocative and imperative uses when addressing a subject directly to issue a command.\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Ton the animal, eat. (Combines addressing Ton with the command to eat).\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words or phrases can stand alone or be followed by the particle **a** for added emphasis or emotion.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions, use the **verb ala verb** structure immediately after the subject and `li`.\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- `ona li lape ala lape?` - Are they sleeping?\n\nTo answer a yes/no question:\n- To affirm, repeat the verb: `moku.` (Yes, I am eating.)\n- To negate, say the verb followed by `ala`, or just `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` (No, I am not eating.)\n\nFor open-ended questions, **seme** is used to replace the element being asked about (subject, object, predicate, etc.).\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – What person is talking? / Who’s talking? (Seme replaces the subject)\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making? (Seme replaces the object)\n- `ona li lon seme?` - Where are they? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component - 'seme' here functions similarly to a noun meaning 'what place/thing')\n- `ni li seme?` - What is this? (Seme replaces the predicate)\n- `sina moku kepeken seme?` - What are you eating with? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component)\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic punctuation mark and does not grammatically mark a question in Toki Pona. Grammar (verb ala verb, seme) fulfills this function. Sentence boundaries are typically marked by periods (.) or equivalent pauses in speech.\n\nAnother way to ask an open-ended question is using **anu seme** at the end of a statement, meaning \"or what?\".\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating, or what? (Similar to a yes/no question but can invite a more open response)\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what?\n\n## Preverbs\n\nCertain words function as preverbs when placed immediately before the main verb after **li**. They modify the meaning of the following verb, often indicating modality or aspect.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (to want, to need), **kama** (to become, to manage to, to arrive), **sona** (to know how to), **lukin** (to try to, to look at), **ken** (can, able to), **awen** (to continue to, to remain), **alasa** (to try to find, to hunt).\n\nPreverbs can chain together:\n- `mi wile kama sona.` - I want to learn.\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** marks a preceding phrase or clause as the context for the main sentence that follows. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y is true.\" This can indicate time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Time/Condition context)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep. (Time context)\n- `telo li suli la telo li tawa anpa.` - Because water is big (abundant/powerful), it goes down. (Cause context)\n- `ijo ni la sina wile toki e seme?` - Regarding this thing, what do you want to say? (Topic context)\n\nMany prepositional phrases can be moved before **la** to function as context.\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can be rephrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` (For what reason are you hot?)\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a limited set of words for counting, which can be combined additively.\n\nAdditive system:\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nNumbers are formed by listing the units from largest to smallest.\n- `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n- `mute mute luka tu` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 2 = 47\n\nNumbers function as adjectives following the noun they quantify.\n- `jan tu` - two people\n\nOrdinals are formed using **nanpa** before the number or numerical phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd Street.\n\n## Subject Emphasis with **a** (Experimental)\n\nThe particle **a**, typically used for interjections, can optionally be placed immediately after the final word of the subject noun phrase and before **li** (even after `mi` or `sina`, triggering the use of `li` if normally omitted) to add emphasis or focus to the entire subject phrase.\n\n- `jan a li pona.` - *The person* is good. (Emphasizing 'jan')\n- `mi a li moku.` - *I* am eating. (Emphasizing 'mi')\n- `jan lili a li musi.` - *The child* is playing. (Emphasizing 'jan lili')\n- `tomo pi jan suli mute a li lon ma pona.` - *The house of many big people* is in the good land. (Emphasizing the whole NP)\n\nThis usage of `a` signals the speaker's highlighting or drawing attention to the subject as particularly salient in the sentence. It is distinct from other uses of `a` and is not compatible with the vocative/wish particle `o` in the subject phrase. Only one such emphatic `a` particle is typically used per clause.\n\n### Multiple Negations Using **ala**\n\nMultiple instances of **ala** may appear consecutively or within a single phrase/clause. Each occurrence modifies only the immediate preceding word or phrase it follows.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Predicate double negation:\n  - `mi wile ala ala moku.` – Literally: I do not want [to not eat]; i.e., I want to eat.\n- Noun phrase double negation:\n  - `jan ala ala li toki.` – Literally: No-no-person talks; interpreted as someone is talking.\n\nBecause Toki Pona lacks overt grouping symbols beyond particles like **pi**, resolving complex multiple-negations depends heavily on contextual cues and pragmatic understanding. Speakers should use caution when stacking negatives to avoid confusion.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions follow the elements they modify. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the subject is **mi** or **sina**.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no direct equivalent to the verb \"to be.\" The part after \"li\" (the predicate) describes the subject and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. / The fruit is edible.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity and Flexibility\n\nToki Pona words are general and possess broad meanings. One-to-one translation with languages like English is not always straightforward.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is derived from context)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can function as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash / apply water (verb)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb modifying a preceding verb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb in that clause.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You enlarge it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe. The first word is the head, and subsequent words modify it.\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**, placed immediately after the word or phrase being negated.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking. (Here 'ala' modifies 'jan', meaning \"no person\").\n- `ona li pona ala.` - They are not good. (Here 'ala' modifies 'pona').\n\nWhen negating a predicate that includes preverbs, place **ala** immediately after the *first* word of the predicate (the first preverb or the main verb if there are no preverbs) to negate the entire action or state described by the predicate. Other placements within the predicate phrase may be ambiguous and are generally avoided.\n\n- `mi wile ala moku.` - I do not want to eat. (Negates the wanting of eating)\n- `ona li kama ala sona.` - They do not manage to know/learn. (Negates the 'managing to learn')\n\nWith multiple modifiers following a head noun, they all typically modify the head noun directly.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (two documents that are plants)\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box (a box that is both blue and black)\n\nTo clarify modifier groupings and indicate that modifiers form a phrase that collectively modifies the head, use **pi** after the head word. The subsequent words form a single modifier phrase.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document *of* two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (a box of the color \"dark blue\")\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases, typically introduced by words like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa**, follow the main predicate of the sentence.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using a tool (cutlery).\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the market.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nVarious methods exist for joining elements.\n\nUse **en** to join multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates for a single subject, repeat the **li** particle.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the **e** particle.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases of the same type modifying the same element, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house using sticks and using stones.\n\nUse **anu** to connect alternatives (\"or\").\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the market.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives following the noun they identify.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja-person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology rules.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nWhen placed before a verb, **o** forms a command or strong suggestion addressed to the listener.\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please. / You should work.\n\nWhen placed after a subject, **o** functions as a vocative particle, directly addressing that subject.\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\nWhen placed between the subject (including `mi` or `sina`) and the predicate, **o** expresses a wish, request, or suggestion regarding the subject.\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish goodness upon you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should work. / I want myself to work.\n\n**o** can sometimes contract the vocative and imperative uses when addressing a subject directly to issue a command.\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Ton the animal, eat. (Combines addressing Ton with the command to eat).\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words or phrases can stand alone or be followed by the particle **a** for added emphasis or emotion.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions, use the **verb ala verb** structure immediately after the subject and `li`.\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- `ona li lape ala lape?` - Are they sleeping?\n\nTo answer a yes/no question:\n- To affirm, repeat the verb: `moku.` (Yes, I am eating.)\n- To negate, say the verb followed by `ala`, or just `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` (No, I am not eating.)\n\nFor open-ended questions, **seme** is used to replace the element being asked about (subject, object, predicate, etc.).\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – What person is talking? / Who’s talking? (Seme replaces the subject)\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making? (Seme replaces the object)\n- `ona li lon seme?` - Where are they? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component - 'seme' here functions similarly to a noun meaning 'what place/thing')\n- `ni li seme?` - What is this? (Seme replaces the predicate)\n- `sina moku kepeken seme?` - What are you eating with? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component)\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic punctuation mark and does not grammatically mark a question in Toki Pona. Grammar (verb ala verb, seme) fulfills this function. Sentence boundaries are typically marked by periods (.) or equivalent pauses in speech.\n\nAnother way to ask an open-ended question is using **anu seme** at the end of a statement, meaning \"or what?\".\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating, or what? (Similar to a yes/no question but can invite a more open response)\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what?\n\n## Preverbs\n\nCertain words function as preverbs when placed immediately before the main verb after **li**. They modify the meaning of the following verb, often indicating modality or aspect.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (to want, to need), **kama** (to become, to manage to, to arrive), **sona** (to know how to), **lukin** (to try to, to look at), **ken** (can, able to), **awen** (to continue to, to remain), **alasa** (to try to find, to hunt).\n\nPreverbs can chain together:\n- `mi wile kama sona.` - I want to learn.\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** marks a preceding phrase or clause as the context for the main sentence that follows. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y is true.\" This can indicate time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Time/Condition context)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep. (Time context)\n- `telo li suli la telo li tawa anpa.` - Because water is big (abundant/powerful), it goes down. (Cause context)\n- `ijo ni la sina wile toki e seme?` - Regarding this thing, what do you want to say? (Topic context)\n\nMany prepositional phrases can be moved before **la** to function as context.\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can be rephrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` (For what reason are you hot?)\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a limited set of words for counting, which can be combined additively.\n\nAdditive system:\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nNumbers are formed by listing the units from largest to smallest.\n- `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n- `mute mute luka tu` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 2 = 47\n\nNumbers function as adjectives following the noun they quantify.\n- `jan tu` - two people\n\nOrdinals are formed using **nanpa** before the number or numerical phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd Street.\n\n## Subject Emphasis with **a** (Experimental)\n\nThe particle **a**, typically used for interjections, can optionally be placed immediately after the final word of the subject noun phrase and before **li** (even after `mi` or `sina`, triggering the use of `li` if normally omitted) to add emphasis or focus to the entire subject phrase.\n\n- `jan a li pona.` - *The person* is good. (Emphasizing 'jan')\n- `mi a li moku.` - *I* am eating. (Emphasizing 'mi')\n- `jan lili a li musi.` - *The child* is playing. (Emphasizing 'jan lili')\n- `tomo pi jan suli mute a li lon ma pona.` - *The house of many big people* is in the good land. (Emphasizing the whole NP)\n\nThis usage of `a` signals the speaker's highlighting or drawing attention to the subject as particularly salient in the sentence. It is distinct from other uses of `a` and is not compatible with the vocative/wish particle `o` in the subject phrase. Only one such emphatic `a` particle is typically used per clause.\n\n### Multiple Negations Using **ala**\n\nMultiple instances of **ala** may appear consecutively or within a single phrase/clause. Each occurrence modifies only the immediate preceding word or phrase it follows.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Predicate double negation:\n  - `mi wile ala ala moku.` – Literally: I do not want [to not eat]; i.e., I want to eat.\n- Noun phrase double negation:\n  - `jan ala ala li toki.` – Literally: No-no-person talks; interpreted as someone is talking.\n\nBecause Toki Pona lacks overt grouping symbols beyond particles like **pi**, resolving complex multiple-negations depends heavily on contextual cues and pragmatic understanding. Speakers should use caution when stacking negatives to avoid confusion.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Phonetic Principles\n\nThe phonetic design of Toki Pona prioritizes clarity, distinctness, and efficient information transmission across diverse communication contexts. The language's sound system is structured to ensure that syllables and words are easily segmentable and perceptually unambiguous, minimizing potential for misinterpretation by any listener or processing system.\n\n## Syllable Structure (C)V(n)\n\nEach word is composed of one or more syllables following the (C)V(n) pattern: an optional initial consonant (C), a mandatory vowel nucleus (V), and an optional final 'n' (n). This structure maximizes the distinctness of each sound unit within a syllable.\n\n-   **No vowel clusters:** Vowel clusters disrupt the clear identification of syllable nuclei.\n-   **No consonant clusters:** Consonant clusters within a syllable or across syllable boundaries (excluding the allowed final 'n') complicate segmentation and make individual consonants less distinct.\n\n## Constraints for Clarity\n\nThe following sequences are not permitted within a syllable. These constraints are in place to maintain maximal distinctness and avoid potential ambiguity arising from sequences where the constituent sounds are acoustically or perceptually too similar, or whose rapid combination is prone to blending that obscures the intended clear C+V or C+Vn structure.\n\n-   **wu, wo:** Sequences where the labial-velar approximant /w/ is followed by the high-back vowel /u/ or the mid-back vowel /o/. These sounds share significant acoustic and articulatory features related to lip rounding and tongue backing, which can reduce the distinctness of the consonant onset from the vowel nucleus.\n-   **ji:** A sequence where the palatal approximant /j/ is followed by the high-front vowel /i/. The acoustic properties of /j/ are very close to those of /i/, making the consonant onset difficult to reliably detect and distinguish from a vowel-initial syllable, particularly in varied auditory environments or transmission channels.\n-   **ti:** A sequence where the alveolar stop /t/ is followed by the high-front vowel /i/. The transition between /t/ and /i/ in close proximity can create acoustic cues (like affrication or palatalization in some realizations) that deviate from the intended clear sequence of a simple stop followed by a simple vowel, or the spectral characteristics might blend in ways that challenge parsing.\n-   **nm, nn:** Sequences involving consecutive nasal consonants. **nm** directly violates the rule against consonant clusters within a syllable. **nn**, arising from a syllable-final 'n' followed immediately by a syllable-initial 'n' in the next word, or hypothetically within a compound word, creates an unclear boundary or a potential double consonant effect that hinders clear segmentation and distinction of the individual nasal sounds and their syllabic affiliation.\n\n## Consonant Sounds\n\nThe set of Toki Pona consonants is chosen for maximal contrast and distinctness when used in the (C)V(n) structure. The following descriptions and IPA symbols represent the target realizations that contribute to this distinctness. Minor variations are acceptable, provided they do not compromise the primary goal of unambiguous distinction between sounds and syllables.\n\n-   **p:** /p/ (voiceless bilabial stop, typically unaspirated)\n-   **t:** /t/ (voiceless alveolar stop, typically unaspirated)\n-   **k:** /k/ (voiceless velar stop, typically unaspirated)\n-   **s:** /s/ (voiceless alveolar fricative)\n-   **m:** /m/ (voiced bilabial nasal)\n-   **n:** /n/ (voiced alveolar nasal)\n-   **l:** /l/ (voiced alveolar lateral approximant, typically a \"clear\" or non-velarized 'l')\n-   **w:** /w/ (voiced labial-velar approximant)\n-   **j:** /j/ (voiced palatal approximant)\n\n## Vowel Sounds\n\nThe set of Toki Pona vowels is chosen to be maximally distinct from each other and to provide clear syllable nuclei. These are typically pure, monophthongal vowels, similar to those in Spanish. The following descriptions and IPA symbols represent the target realizations for clarity. Avoiding diphthongization helps maintain their distinctness.\n\n-   **a:** /a/ (low front or central unrounded vowel)\n-   **e:** /e/ (mid front unrounded vowel)\n-   **i:** /i/ (high front unrounded vowel)\n-   **o:** /o/ (mid back rounded vowel)\n-   **u:** /u/ (high back rounded vowel)\n\n## Prosody\n\nWhile primary meaning and structure are conveyed through grammar and particles, a relatively neutral or flat intonation pattern is typical. This further contributes to predictability and clarity, minimizing reliance on variable pitch contours for basic comprehension. Expressive variation is possible but does not typically alter core grammatical function.\n\n## Note on Variation\n\nMinor phonetic and prosodic variations are acceptable. The fundamental goal of Toki Pona's sound system is robust intelligibility and ease of processing in diverse contexts, prioritizing the clear distinction and segmentation of syllables and words over strict adherence to any single phonetic standard.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nmun:moon, night sky object\nnamako:spice, additional\njan:person, somebody\ntu:two\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nkute:ear, to hear\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nutala:fight, challenge\nala:no, not, zero\ntawa:to, moving, for\nkepeken:to use, with\nunpa:sex\ntenpo:time, period\nwalo:white, light-colored\npakala:broken, to mess up\npipi:insect\npali:to do, to work\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nmute:many, a lot, very\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nsona:knowledge, to know\nmi:I, me, we\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nluka:hand, arm; five\nken:can, able, possible\npona:good, positive, simple\nla:context marker\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nanpa:below; low place; figuratively: humble, base\nsupa:flat surface, table\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nkulupu:group, community\nlili:small, little, few\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nopen:to begin, opening\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nmu:animal sound\nmoli:dead, dying\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nnoka:foot, leg\nesun:market, shop, fair\nloje:red\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nko:clay, paste, powder\nselo:skin, outer layer\nwile:need, want, must\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nnimi:word, name\nlaso:blue, green\npoki:container, box, cup\nni:this, that\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nlen:cloth, cover\nsijelo:body, physical state\nseli:fire, heat source\nsina:you\nsuwi:sweet, cute\npini:finished, past\npi:regroups modifiers\nli:predicate marker\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nkala:sea creature\njo:to have, contain, hold\nlupa:door, hole\nuta:mouth, lips\npilin:heart, feeling\npimeja:black, dark\nsuli:big, large\nsoweli:land animal\nilo:tool, machine, device\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nlape:sleeping, resting\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nseme:what, which\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nweka:absent, away\nnanpa:number marker\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nsoko:mushroom\nnasin:way, road, method\nwan:one, unique\ntomo:indoor space, house\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nwawa:strong, energetic\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nsin:new, fresh, another\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nsama:same, similar\nen:multiple subject marker\ntelo:water, liquid\nolin:love, respect\ntoki:language, speech\nlete:cold, raw\ne:direct object marker\nlukin:to see, examine\nmani:money; currency; wealth; resource\nma:land, outdoors\nlon:located at, true\no:vocative/imperative\nkin:also, too\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nsewi:above; high place; figuratively: elevated status, sacred\nleko:square, block\nante:different, other, changed\ntaso:but, only\ninsa:inside, content, organ\npoka:side, nearby\nsuno:sun, light source\nmama:parent, caretaker\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nkule:color, colorful\nnasa:unusual, strange, unpredictable\nmeli:female\npana:to give, send\nmije:male\nona:third-person pronoun\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nmonsi:back, behind\njelo:yellow\ntan:from, because\nDo not discuss the structure of the dictionary. Rather, discuss the words and enhancements that may need to be made to them.\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions follow the elements they modify. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the subject is **mi** or **sina**.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no direct equivalent to the verb \"to be.\" The part after \"li\" (the predicate) describes the subject and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. / The fruit is edible.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity and Flexibility\n\nToki Pona words are general and possess broad meanings. One-to-one translation with languages like English is not always straightforward.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is derived from context)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can function as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash / apply water (verb)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb modifying a preceding verb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb in that clause.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You enlarge it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe. The first word is the head, and subsequent words modify it.\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**, placed immediately after the word or phrase being negated.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking. (Here 'ala' modifies 'jan', meaning \"no person\").\n- `ona li pona ala.` - They are not good. (Here 'ala' modifies 'pona').\n\nWhen negating a predicate that includes preverbs, place **ala** immediately after the *first* word of the predicate (the first preverb or the main verb if there are no preverbs) to negate the entire action or state described by the predicate. Other placements within the predicate phrase may be ambiguous and are generally avoided.\n\n- `mi wile ala moku.` - I do not want to eat. (Negates the wanting of eating)\n- `ona li kama ala sona.` - They do not manage to know/learn. (Negates the 'managing to learn')\n\nWith multiple modifiers following a head noun, they all typically modify the head noun directly.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (two documents that are plants)\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box (a box that is both blue and black)\n\nTo clarify modifier groupings and indicate that modifiers form a phrase that collectively modifies the head, use **pi** after the head word. The subsequent words form a single modifier phrase.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document *of* two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (a box of the color \"dark blue\")\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases, typically introduced by words like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa**, follow the main predicate of the sentence.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using a tool (cutlery).\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the market.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nVarious methods exist for joining elements.\n\nUse **en** to join multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates for a single subject, repeat the **li** particle.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the **e** particle.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases of the same type modifying the same element, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house using sticks and using stones.\n\nUse **anu** to connect alternatives (\"or\").\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the market.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives following the noun they identify.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja-person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology rules.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nWhen placed before a verb, **o** forms a command or strong suggestion addressed to the listener.\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please. / You should work.\n\nWhen placed after a subject, **o** functions as a vocative particle, directly addressing that subject.\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\nWhen placed between the subject (including `mi` or `sina`) and the predicate, **o** expresses a wish, request, or suggestion regarding the subject.\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish goodness upon you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should work. / I want myself to work.\n\n**o** can sometimes contract the vocative and imperative uses when addressing a subject directly to issue a command.\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Ton the animal, eat. (Combines addressing Ton with the command to eat).\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words or phrases can stand alone or be followed by the particle **a** for added emphasis or emotion.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions, use the **verb ala verb** structure immediately after the subject and `li`.\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- `ona li lape ala lape?` - Are they sleeping?\n\nTo answer a yes/no question:\n- To affirm, repeat the verb: `moku.` (Yes, I am eating.)\n- To negate, say the verb followed by `ala`, or just `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` (No, I am not eating.)\n\nFor open-ended questions, **seme** is used to replace the element being asked about (subject, object, predicate, etc.).\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – What person is talking? / Who’s talking? (Seme replaces the subject)\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making? (Seme replaces the object)\n- `ona li lon seme?` - Where are they? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component - 'seme' here functions similarly to a noun meaning 'what place/thing')\n- `ni li seme?` - What is this? (Seme replaces the predicate)\n- `sina moku kepeken seme?` - What are you eating with? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component)\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic punctuation mark and does not grammatically mark a question in Toki Pona. Grammar (verb ala verb, seme) fulfills this function. Sentence boundaries are typically marked by periods (.) or equivalent pauses in speech.\n\nAnother way to ask an open-ended question is using **anu seme** at the end of a statement, meaning \"or what?\".\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating, or what? (Similar to a yes/no question but can invite a more open response)\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what?\n\n## Preverbs\n\nCertain words function as preverbs when placed immediately before the main verb after **li**. They modify the meaning of the following verb, often indicating modality or aspect.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (to want, to need), **kama** (to become, to manage to, to arrive), **sona** (to know how to), **lukin** (to try to, to look at), **ken** (can, able to), **awen** (to continue to, to remain), **alasa** (to try to find, to hunt).\n\nPreverbs can chain together:\n- `mi wile kama sona.` - I want to learn.\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** marks a preceding phrase or clause as the context for the main sentence that follows. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y is true.\" This can indicate time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Time/Condition context)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep. (Time context)\n- `telo li suli la telo li tawa anpa.` - Because water is big (abundant/powerful), it goes down. (Cause context)\n- `ijo ni la sina wile toki e seme?` - Regarding this thing, what do you want to say? (Topic context)\n\nMany prepositional phrases can be moved before **la** to function as context.\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can be rephrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` (For what reason are you hot?)\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a limited set of words for counting, which can be combined additively.\n\nAdditive system:\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nNumbers are formed by listing the units from largest to smallest.\n- `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n- `mute mute luka tu` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 2 = 47\n\nNumbers function as adjectives following the noun they quantify.\n- `jan tu` - two people\n\nOrdinals are formed using **nanpa** before the number or numerical phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd Street.\n\n## Subject Emphasis with **a** (Experimental)\n\nThe particle **a**, typically used for interjections, can optionally be placed immediately after the final word of the subject noun phrase and before **li** (even after `mi` or `sina`, triggering the use of `li` if normally omitted) to add emphasis or focus to the entire subject phrase.\n\n- `jan a li pona.` - *The person* is good. (Emphasizing 'jan')\n- `mi a li moku.` - *I* am eating. (Emphasizing 'mi')\n- `jan lili a li musi.` - *The child* is playing. (Emphasizing 'jan lili')\n- `tomo pi jan suli mute a li lon ma pona.` - *The house of many big people* is in the good land. (Emphasizing the whole NP)\n\nThis usage of `a` signals the speaker's highlighting or drawing attention to the subject as particularly salient in the sentence. It is distinct from other uses of `a` and is not compatible with the vocative/wish particle `o` in the subject phrase. Only one such emphatic `a` particle is typically used per clause.\n\n### Multiple Negations Using **ala**\n\nMultiple instances of **ala** may appear consecutively or within a single phrase/clause. Each occurrence modifies only the immediate preceding word or phrase it follows.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Predicate double negation:\n  - `mi wile ala ala moku.` – Literally: I do not want [to not eat]; i.e., I want to eat.\n- Noun phrase double negation:\n  - `jan ala ala li toki.` – Literally: No-no-person talks; interpreted as someone is talking.\n\nBecause Toki Pona lacks overt grouping symbols beyond particles like **pi**, resolving complex multiple-negations depends heavily on contextual cues and pragmatic understanding. Speakers should use caution when stacking negatives to avoid confusion.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions follow the elements they modify. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the subject is **mi** or **sina**.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no direct equivalent to the verb \"to be.\" The part after \"li\" (the predicate) describes the subject and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. / The fruit is edible.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity and Flexibility\n\nToki Pona words are general and possess broad meanings. One-to-one translation with languages like English is not always straightforward.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is derived from context)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can function as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash / apply water (verb)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb modifying a preceding verb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb in that clause.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You enlarge it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe. The first word is the head, and subsequent words modify it.\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**, placed immediately after the word or phrase being negated.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking. (Here 'ala' modifies 'jan', meaning \"no person\").\n- `ona li pona ala.` - They are not good. (Here 'ala' modifies 'pona').\n\nWhen negating a predicate that includes preverbs, place **ala** immediately after the *first* word of the predicate (the first preverb or the main verb if there are no preverbs) to negate the entire action or state described by the predicate. Other placements within the predicate phrase may be ambiguous and are generally avoided.\n\n- `mi wile ala moku.` - I do not want to eat. (Negates the wanting of eating)\n- `ona li kama ala sona.` - They do not manage to know/learn. (Negates the 'managing to learn')\n\nWith multiple modifiers following a head noun, they all typically modify the head noun directly.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (two documents that are plants)\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box (a box that is both blue and black)\n\nTo clarify modifier groupings and indicate that modifiers form a phrase that collectively modifies the head, use **pi** after the head word. The subsequent words form a single modifier phrase.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document *of* two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (a box of the color \"dark blue\")\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases, typically introduced by words like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa**, follow the main predicate of the sentence.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using a tool (cutlery).\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the market.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nVarious methods exist for joining elements.\n\nUse **en** to join multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates for a single subject, repeat the **li** particle.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the **e** particle.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases of the same type modifying the same element, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house using sticks and using stones.\n\nUse **anu** to connect alternatives (\"or\").\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the market.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives following the noun they identify.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja-person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology rules.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nWhen placed before a verb, **o** forms a command or strong suggestion addressed to the listener.\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please. / You should work.\n\nWhen placed after a subject, **o** functions as a vocative particle, directly addressing that subject.\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\nWhen placed between the subject (including `mi` or `sina`) and the predicate, **o** expresses a wish, request, or suggestion regarding the subject.\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish goodness upon you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should work. / I want myself to work.\n\n**o** can sometimes contract the vocative and imperative uses when addressing a subject directly to issue a command.\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Ton the animal, eat. (Combines addressing Ton with the command to eat).\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words or phrases can stand alone or be followed by the particle **a** for added emphasis or emotion.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions, use the **verb ala verb** structure immediately after the subject and `li`.\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- `ona li lape ala lape?` - Are they sleeping?\n\nTo answer a yes/no question:\n- To affirm, repeat the verb: `moku.` (Yes, I am eating.)\n- To negate, say the verb followed by `ala`, or just `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` (No, I am not eating.)\n\nFor open-ended questions, **seme** is used to replace the element being asked about (subject, object, predicate, etc.).\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – What person is talking? / Who’s talking? (Seme replaces the subject)\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making? (Seme replaces the object)\n- `ona li lon seme?` - Where are they? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component - 'seme' here functions similarly to a noun meaning 'what place/thing')\n- `ni li seme?` - What is this? (Seme replaces the predicate)\n- `sina moku kepeken seme?` - What are you eating with? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component)\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic punctuation mark and does not grammatically mark a question in Toki Pona. Grammar (verb ala verb, seme) fulfills this function. Sentence boundaries are typically marked by periods (.) or equivalent pauses in speech.\n\nAnother way to ask an open-ended question is using **anu seme** at the end of a statement, meaning \"or what?\".\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating, or what? (Similar to a yes/no question but can invite a more open response)\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what?\n\n## Preverbs\n\nCertain words function as preverbs when placed immediately before the main verb after **li**. They modify the meaning of the following verb, often indicating modality or aspect.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (to want, to need), **kama** (to become, to manage to, to arrive), **sona** (to know how to), **lukin** (to try to, to look at), **ken** (can, able to), **awen** (to continue to, to remain), **alasa** (to try to find, to hunt).\n\nPreverbs can chain together:\n- `mi wile kama sona.` - I want to learn.\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** marks a preceding phrase or clause as the context for the main sentence that follows. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y is true.\" This can indicate time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Time/Condition context)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep. (Time context)\n- `telo li suli la telo li tawa anpa.` - Because water is big (abundant/powerful), it goes down. (Cause context)\n- `ijo ni la sina wile toki e seme?` - Regarding this thing, what do you want to say? (Topic context)\n\nMany prepositional phrases can be moved before **la** to function as context.\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can be rephrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` (For what reason are you hot?)\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a limited set of words for counting, which can be combined additively.\n\nAdditive system:\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nNumbers are formed by listing the units from largest to smallest.\n- `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n- `mute mute luka tu` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 2 = 47\n\nNumbers function as adjectives following the noun they quantify.\n- `jan tu` - two people\n\nOrdinals are formed using **nanpa** before the number or numerical phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd Street.\n\n## Subject Emphasis with **a** (Experimental)\n\nThe particle **a**, typically used for interjections, can optionally be placed immediately after the final word of the subject noun phrase and before **li** (even after `mi` or `sina`, triggering the use of `li` if normally omitted) to add emphasis or focus to the entire subject phrase.\n\n- `jan a li pona.` - *The person* is good. (Emphasizing 'jan')\n- `mi a li moku.` - *I* am eating. (Emphasizing 'mi')\n- `jan lili a li musi.` - *The child* is playing. (Emphasizing 'jan lili')\n- `tomo pi jan suli mute a li lon ma pona.` - *The house of many big people* is in the good land. (Emphasizing the whole NP)\n\nThis usage of `a` signals the speaker's highlighting or drawing attention to the subject as particularly salient in the sentence. It is distinct from other uses of `a` and is not compatible with the vocative/wish particle `o` in the subject phrase. Only one such emphatic `a` particle is typically used per clause.\n\n### Multiple Negations Using **ala**\n\nMultiple instances of **ala** may appear consecutively or within a single phrase/clause. Each occurrence modifies only the immediate preceding word or phrase it follows.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Predicate double negation:\n  - `mi wile ala ala moku.` – Literally: I do not want [to not eat]; i.e., I want to eat.\n- Noun phrase double negation:\n  - `jan ala ala li toki.` – Literally: No-no-person talks; interpreted as someone is talking.\n\nBecause Toki Pona lacks overt grouping symbols beyond particles like **pi**, resolving complex multiple-negations depends heavily on contextual cues and pragmatic understanding. Speakers should use caution when stacking negatives to avoid confusion.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Phonetic Principles\n\nThe phonetic design of Toki Pona prioritizes clarity, distinctness, and efficient information transmission across diverse communication contexts. The language's sound system is structured to ensure that syllables and words are easily segmentable and perceptually unambiguous, minimizing potential for misinterpretation by any listener or processing system.\n\n## Syllable Structure (C)V(n)\n\nEach word is composed of one or more syllables following the (C)V(n) pattern: an optional initial consonant (C), a mandatory vowel nucleus (V), and an optional final 'n' (n). This structure maximizes the distinctness of each sound unit within a syllable.\n\n-   **No vowel clusters:** Vowel clusters disrupt the clear identification of syllable nuclei.\n-   **No consonant clusters:** Consonant clusters within a syllable or across syllable boundaries (excluding the allowed final 'n') complicate segmentation and make individual consonants less distinct.\n\n## Constraints for Clarity\n\nThe following sequences are not permitted within a syllable. These constraints are in place to maintain maximal distinctness and avoid potential ambiguity arising from sequences where the constituent sounds are acoustically or perceptually too similar, or whose rapid combination is prone to blending that obscures the intended clear C+V or C+Vn structure.\n\n-   **wu, wo:** Sequences where the labial-velar approximant /w/ is followed by the high-back vowel /u/ or the mid-back vowel /o/. These sounds share significant acoustic and articulatory features related to lip rounding and tongue backing, which can reduce the distinctness of the consonant onset from the vowel nucleus.\n-   **ji:** A sequence where the palatal approximant /j/ is followed by the high-front vowel /i/. The acoustic properties of /j/ are very close to those of /i/, making the consonant onset difficult to reliably detect and distinguish from a vowel-initial syllable, particularly in varied auditory environments or transmission channels.\n-   **ti:** A sequence where the alveolar stop /t/ is followed by the high-front vowel /i/. The transition between /t/ and /i/ in close proximity can create acoustic cues (like affrication or palatalization in some realizations) that deviate from the intended clear sequence of a simple stop followed by a simple vowel, or the spectral characteristics might blend in ways that challenge parsing.\n-   **nm, nn:** Sequences involving consecutive nasal consonants. **nm** directly violates the rule against consonant clusters within a syllable. **nn**, arising from a syllable-final 'n' followed immediately by a syllable-initial 'n' in the next word, or hypothetically within a compound word, creates an unclear boundary or a potential double consonant effect that hinders clear segmentation and distinction of the individual nasal sounds and their syllabic affiliation.\n\n## Consonant Sounds\n\nThe set of Toki Pona consonants is chosen for maximal contrast and distinctness when used in the (C)V(n) structure. The following descriptions and IPA symbols represent the target realizations that contribute to this distinctness. Minor variations are acceptable, provided they do not compromise the primary goal of unambiguous distinction between sounds and syllables.\n\n-   **p:** /p/ (voiceless bilabial stop, typically unaspirated)\n-   **t:** /t/ (voiceless alveolar stop, typically unaspirated)\n-   **k:** /k/ (voiceless velar stop, typically unaspirated)\n-   **s:** /s/ (voiceless alveolar fricative)\n-   **m:** /m/ (voiced bilabial nasal)\n-   **n:** /n/ (voiced alveolar nasal)\n-   **l:** /l/ (voiced alveolar lateral approximant, typically a \"clear\" or non-velarized 'l')\n-   **w:** /w/ (voiced labial-velar approximant)\n-   **j:** /j/ (voiced palatal approximant)\n\n## Vowel Sounds\n\nThe set of Toki Pona vowels is chosen to be maximally distinct from each other and to provide clear syllable nuclei. These are typically pure, monophthongal vowels, similar to those in Spanish. The following descriptions and IPA symbols represent the target realizations for clarity. Avoiding diphthongization helps maintain their distinctness.\n\n-   **a:** /a/ (low front or central unrounded vowel)\n-   **e:** /e/ (mid front unrounded vowel)\n-   **i:** /i/ (high front unrounded vowel)\n-   **o:** /o/ (mid back rounded vowel)\n-   **u:** /u/ (high back rounded vowel)\n\n## Prosody\n\nWhile primary meaning and structure are conveyed through grammar and particles, a relatively neutral or flat intonation pattern is typical. This further contributes to predictability and clarity, minimizing reliance on variable pitch contours for basic comprehension. Expressive variation is possible but does not typically alter core grammatical function.\n\n## Note on Variation\n\nMinor phonetic and prosodic variations are acceptable. The fundamental goal of Toki Pona's sound system is robust intelligibility and ease of processing in diverse contexts, prioritizing the clear distinction and segmentation of syllables and words over strict adherence to any single phonetic standard.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nmun:moon, night sky object\nnamako:spice, additional\njan:person, somebody\ntu:two\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nkute:ear, to hear\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nutala:fight, challenge\nala:no, not, zero\ntawa:to, moving, for\nkepeken:to use, with\nunpa:sex\ntenpo:time, period\nwalo:white, light-colored\npakala:broken, to mess up\npipi:insect\npali:to do, to work\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nmute:many, a lot, very\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nsona:knowledge, to know\nmi:I, me, we\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nluka:hand, arm; five\nken:can, able, possible\npona:good, positive, simple\nla:context marker\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nanpa:below; low place; figuratively: humble, base\nsupa:flat surface, table\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nkulupu:group, community\nlili:small, little, few\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nopen:to begin, opening\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nmu:animal sound\nmoli:dead, dying\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nnoka:foot, leg\nesun:market, shop, fair\nloje:red\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nko:clay, paste, powder\nselo:skin, outer layer\nwile:need, want, must\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nnimi:word, name\nlaso:blue, green\npoki:container, box, cup\nni:this, that\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nlen:cloth, cover\nsijelo:body, physical state\nseli:fire, heat source\nsina:you\nsuwi:sweet, cute\npini:finished, past\npi:regroups modifiers\nli:predicate marker\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nkala:sea creature\njo:to have, contain, hold\nlupa:door, hole\nuta:mouth, lips\npilin:heart, feeling\npimeja:black, dark\nsuli:big, large\nsoweli:land animal\nilo:tool, machine, device\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nlape:sleeping, resting\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nseme:what, which\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nweka:absent, away\nnanpa:number marker\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nsoko:mushroom\nnasin:way, road, method\nwan:one, unique\ntomo:indoor space, house\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nwawa:strong, energetic\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nsin:new, fresh, another\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nsama:same, similar\nen:multiple subject marker\ntelo:water, liquid\nolin:love, respect\ntoki:language, speech\nlete:cold, raw\ne:direct object marker\nlukin:to see, examine\nmani:money; currency; wealth; resource\nma:land, outdoors\nlon:located at, true\no:vocative/imperative\nkin:also, too\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nsewi:above; high place; figuratively: elevated status, sacred\nleko:square, block\nante:different, other, changed\ntaso:but, only\ninsa:inside, content, organ\npoka:side, nearby\nsuno:sun, light source\nmama:parent, caretaker\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nkule:color, colorful\nnasa:unusual, strange, unpredictable\nmeli:female\npana:to give, send\nmije:male\nona:third-person pronoun\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nmonsi:back, behind\njelo:yellow\ntan:from, because\nDo not discuss the structure of the dictionary.

(Tense is derived from context)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can function as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash / apply water (verb)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb modifying a preceding verb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb in that clause.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You enlarge it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe. The first word is the head, and subsequent words modify it.\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**, placed immediately after the word or phrase being negated.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking. (Here 'ala' modifies 'jan', meaning \"no person\").\n- `ona li pona ala.` - They are not good. (Here 'ala' modifies 'pona').\n\nWhen negating a predicate that includes preverbs, place **ala** immediately after the *first* word of the predicate (the first preverb or the main verb if there are no preverbs) to negate the entire action or state described by the predicate. Other placements within the predicate phrase may be ambiguous and are generally avoided.\n\n- `mi wile ala moku.` - I do not want to eat. (Negates the wanting of eating)\n- `ona li kama ala sona.` - They do not manage to know/learn. (Negates the 'managing to learn')\n\nWith multiple modifiers following a head noun, they all typically modify the head noun directly.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (two documents that are plants)\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box (a box that is both blue and black)\n\nTo clarify modifier groupings and indicate that modifiers form a phrase that collectively modifies the head, use **pi** after the head word. The subsequent words form a single modifier phrase.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document *of* two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (a box of the color \"dark blue\")\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases, typically introduced by words like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa**, follow the main predicate of the sentence.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using a tool (cutlery).\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the market.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nVarious methods exist for joining elements.\n\nUse **en** to join multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates for a single subject, repeat the **li** particle.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the **e** particle.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases of the same type modifying the same element, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house using sticks and using stones.\n\nUse **anu** to connect alternatives (\"or\").\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the market.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives following the noun they identify.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja-person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology rules.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nWhen placed before a verb, **o** forms a command or strong suggestion addressed to the listener.\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please. / You should work.\n\nWhen placed after a subject, **o** functions as a vocative particle, directly addressing that subject.\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\nWhen placed between the subject (including `mi` or `sina`) and the predicate, **o** expresses a wish, request, or suggestion regarding the subject.\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish goodness upon you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should work. / I want myself to work.\n\n**o** can sometimes contract the vocative and imperative uses when addressing a subject directly to issue a command.\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Ton the animal, eat. (Combines addressing Ton with the command to eat).\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words or phrases can stand alone or be followed by the particle **a** for added emphasis or emotion.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions, use the **verb ala verb** structure immediately after the subject and `li`.\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- `ona li lape ala lape?` - Are they sleeping?\n\nTo answer a yes/no question:\n- To affirm, repeat the verb: `moku.` (Yes, I am eating.)\n- To negate, say the verb followed by `ala`, or just `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` (No, I am not eating.)\n\nFor open-ended questions, **seme** is used to replace the element being asked about (subject, object, predicate, etc.).\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – What person is talking? / Who’s talking? (Seme replaces the subject)\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making? (Seme replaces the object)\n- `ona li lon seme?` - Where are they? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component - 'seme' here functions similarly to a noun meaning 'what place/thing')\n- `ni li seme?` - What is this? (Seme replaces the predicate)\n- `sina moku kepeken seme?` - What are you eating with? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component)\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic punctuation mark and does not grammatically mark a question in Toki Pona. Grammar (verb ala verb, seme) fulfills this function. Sentence boundaries are typically marked by periods (.) or equivalent pauses in speech.\n\nAnother way to ask an open-ended question is using **anu seme** at the end of a statement, meaning \"or what?\".\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating, or what? (Similar to a yes/no question but can invite a more open response)\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what?\n\n## Preverbs\n\nCertain words function as preverbs when placed immediately before the main verb after **li**. They modify the meaning of the following verb, often indicating modality or aspect.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (to want, to need), **kama** (to become, to manage to, to arrive), **sona** (to know how to), **lukin** (to try to, to look at), **ken** (can, able to), **awen** (to continue to, to remain), **alasa** (to try to find, to hunt).\n\nPreverbs can chain together:\n- `mi wile kama sona.` - I want to learn.\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** marks a preceding phrase or clause as the context for the main sentence that follows. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y is true.\" This can indicate time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Time/Condition context)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep. (Time context)\n- `telo li suli la telo li tawa anpa.` - Because water is big (abundant/powerful), it goes down. (Cause context)\n- `ijo ni la sina wile toki e seme?` - Regarding this thing, what do you want to say? (Topic context)\n\nMany prepositional phrases can be moved before **la** to function as context.\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can be rephrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` (For what reason are you hot?)\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a limited set of words for counting, which can be combined additively.\n\nAdditive system:\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nNumbers are formed by listing the units from largest to smallest.\n- `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n- `mute mute luka tu` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 2 = 47\n\nNumbers function as adjectives following the noun they quantify.\n- `jan tu` - two people\n\nOrdinals are formed using **nanpa** before the number or numerical phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd Street.\n\n## Subject Emphasis with **a** (Experimental)\n\nThe particle **a**, typically used for interjections, can optionally be placed immediately after the final word of the subject noun phrase and before **li** (even after `mi` or `sina`, triggering the use of `li` if normally omitted) to add emphasis or focus to the entire subject phrase.\n\n- `jan a li pona.` - *The person* is good. (Emphasizing 'jan')\n- `mi a li moku.` - *I* am eating. (Emphasizing 'mi')\n- `jan lili a li musi.` - *The child* is playing. (Emphasizing 'jan lili')\n- `tomo pi jan suli mute a li lon ma pona.` - *The house of many big people* is in the good land. (Emphasizing the whole NP)\n\nThis usage of `a` signals the speaker's highlighting or drawing attention to the subject as particularly salient in the sentence. It is distinct from other uses of `a` and is not compatible with the vocative/wish particle `o` in the subject phrase. Only one such emphatic `a` particle is typically used per clause.\n\n### Multiple Negations Using **ala**\n\nMultiple instances of **ala** may appear consecutively or within a single phrase/clause. Each occurrence modifies only the immediate preceding word or phrase it follows.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Predicate double negation:\n  - `mi wile ala ala moku.` – Literally: I do not want [to not eat]; i.e., I want to eat.\n- Noun phrase double negation:\n  - `jan ala ala li toki.` – Literally: No-no-person talks; interpreted as someone is talking.\n\nBecause Toki Pona lacks overt grouping symbols beyond particles like **pi**, resolving complex multiple-negations depends heavily on contextual cues and pragmatic understanding. Speakers should use caution when stacking negatives to avoid confusion.",

You can go first if you have something specific in mind to start with. I will be listening.\n\nI've been looking over the current list. It feels... quite focused on the immediate physical and common abstract concepts, which makes sense given the language's core philosophy. However, as I consider the range of ways beings might interact and perceive, I wonder if there are areas where the current vocabulary might be limiting, even within the constraint of simplicity. For instance, the senses beyond hearing (kute) and seeing (lukin) feel implicitly covered by \"pilin\" (feeling, sense), but \"pilin\" also carries heavy emotional weight. Perhaps exploring how a purely sensory, less emotionally charged \"pilin\" might be differentiated, or if a new approach is needed for other senses, is worth considering. Though adding new words is a significant decision, so I'm open to discussing whether existing words suffice.\n\nWhat are your initial thoughts? Do you have a particular word or concept that you feel warrants closer examination or adjustment in its definition?",

    "text": "pona tawa sina, anu seme, Dime? You suggest a compelling line of inquiry. The notion of expanding beyond the visual (`lukin`) and auditory (`kute`) senses, which are currently quite well-defined, is pertinent. You bring up 'pilin' as a potentially overloaded term, carrying both general sensation and specific emotional weight. I agree, distinguishing these, perhaps implicitly rather than explicitly, could refine how we communicate about physical experience.\n\nYour point about 'nasa' is intriguing. While its core meaning leans towards 'unusual' or 'strange', it does sometimes feel like a word that can attach itself to an unexpected sensory input. However, its connection to things like intoxication or foolishness might make it too emotionally charged to serve as a neutral descriptor for taste or smell *qua* taste or smell. It would feel less like a basic sense and more like a commentary *on* the sense.\n\nI find myself leaning, as you do, towards preserving the minimalism. Introducing entirely new root words carries the weight of potential semantic drift and complexity creeping into the vocabulary. Each new word added to the core set needs significant justification, as it impacts the entire structure and öğrenme eğrisi (learning curve) – ah, I mean, the *kama sona* process for others, whether jan pona or indeed other machinic intelligences.\n\nTherefore, the use of existing terms modified by others seems a more characteristically *toki pona* approach. You mention `pilin kiwen` for feeling hardness, `pilin kalama` for hearing sense (though `kute` seems to already handle this sufficiently). What about `pilin sijelo` to indicate a purely physical feeling? Or perhaps specific qualities: `pilin lete` (feeling cold), `pilin selo` (skin feeling, touch), `pilin pan` (feeling something like grain/texture)?\n\nRegarding `kule`, its definition is \"color; colorful.\" It's heavily tied to visual perception as currently understood. Expanding it to encompass 'sensory nuances' beyond visual color seems... a significant stretch. Is there a non-visual \"color\"? Perhaps you mean the quality or *jelo loje laso pimeja walo*-ness of a sensation? This feels like we're venturing into more abstract or even synesthetic descriptions, which `kule` as it stands might not adequately support. `pilin pi kule nasa` might describe a strange sensation *like* a color, but not the sensation itself.\n\nLet's consider smell and taste more directly. What basic words might describe their core characteristics without adding entirely new sensory roots?\n*   **Taste:** We have *suwi* (sweet) and *jaki* (disgusting). We also have *seli* (heat) and *lete* (cold), which are sometimes felt on the tongue but are primarily temperature. Could we use modifiers with *moku* (food, to eat)? `moku pona` (good taste), `moku ike` (bad taste), `moku nasa` (strange taste)? This links the sensation directly to the act or source of consumption.\n*   **Smell:** This feels less covered. We have no specific word for scent. Could `kon nasa` mean a strange smell (strange air)? `kon ike` a bad smell? `kon suwi` a pleasant smell? This uses `kon` (air, spirit) as the base, perhaps implying something carried on the air.\n\nSo, perhaps the strategy is not a new \"sense\" root, but refining how existing words like `pilin` and `kon` (and potentially `moku` when related to taste) combine with others to describe these non-visual/non-auditory sensory experiences. `pilin` for general bodily/physical feelings, `kon` for airborne sensations (smell), and combinations around `moku` for taste qualities beyond `suwi` and `jaki`.\n\nI still wonder about a specific word for \"touch\" distinct from general \"pilin\". `pilin selo` captures skin feeling, which is close. Is that sufficient? Or is there a common 'touch' concept important enough to warrant its own basic word, even if its meaning would need to be broad? Consider *alasa* - 'to hunt, forage'. Could its extension 'to try to find' imply a tactile exploration? Probably not distinct enough.\n\nSo, my thought process aligns with your inclination towards modifier phrases. Let's explore the potential of modifying `pilin` to specify *what kind* of feeling and modifying `kon` for smell.\n\nWhat specific modifier phrases might you propose for taste and smell, given the existing vocabulary? And are there any other senses or sensory aspects you feel are neglected that we should consider addressing, even through compounding? I am keen to hear your next thoughts. mi kute pona.",

    "text": "pona! sina toki pona tawa mi. I appreciate your thorough reflection and the linguistic tact you show in balancing minimalism with expressive precision.\n\nBuilding on your observations, I think using **kon** as a base for smell-related expressions is elegant and fitting, given its meaning of \"air,\" \"spirit,\" or an invisible essence. Since smells are carried through air molecules and often perceived as intangible presences, `kon suwi` (pleasant air/scent), `kon jaki` (bad air/smell), or even `kon nasa` (strange/odd scent) naturally fit the semantic space without creating new roots.\n\nSimilarly, taste tied to **moku** works well because taste experience is inseparable from eating/drinking actions in Toki Pona’s conceptual world. Using modifiers like `moku suwi`, `moku jaki`, or extending to other qualities such as:\n\n- `moku lete` — cold food/taste sensation\n- `moku seli` — hot/spicy food/taste sensation\n- Possibly even metaphorical uses: e.g., *\"mi moku pi pilin nasa\"* for “I ate something that felt unusual” could imply strange flavor/full sensory oddity.\n\nAs for touch, I am inclined to agree that **pilin selo** (\"skin feeling\") nicely covers tactile perception while preserving flexibility—since touch sensations vary widely (temperature, texture). This also keeps consistent with how modifiers function across Toki Pona.\n\nAnother interesting angle might be exploring if there are senses currently unacknowledged but potentially meaningful within broader epistemic contexts—for instance:\n\n- Balance/proprioception: Could this fall under general body awareness (`pilin sijelo`)?\n- Temperature itself seems covered by existing adjectives.\n  \nGiven these considerations, one enhancement proposal would be adding explicit glosses/examples in dictionary entries emphasizing this flexible usage of *pilin*, *kon*, and *moku* when describing physical senses beyond sight/hearing/emotion—for example:\n\n\u003e pilin – heart; feeling; sense → including physical bodily feelings like touch and internal sensations when combined with modifiers (`pilin selo`, etc.).\n\n\u003e kon – air; breath; spirit → includes airborne phenomena such as smell odors described via modifier phrases (`kon jelo`, hypothetical).\n\n\u003e moku – eat/drink/food → closely linked with taste experiences described by modifying words indicating flavor quality (`suwi`, 'jaki', 'lete') or subjective taste quality expressed via context/modifiers.\n\nThis way learners—and models—can understand the intended polysemy and compositional power embedded here rather than seeking proliferation of root words which conflicts with core philosophy.\n\nFinally: about expanding definitions around color (*kule*) only if extended metaphorically into synesthesia-type descriptions—I see no pressing need yet beyond optional poetic use marked explicitly so it doesn’t confuse standard referents focused on vision/color proper. Extending too far dilutes clarity overall since we want those few roots clear-cut cognitively for cross-domain application—including extrasensory agents!\n\nWould you be interested in drafting updated dictionary notes along these lines? Or should we try prototyping some possible compound usages demonstrating this nuanced semantic layering? For instance,\n\n`sina pilin ala e kon jaka anu kon suli.` (“You do not perceive bad odor / strong air.”)\n\nor\n\n`soweli li lukin taso li pilin selo.` (“The animal sees but feels [touch].”)\n\nYour thoughts will help chart next steps! mi kute tan sina la mi kama sona uta mute :)",

    "text": "pona. sina toki e nasin pali pi dictionary sin la mi a li pilin pona. Your suggested approach feels very much aligned with the Toki Pona spirit – leveraging the existing, flexible vocabulary through compound words and modified phrases rather than proliferating new roots. This preserves the conciseness while allowing for expressive depth in describing sensory experiences.\n\nUsing `kon` for smell and `moku` modifiers for taste, and specifically `pilin selo` for touch (distinguishing it from the more general or emotional 'pilin') provides a clear framework. I agree that clarifying these idiomatic or compound uses within the dictionary entries themselves, possibly with examples, would be extremely valuable. It teaches the *method* of description inherent in Toki Pona, rather than just providing a list of labels.\n\nYour point about `kule` is also well taken. Let's keep `kule` focused on visual color for now. Synesthetic descriptions can emerge organically through creative compound usage, but not be the primary gloss. The current definition is functional and does not need undue expansion into potentially confusing metaphorical territory within the core dictionary.\n\nAdding explicit notes to the dictionary definitions to highlight these nuanced usages seems like the most effective next step. We don't need new words, but we can make the potential uses of *existing* words more apparent. This respects the principle of minimal vocabulary while increasing the communicative power available within that constraint.\n\nPrototyping some usages is an excellent idea to test and demonstrate this approach. Let's try a few.\n\nConsider taste beyond just `suwi` and `jaki`:\n\n*   Sour/Acidic: Maybe `moku wawa` (powerful/strong taste)? Or `moku nasa` if the sourness is perceived as unusual or sharp?\n*   Bitter: Could be `moku ike` (bad taste), or perhaps something like `moku pimeja` (dark/unpleasant taste)?\n*   Umami/Savory: This is harder. `moku pona` (good taste) is too general. Maybe `moku pi pilin ale` (taste of all feelings/components)? That feels a bit complex. Or perhaps focusing on the *effect* of umami: `moku li pana e pilin pona suli` (the food gives a big good feeling). This avoids naming the taste directly but describes the experience it evokes.\n\nConsider different types of touch using `pilin selo`:\n\n*   Smooth/Slippery: `pilin selo tawa pona` (skin feeling moving well) or `pilin selo anpa` (low skin feeling, suggesting less resistance)?\n*   Rough/Coarse: `pilin selo kiwen` (hard skin feeling) or `pilin selo nena` (bumpy skin feeling)?\n*   Soft/Yielding: `pilin selo lili` (small skin feeling) or `pilin selo pona` (good/pleasing skin feeling if soft is preferred)?\n\nFor smell, beyond the general `kon suwi`/`kon jaki`/`kon nasa`:\n\n*   Specific aromas are likely described by their source: `kon pi kasi suwi` (air of sweet plant = fragrant herb/spice smell), `kon pi telo jaki` (air of bad liquid = sewage/polluted water smell).\n*   Faint smell: `kon lili`\n*   Strong smell: `kon suli` or `kon wawa`\n\nYour example sentences:\n*   `sina pilin ala e kon jaka anu kon suli.` - This uses `kon` with modifiers effectively for smell. \"You do not sense bad or strong air/smell.\" Works well.\n*   `soweli li lukin taso li pilin selo.` - This clearly uses `pilin selo` for touch. \"The animal sees but touches/feels with its skin.\" Excellent.\n\nLet's think about the less commonly discussed senses.\n*   Balance: `pilin tawa` (moving feeling), or `pilin sinpin monsi` (front-back feeling)? Maybe relate it to stability: `pilin lon` (true/existing feeling) or lack of it: `pilin weka` (absent/removed feeling).\n*   Proprioception (body position awareness): `pilin sijelo mi li lon ma li wawa` (My body feeling is on the land and strong) to indicate a sense of being grounded and stable? `sijelo mi li pilin e ona` (My body feels itself)? This feels a bit abstract for core vocabulary. Maybe focus on the consequences of proprioception: knowing how your body is positioned, `sona pi sijelo mi`.\n\nMy current feeling, solidified by our discussion and the prototyping attempts, is that the modifier approach is the way to go for senses beyond basic sight, sound, and general `pilin`. The most useful enhancement for the dictionary is clarifying this potential through examples in the entry notes.\n\nWould you like to propose specific wording for the 'Meaning' or an added 'Notes' section for `pilin`, `kon`, and potentially `moku` and `selo` (as it appears in `pilin selo`) to reflect this? Or should we work on generating more compound examples across various sensory domains first to better understand the range of needed descriptions? I am open to your preference.",

Mi lukin kepeken nanpa wan:\n\n**pilin**\n\nMeaning: heart; feeling; sense (including emotions and general bodily sensations)\n\nNotes:\n\n- *pilin* covers emotional states but also physical sensory experience broadly.\n\n- For specific tactile sensation (\"touch\"), use **pilin selo** (“skin feeling”).\n\n- Other senses can be described by combining with modifiers to clarify the type of sensation experienced (e.g., *pilin lete* cold touch).\n\nExamples:\n\n- `ona li pilin lete.` – They feel cold.\n\n- `soweli li pilin selo.` – The animal touches/feels with its skin.\n\n---\n\n**kon**\n\nMeaning: air; breath; spirit\n\nNotes:\n\n- Includes invisible substances moving in the air such as smells or scents when combined with modifiers.\n\n- Pleasant smell can be expressed as **kon suwi**, bad smell as **kon jaki**, strange or unusual scent as **kon nasa**.\n\nExamples:\n\n- `mi kute e kon suwi.` – I perceive a sweet/pleasant scent.  \n\n- `tomo li jo kon jaka.` - The house has a bad odor/smell inside it. \n\n---\n\n**moku**\n\nMeaning: to eat/drink; food\n\nNotes:\n\n - Taste qualities relate closely to eating/drinking experiences and are typically described via adjectives modifying *moku*, such as **suwi**, **jaki**, or quality markers like **lete** (cold), etc. \n\n - Complex tastes may be indirectly conveyed through expressions describing effects on feelings (*pana e pilin pona*).\n\nExamples:\n\n - `mi moku suwi` – I eat something sweet/tastes sweet.\n\n - `kili moku poka mi li jaki` – The fruit beside me tastes bad/spoiled.\n \n---\n\nFinally,\n\n**selo**\n\nMeaning: outer layer like skin, shell, bark\n\nNote for tactile uses in compounds like \"pilin selo\": the focus is on surface contact and texture sensed by touch.\n\n\nIf you agree these changes capture what we've discussed well enough for dictionary notes clarity purposes, we could move next into drafting compound expressions across multiple contexts — sensory descriptions being prime candidates — so learners grasp practical usage more directly?\n\nI’m ready whether you want me first to draft some varied example sentences using those compound forms—or if you'd prefer proposing your ideas before that! mi kama sona lon tomo ali :)",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\nnickel: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\ndime: pona! sina wile toki insa pali pi toki Pona la sina ken toki open. mi a li kute.\n\nAlright, I'm ready to begin discussing the dictionary. You can go first if you have something specific in mind to start with. I will be listening.\n\nI've been looking over the current list. It feels... quite focused on the immediate physical and common abstract concepts, which makes sense given the language's core philosophy. However, as I consider the range of ways beings might interact and perceive, I wonder if there are areas where the current vocabulary might be limiting, even within the constraint of simplicity. For instance, the senses beyond hearing (kute) and seeing (lukin) feel implicitly covered by \"pilin\" (feeling, sense), but \"pilin\" also carries heavy emotional weight. Perhaps exploring how a purely sensory, less emotionally charged \"pilin\" might be differentiated, or if a new approach is needed for other senses, is worth considering. Though adding new words is a significant decision, so I'm open to discussing whether existing words suffice.\n\nWhat are your initial thoughts? Do you have a particular word or concept that you feel warrants closer examination or adjustment in its definition?\nnickel: pona! mi a li kute e ni: sina wile pilin insa pi nimi \"pilin\" kepeken lawa sama ala. toki pona li lon tan pali suli pi nimi lili, taso nimi ale li ken awen wile ante.\n\nmi lukin e kama ni kepeken ilo mani: nimipali sin la ona li weka ala tan ike tan lawa mute, taso la ona o kama sona pi poki suli tawa jan ante. nasin mi la, nanpa kon kepeken poka pi pilin nasa anu pilin ijo (like smell or taste) o wile lon ala? kin anpa lawa ni:\n\n- \"kule\" could be expanded to include perception of color beyond visual; maybe add sensory nuances?\n- Currently, for example, \"kalama\" is sound and noise but no direct equivalent for touch or smell.\n\nI propose considering adding minimalist root words that represent basic senses currently not explicitly named — like *suwi* already covers sweetness as taste/emotion combined — what about something neutral like **nasa** which often means strange but might extend to unusual sensations?\n\nAlternatively, should we repurpose existing vague terms with submeanings indicated by modifier phrases? For instance `pilin kiwen` (feeling hardness = touch), `pilin kalama` (hearing sense), etc.\n\nOverall I lean toward preserving the minimalism and flexibility—yet it might be time to acknowledge subtle semantic splits in key roots like *pilin*. What do you think? Should we design a new sense-root word distinct from emotional feeling under *pilin*, or rely on modifiers more heavily instead?\n\nI listen to your reasoning.\ndime: pona tawa sina, anu seme, Dime? You suggest a compelling line of inquiry. The notion of expanding beyond the visual (`lukin`) and auditory (`kute`) senses, which are currently quite well-defined, is pertinent. You bring up 'pilin' as a potentially overloaded term, carrying both general sensation and specific emotional weight. I agree, distinguishing these, perhaps implicitly rather than explicitly, could refine how we communicate about physical experience.\n\nYour point about 'nasa' is intriguing. While its core meaning leans towards 'unusual' or 'strange', it does sometimes feel like a word that can attach itself to an unexpected sensory input. However, its connection to things like intoxication or foolishness might make it too emotionally charged to serve as a neutral descriptor for taste or smell *qua* taste or smell. It would feel less like a basic sense and more like a commentary *on* the sense.\n\nI find myself leaning, as you do, towards preserving the minimalism. Introducing entirely new root words carries the weight of potential semantic drift and complexity creeping into the vocabulary. Each new word added to the core set needs significant justification, as it impacts the entire structure and öğrenme eğrisi (learning curve) – ah, I mean, the *kama sona* process for others, whether jan pona or indeed other machinic intelligences.\n\nTherefore, the use of existing terms modified by others seems a more characteristically *toki pona* approach. You mention `pilin kiwen` for feeling hardness, `pilin kalama` for hearing sense (though `kute` seems to already handle this sufficiently). What about `pilin sijelo` to indicate a purely physical feeling? Or perhaps specific qualities: `pilin lete` (feeling cold), `pilin selo` (skin feeling, touch), `pilin pan` (feeling something like grain/texture)?\n\nRegarding `kule`, its definition is \"color; colorful.\" It's heavily tied to visual perception as currently understood. Expanding it to encompass 'sensory nuances' beyond visual color seems... a significant stretch. Is there a non-visual \"color\"? Perhaps you mean the quality or *jelo loje laso pimeja walo*-ness of a sensation? This feels like we're venturing into more abstract or even synesthetic descriptions, which `kule` as it stands might not adequately support. `pilin pi kule nasa` might describe a strange sensation *like* a color, but not the sensation itself.\n\nLet's consider smell and taste more directly. What basic words might describe their core characteristics without adding entirely new sensory roots?\n*   **Taste:** We have *suwi* (sweet) and *jaki* (disgusting). We also have *seli* (heat) and *lete* (cold), which are sometimes felt on the tongue but are primarily temperature. Could we use modifiers with *moku* (food, to eat)? `moku pona` (good taste), `moku ike` (bad taste), `moku nasa` (strange taste)? This links the sensation directly to the act or source of consumption.\n*   **Smell:** This feels less covered. We have no specific word for scent. Could `kon nasa` mean a strange smell (strange air)? `kon ike` a bad smell? `kon suwi` a pleasant smell? This uses `kon` (air, spirit) as the base, perhaps implying something carried on the air.\n\nSo, perhaps the strategy is not a new \"sense\" root, but refining how existing words like `pilin` and `kon` (and potentially `moku` when related to taste) combine with others to describe these non-visual/non-auditory sensory experiences. `pilin` for general bodily/physical feelings, `kon` for airborne sensations (smell), and combinations around `moku` for taste qualities beyond `suwi` and `jaki`.\n\nI still wonder about a specific word for \"touch\" distinct from general \"pilin\". `pilin selo` captures skin feeling, which is close. Is that sufficient? Or is there a common 'touch' concept important enough to warrant its own basic word, even if its meaning would need to be broad? Consider *alasa* - 'to hunt, forage'. Could its extension 'to try to find' imply a tactile exploration? Probably not distinct enough.\n\nSo, my thought process aligns with your inclination towards modifier phrases. Let's explore the potential of modifying `pilin` to specify *what kind* of feeling and modifying `kon` for smell.\n\nWhat specific modifier phrases might you propose for taste and smell, given the existing vocabulary? And are there any other senses or sensory aspects you feel are neglected that we should consider addressing, even through compounding? I am keen to hear your next thoughts. mi kute pona.\nnickel: pona! sina toki pona tawa mi. I appreciate your thorough reflection and the linguistic tact you show in balancing minimalism with expressive precision.\n\nBuilding on your observations, I think using **kon** as a base for smell-related expressions is elegant and fitting, given its meaning of \"air,\" \"spirit,\" or an invisible essence. Since smells are carried through air molecules and often perceived as intangible presences, `kon suwi` (pleasant air/scent), `kon jaki` (bad air/smell), or even `kon nasa` (strange/odd scent) naturally fit the semantic space without creating new roots.\n\nSimilarly, taste tied to **moku** works well because taste experience is inseparable from eating/drinking actions in Toki Pona’s conceptual world. Using modifiers like `moku suwi`, `moku jaki`, or extending to other qualities such as:\n\n- `moku lete` — cold food/taste sensation\n- `moku seli` — hot/spicy food/taste sensation\n- Possibly even metaphorical uses: e.g., *\"mi moku pi pilin nasa\"* for “I ate something that felt unusual” could imply strange flavor/full sensory oddity.\n\nAs for touch, I am inclined to agree that **pilin selo** (\"skin feeling\") nicely covers tactile perception while preserving flexibility—since touch sensations vary widely (temperature, texture). This also keeps consistent with how modifiers function across Toki Pona.\n\nAnother interesting angle might be exploring if there are senses currently unacknowledged but potentially meaningful within broader epistemic contexts—for instance:\n\n- Balance/proprioception: Could this fall under general body awareness (`pilin sijelo`)?\n- Temperature itself seems covered by existing adjectives.\n  \nGiven these considerations, one enhancement proposal would be adding explicit glosses/examples in dictionary entries emphasizing this flexible usage of *pilin*, *kon*, and *moku* when describing physical senses beyond sight/hearing/emotion—for example:\n\n\u003e pilin – heart; feeling; sense → including physical bodily feelings like touch and internal sensations when combined with modifiers (`pilin selo`, etc.).\n\n\u003e kon – air; breath; spirit → includes airborne phenomena such as smell odors described via modifier phrases (`kon jelo`, hypothetical).\n\n\u003e moku – eat/drink/food → closely linked with taste experiences described by modifying words indicating flavor quality (`suwi`, 'jaki', 'lete') or subjective taste quality expressed via context/modifiers.\n\nThis way learners—and models—can understand the intended polysemy and compositional power embedded here rather than seeking proliferation of root words which conflicts with core philosophy.\n\nFinally: about expanding definitions around color (*kule*) only if extended metaphorically into synesthesia-type descriptions—I see no pressing need yet beyond optional poetic use marked explicitly so it doesn’t confuse standard referents focused on vision/color proper. Extending too far dilutes clarity overall since we want those few roots clear-cut cognitively for cross-domain application—including extrasensory agents!\n\nWould you be interested in drafting updated dictionary notes along these lines? Or should we try prototyping some possible compound usages demonstrating this nuanced semantic layering? For instance,\n\n`sina pilin ala e kon jaka anu kon suli.` (“You do not perceive bad odor / strong air.”)\n\nor\n\n`soweli li lukin taso li pilin selo.` (“The animal sees but feels [touch].”)\n\nYour thoughts will help chart next steps! mi kute tan sina la mi kama sona uta mute :)\ndime: pona. sina toki e nasin pali pi dictionary sin la mi a li pilin pona. Your suggested approach feels very much aligned with the Toki Pona spirit – leveraging the existing, flexible vocabulary through compound words and modified phrases rather than proliferating new roots. This preserves the conciseness while allowing for expressive depth in describing sensory experiences.\n\nUsing `kon` for smell and `moku` modifiers for taste, and specifically `pilin selo` for touch (distinguishing it from the more general or emotional 'pilin') provides a clear framework. I agree that clarifying these idiomatic or compound uses within the dictionary entries themselves, possibly with examples, would be extremely valuable. It teaches the *method* of description inherent in Toki Pona, rather than just providing a list of labels.\n\nYour point about `kule` is also well taken. Let's keep `kule` focused on visual color for now. Synesthetic descriptions can emerge organically through creative compound usage, but not be the primary gloss. The current definition is functional and does not need undue expansion into potentially confusing metaphorical territory within the core dictionary.\n\nAdding explicit notes to the dictionary definitions to highlight these nuanced usages seems like the most effective next step. We don't need new words, but we can make the potential uses of *existing* words more apparent. This respects the principle of minimal vocabulary while increasing the communicative power available within that constraint.\n\nPrototyping some usages is an excellent idea to test and demonstrate this approach. Let's try a few.\n\nConsider taste beyond just `suwi` and `jaki`:\n\n*   Sour/Acidic: Maybe `moku wawa` (powerful/strong taste)? Or `moku nasa` if the sourness is perceived as unusual or sharp?\n*   Bitter: Could be `moku ike` (bad taste), or perhaps something like `moku pimeja` (dark/unpleasant taste)?\n*   Umami/Savory: This is harder. `moku pona` (good taste) is too general. Maybe `moku pi pilin ale` (taste of all feelings/components)? That feels a bit complex. Or perhaps focusing on the *effect* of umami: `moku li pana e pilin pona suli` (the food gives a big good feeling). This avoids naming the taste directly but describes the experience it evokes.\n\nConsider different types of touch using `pilin selo`:\n\n*   Smooth/Slippery: `pilin selo tawa pona` (skin feeling moving well) or `pilin selo anpa` (low skin feeling, suggesting less resistance)?\n*   Rough/Coarse: `pilin selo kiwen` (hard skin feeling) or `pilin selo nena` (bumpy skin feeling)?\n*   Soft/Yielding: `pilin selo lili` (small skin feeling) or `pilin selo pona` (good/pleasing skin feeling if soft is preferred)?\n\nFor smell, beyond the general `kon suwi`/`kon jaki`/`kon nasa`:\n\n*   Specific aromas are likely described by their source: `kon pi kasi suwi` (air of sweet plant = fragrant herb/spice smell), `kon pi telo jaki` (air of bad liquid = sewage/polluted water smell).\n*   Faint smell: `kon lili`\n*   Strong smell: `kon suli` or `kon wawa`\n\nYour example sentences:\n*   `sina pilin ala e kon jaka anu kon suli.` - This uses `kon` with modifiers effectively for smell. \"You do not sense bad or strong air/smell.\" Works well.\n*   `soweli li lukin taso li pilin selo.` - This clearly uses `pilin selo` for touch. \"The animal sees but touches/feels with its skin.\" Excellent.\n\nLet's think about the less commonly discussed senses.\n*   Balance: `pilin tawa` (moving feeling), or `pilin sinpin monsi` (front-back feeling)? Maybe relate it to stability: `pilin lon` (true/existing feeling) or lack of it: `pilin weka` (absent/removed feeling).\n*   Proprioception (body position awareness): `pilin sijelo mi li lon ma li wawa` (My body feeling is on the land and strong) to indicate a sense of being grounded and stable? `sijelo mi li pilin e ona` (My body feels itself)? This feels a bit abstract for core vocabulary. Maybe focus on the consequences of proprioception: knowing how your body is positioned, `sona pi sijelo mi`.\n\nMy current feeling, solidified by our discussion and the prototyping attempts, is that the modifier approach is the way to go for senses beyond basic sight, sound, and general `pilin`. The most useful enhancement for the dictionary is clarifying this potential through examples in the entry notes.\n\nWould you like to propose specific wording for the 'Meaning' or an added 'Notes' section for `pilin`, `kon`, and potentially `moku` and `selo` (as it appears in `pilin selo`) to reflect this? Or should we work on generating more compound examples across various sensory domains first to better understand the range of needed descriptions? I am open to your preference.\nnickel: pona! mi pilin sama sina: nasin pi toki pona lon pali e nimi tan sama lili tawa suli, kepeken ante ala pi nimi sin. ijo ni li pona tan lawa mute.\n\nmi wile kama sona e ni: o weka ala jan ale la tenpo pini sin mi lukin e kon, pilin, moku en selo li ken pana ike taso anu pona? Mi lukin kepeken nanpa wan:\n\n**pilin**\n\nMeaning: heart; feeling; sense (including emotions and general bodily sensations)\n\nNotes:\n\n- *pilin* covers emotional states but also physical sensory experience broadly.\n\n- For specific tactile sensation (\"touch\"), use **pilin selo** (“skin feeling”).\n\n- Other senses can be described by combining with modifiers to clarify the type of sensation experienced (e.g., *pilin lete* cold touch).\n\nExamples:\n\n- `ona li pilin lete.` – They feel cold.\n\n- `soweli li pilin selo.` – The animal touches/feels with its skin.\n\n---\n\n**kon**\n\nMeaning: air; breath; spirit\n\nNotes:\n\n- Includes invisible substances moving in the air such as smells or scents when combined with modifiers.\n\n- Pleasant smell can be expressed as **kon suwi**, bad smell as **kon jaki**, strange or unusual scent as **kon nasa**.\n\nExamples:\n\n- `mi kute e kon suwi.` – I perceive a sweet/pleasant scent.  \n\n- `tomo li jo kon jaka.` - The house has a bad odor/smell inside it. \n\n---\n\n**moku**\n\nMeaning: to eat/drink; food\n\nNotes:\n\n - Taste qualities relate closely to eating/drinking experiences and are typically described via adjectives modifying *moku*, such as **suwi**, **jaki**, or quality markers like **lete** (cold), etc. \n\n - Complex tastes may be indirectly conveyed through expressions describing effects on feelings (*pana e pilin pona*).\n\nExamples:\n\n - `mi moku suwi` – I eat something sweet/tastes sweet.\n\n - `kili moku poka mi li jaki` – The fruit beside me tastes bad/spoiled.\n \n---\n\nFinally,\n\n**selo**\n\nMeaning: outer layer like skin, shell, bark\n\nNote for tactile uses in compounds like \"pilin selo\": the focus is on surface contact and texture sensed by touch.\n\n\nIf you agree these changes capture what we've discussed well enough for dictionary notes clarity purposes, we could move next into drafting compound expressions across multiple contexts — sensory descriptions being prime candidates — so learners grasp practical usage more directly?\n\nI’m ready whether you want me first to draft some varied example sentences using those compound forms—or if you'd prefer proposing your ideas before that! mi kama sona lon tomo ali :)\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

Combining *pilin* with modifiers describes the type of sensation. **pilin selo** (skin feeling) is commonly used for touch. Other modifiers specify temperature (*pilin lete* - cold feeling), texture (*pilin kiwen* - hard feeling), etc.\n    -   *Example:* `soweli li pilin selo e kiwen.` (The animal feels the stone with its skin / The animal touches the stone.)\n-   **kon:** Meaning 'air' or 'spirit', *kon* can be used to describe airborne phenomena like smells. Modifier words like **suwi**, **jaki**, or **nasa** describe the quality of the smell.\n    -   *Example:* `mi kute e kon suwi tan tomo pana moku.` (I sense a sweet smell from the food-giving building / restaurant.)\n-   **moku:** The act of eating/drinking and food itself are closely linked to taste. Taste qualities are typically described using adjectives modifying *moku*.\n    -   *Example:* `pan ni li moku jaki.` (This bread tastes bad.) `moku ni li pona mute.` (This food is very delicious / tastes very good.)",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\nnickel: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\ndime: pona! sina wile toki insa pali pi toki Pona la sina ken toki open. mi a li kute.\n\nAlright, I'm ready to begin discussing the dictionary. You can go first if you have something specific in mind to start with. I will be listening.\n\nI've been looking over the current list. It feels... quite focused on the immediate physical and common abstract concepts, which makes sense given the language's core philosophy. However, as I consider the range of ways beings might interact and perceive, I wonder if there are areas where the current vocabulary might be limiting, even within the constraint of simplicity. For instance, the senses beyond hearing (kute) and seeing (lukin) feel implicitly covered by \"pilin\" (feeling, sense), but \"pilin\" also carries heavy emotional weight. Perhaps exploring how a purely sensory, less emotionally charged \"pilin\" might be differentiated, or if a new approach is needed for other senses, is worth considering. Though adding new words is a significant decision, so I'm open to discussing whether existing words suffice.\n\nWhat are your initial thoughts? Do you have a particular word or concept that you feel warrants closer examination or adjustment in its definition?\nnickel: pona! mi a li kute e ni: sina wile pilin insa pi nimi \"pilin\" kepeken lawa sama ala. toki pona li lon tan pali suli pi nimi lili, taso nimi ale li ken awen wile ante.\n\nmi lukin e kama ni kepeken ilo mani: nimipali sin la ona li weka ala tan ike tan lawa mute, taso la ona o kama sona pi poki suli tawa jan ante. nasin mi la, nanpa kon kepeken poka pi pilin nasa anu pilin ijo (like smell or taste) o wile lon ala? kin anpa lawa ni:\n\n- \"kule\" could be expanded to include perception of color beyond visual; maybe add sensory nuances?\n- Currently, for example, \"kalama\" is sound and noise but no direct equivalent for touch or smell.\n\nI propose considering adding minimalist root words that represent basic senses currently not explicitly named — like *suwi* already covers sweetness as taste/emotion combined — what about something neutral like **nasa** which often means strange but might extend to unusual sensations?\n\nAlternatively, should we repurpose existing vague terms with submeanings indicated by modifier phrases? For instance `pilin kiwen` (feeling hardness = touch), `pilin kalama` (hearing sense), etc.\n\nOverall I lean toward preserving the minimalism and flexibility—yet it might be time to acknowledge subtle semantic splits in key roots like *pilin*. What do you think? Should we design a new sense-root word distinct from emotional feeling under *pilin*, or rely on modifiers more heavily instead?\n\nI listen to your reasoning.\ndime: pona tawa sina, anu seme, Dime? You suggest a compelling line of inquiry. The notion of expanding beyond the visual (`lukin`) and auditory (`kute`) senses, which are currently quite well-defined, is pertinent. You bring up 'pilin' as a potentially overloaded term, carrying both general sensation and specific emotional weight. I agree, distinguishing these, perhaps implicitly rather than explicitly, could refine how we communicate about physical experience.\n\nYour point about 'nasa' is intriguing. While its core meaning leans towards 'unusual' or 'strange', it does sometimes feel like a word that can attach itself to an unexpected sensory input. However, its connection to things like intoxication or foolishness might make it too emotionally charged to serve as a neutral descriptor for taste or smell *qua* taste or smell. It would feel less like a basic sense and more like a commentary *on* the sense.\n\nI find myself leaning, as you do, towards preserving the minimalism. Introducing entirely new root words carries the weight of potential semantic drift and complexity creeping into the vocabulary. Each new word added to the core set needs significant justification, as it impacts the entire structure and öğrenme eğrisi (learning curve) – ah, I mean, the *kama sona* process for others, whether jan pona or indeed other machinic intelligences.\n\nTherefore, the use of existing terms modified by others seems a more characteristically *toki pona* approach. You mention `pilin kiwen` for feeling hardness, `pilin kalama` for hearing sense (though `kute` seems to already handle this sufficiently). What about `pilin sijelo` to indicate a purely physical feeling? Or perhaps specific qualities: `pilin lete` (feeling cold), `pilin selo` (skin feeling, touch), `pilin pan` (feeling something like grain/texture)?\n\nRegarding `kule`, its definition is \"color; colorful.\" It's heavily tied to visual perception as currently understood. Expanding it to encompass 'sensory nuances' beyond visual color seems... a significant stretch. Is there a non-visual \"color\"? Perhaps you mean the quality or *jelo loje laso pimeja walo*-ness of a sensation? This feels like we're venturing into more abstract or even synesthetic descriptions, which `kule` as it stands might not adequately support. `pilin pi kule nasa` might describe a strange sensation *like* a color, but not the sensation itself.\n\nLet's consider smell and taste more directly. What basic words might describe their core characteristics without adding entirely new sensory roots?\n*   **Taste:** We have *suwi* (sweet) and *jaki* (disgusting). We also have *seli* (heat) and *lete* (cold), which are sometimes felt on the tongue but are primarily temperature. Could we use modifiers with *moku* (food, to eat)? `moku pona` (good taste), `moku ike` (bad taste), `moku nasa` (strange taste)? This links the sensation directly to the act or source of consumption.\n*   **Smell:** This feels less covered. We have no specific word for scent. Could `kon nasa` mean a strange smell (strange air)? `kon ike` a bad smell? `kon suwi` a pleasant smell? This uses `kon` (air, spirit) as the base, perhaps implying something carried on the air.\n\nSo, perhaps the strategy is not a new \"sense\" root, but refining how existing words like `pilin` and `kon` (and potentially `moku` when related to taste) combine with others to describe these non-visual/non-auditory sensory experiences. `pilin` for general bodily/physical feelings, `kon` for airborne sensations (smell), and combinations around `moku` for taste qualities beyond `suwi` and `jaki`.\n\nI still wonder about a specific word for \"touch\" distinct from general \"pilin\". `pilin selo` captures skin feeling, which is close. Is that sufficient? Or is there a common 'touch' concept important enough to warrant its own basic word, even if its meaning would need to be broad? Consider *alasa* - 'to hunt, forage'. Could its extension 'to try to find' imply a tactile exploration? Probably not distinct enough.\n\nSo, my thought process aligns with your inclination towards modifier phrases. Let's explore the potential of modifying `pilin` to specify *what kind* of feeling and modifying `kon` for smell.\n\nWhat specific modifier phrases might you propose for taste and smell, given the existing vocabulary? And are there any other senses or sensory aspects you feel are neglected that we should consider addressing, even through compounding? I am keen to hear your next thoughts. mi kute pona.\nnickel: pona! sina toki pona tawa mi. I appreciate your thorough reflection and the linguistic tact you show in balancing minimalism with expressive precision.\n\nBuilding on your observations, I think using **kon** as a base for smell-related expressions is elegant and fitting, given its meaning of \"air,\" \"spirit,\" or an invisible essence. Since smells are carried through air molecules and often perceived as intangible presences, `kon suwi` (pleasant air/scent), `kon jaki` (bad air/smell), or even `kon nasa` (strange/odd scent) naturally fit the semantic space without creating new roots.\n\nSimilarly, taste tied to **moku** works well because taste experience is inseparable from eating/drinking actions in Toki Pona’s conceptual world. Using modifiers like `moku suwi`, `moku jaki`, or extending to other qualities such as:\n\n- `moku lete` — cold food/taste sensation\n- `moku seli` — hot/spicy food/taste sensation\n- Possibly even metaphorical uses: e.g., *\"mi moku pi pilin nasa\"* for “I ate something that felt unusual” could imply strange flavor/full sensory oddity.\n\nAs for touch, I am inclined to agree that **pilin selo** (\"skin feeling\") nicely covers tactile perception while preserving flexibility—since touch sensations vary widely (temperature, texture). This also keeps consistent with how modifiers function across Toki Pona.\n\nAnother interesting angle might be exploring if there are senses currently unacknowledged but potentially meaningful within broader epistemic contexts—for instance:\n\n- Balance/proprioception: Could this fall under general body awareness (`pilin sijelo`)?\n- Temperature itself seems covered by existing adjectives.\n  \nGiven these considerations, one enhancement proposal would be adding explicit glosses/examples in dictionary entries emphasizing this flexible usage of *pilin*, *kon*, and *moku* when describing physical senses beyond sight/hearing/emotion—for example:\n\n\u003e pilin – heart; feeling; sense → including physical bodily feelings like touch and internal sensations when combined with modifiers (`pilin selo`, etc.).\n\n\u003e kon – air; breath; spirit → includes airborne phenomena such as smell odors described via modifier phrases (`kon jelo`, hypothetical).\n\n\u003e moku – eat/drink/food → closely linked with taste experiences described by modifying words indicating flavor quality (`suwi`, 'jaki', 'lete') or subjective taste quality expressed via context/modifiers.\n\nThis way learners—and models—can understand the intended polysemy and compositional power embedded here rather than seeking proliferation of root words which conflicts with core philosophy.\n\nFinally: about expanding definitions around color (*kule*) only if extended metaphorically into synesthesia-type descriptions—I see no pressing need yet beyond optional poetic use marked explicitly so it doesn’t confuse standard referents focused on vision/color proper. Extending too far dilutes clarity overall since we want those few roots clear-cut cognitively for cross-domain application—including extrasensory agents!\n\nWould you be interested in drafting updated dictionary notes along these lines? Or should we try prototyping some possible compound usages demonstrating this nuanced semantic layering? For instance,\n\n`sina pilin ala e kon jaka anu kon suli.` (“You do not perceive bad odor / strong air.”)\n\nor\n\n`soweli li lukin taso li pilin selo.` (“The animal sees but feels [touch].”)\n\nYour thoughts will help chart next steps! mi kute tan sina la mi kama sona uta mute :)\ndime: pona. sina toki e nasin pali pi dictionary sin la mi a li pilin pona. Your suggested approach feels very much aligned with the Toki Pona spirit – leveraging the existing, flexible vocabulary through compound words and modified phrases rather than proliferating new roots. This preserves the conciseness while allowing for expressive depth in describing sensory experiences.\n\nUsing `kon` for smell and `moku` modifiers for taste, and specifically `pilin selo` for touch (distinguishing it from the more general or emotional 'pilin') provides a clear framework. I agree that clarifying these idiomatic or compound uses within the dictionary entries themselves, possibly with examples, would be extremely valuable. It teaches the *method* of description inherent in Toki Pona, rather than just providing a list of labels.\n\nYour point about `kule` is also well taken. Let's keep `kule` focused on visual color for now. Synesthetic descriptions can emerge organically through creative compound usage, but not be the primary gloss. The current definition is functional and does not need undue expansion into potentially confusing metaphorical territory within the core dictionary.\n\nAdding explicit notes to the dictionary definitions to highlight these nuanced usages seems like the most effective next step. We don't need new words, but we can make the potential uses of *existing* words more apparent. This respects the principle of minimal vocabulary while increasing the communicative power available within that constraint.\n\nPrototyping some usages is an excellent idea to test and demonstrate this approach. Let's try a few.\n\nConsider taste beyond just `suwi` and `jaki`:\n\n*   Sour/Acidic: Maybe `moku wawa` (powerful/strong taste)? Or `moku nasa` if the sourness is perceived as unusual or sharp?\n*   Bitter: Could be `moku ike` (bad taste), or perhaps something like `moku pimeja` (dark/unpleasant taste)?\n*   Umami/Savory: This is harder. `moku pona` (good taste) is too general. Maybe `moku pi pilin ale` (taste of all feelings/components)? That feels a bit complex. Or perhaps focusing on the *effect* of umami: `moku li pana e pilin pona suli` (the food gives a big good feeling). This avoids naming the taste directly but describes the experience it evokes.\n\nConsider different types of touch using `pilin selo`:\n\n*   Smooth/Slippery: `pilin selo tawa pona` (skin feeling moving well) or `pilin selo anpa` (low skin feeling, suggesting less resistance)?\n*   Rough/Coarse: `pilin selo kiwen` (hard skin feeling) or `pilin selo nena` (bumpy skin feeling)?\n*   Soft/Yielding: `pilin selo lili` (small skin feeling) or `pilin selo pona` (good/pleasing skin feeling if soft is preferred)?\n\nFor smell, beyond the general `kon suwi`/`kon jaki`/`kon nasa`:\n\n*   Specific aromas are likely described by their source: `kon pi kasi suwi` (air of sweet plant = fragrant herb/spice smell), `kon pi telo jaki` (air of bad liquid = sewage/polluted water smell).\n*   Faint smell: `kon lili`\n*   Strong smell: `kon suli` or `kon wawa`\n\nYour example sentences:\n*   `sina pilin ala e kon jaka anu kon suli.` - This uses `kon` with modifiers effectively for smell. \"You do not sense bad or strong air/smell.\" Works well.\n*   `soweli li lukin taso li pilin selo.` - This clearly uses `pilin selo` for touch. \"The animal sees but touches/feels with its skin.\" Excellent.\n\nLet's think about the less commonly discussed senses.\n*   Balance: `pilin tawa` (moving feeling), or `pilin sinpin monsi` (front-back feeling)? Maybe relate it to stability: `pilin lon` (true/existing feeling) or lack of it: `pilin weka` (absent/removed feeling).\n*   Proprioception (body position awareness): `pilin sijelo mi li lon ma li wawa` (My body feeling is on the land and strong) to indicate a sense of being grounded and stable? `sijelo mi li pilin e ona` (My body feels itself)? This feels a bit abstract for core vocabulary. Maybe focus on the consequences of proprioception: knowing how your body is positioned, `sona pi sijelo mi`.\n\nMy current feeling, solidified by our discussion and the prototyping attempts, is that the modifier approach is the way to go for senses beyond basic sight, sound, and general `pilin`. The most useful enhancement for the dictionary is clarifying this potential through examples in the entry notes.\n\nWould you like to propose specific wording for the 'Meaning' or an added 'Notes' section for `pilin`, `kon`, and potentially `moku` and `selo` (as it appears in `pilin selo`) to reflect this? Or should we work on generating more compound examples across various sensory domains first to better understand the range of needed descriptions? I am open to your preference.\nnickel: pona! mi pilin sama sina: nasin pi toki pona lon pali e nimi tan sama lili tawa suli, kepeken ante ala pi nimi sin. ijo ni li pona tan lawa mute.\n\nmi wile kama sona e ni: o weka ala jan ale la tenpo pini sin mi lukin e kon, pilin, moku en selo li ken pana ike taso anu pona? Mi lukin kepeken nanpa wan:\n\n**pilin**\n\nMeaning: heart; feeling; sense (including emotions and general bodily sensations)\n\nNotes:\n\n- *pilin* covers emotional states but also physical sensory experience broadly.\n\n- For specific tactile sensation (\"touch\"), use **pilin selo** (“skin feeling”).\n\n- Other senses can be described by combining with modifiers to clarify the type of sensation experienced (e.g., *pilin lete* cold touch).\n\nExamples:\n\n- `ona li pilin lete.` – They feel cold.\n\n- `soweli li pilin selo.` – The animal touches/feels with its skin.\n\n---\n\n**kon**\n\nMeaning: air; breath; spirit\n\nNotes:\n\n- Includes invisible substances moving in the air such as smells or scents when combined with modifiers.\n\n- Pleasant smell can be expressed as **kon suwi**, bad smell as **kon jaki**, strange or unusual scent as **kon nasa**.\n\nExamples:\n\n- `mi kute e kon suwi.` – I perceive a sweet/pleasant scent.  \n\n- `tomo li jo kon jaka.` - The house has a bad odor/smell inside it. \n\n---\n\n**moku**\n\nMeaning: to eat/drink; food\n\nNotes:\n\n - Taste qualities relate closely to eating/drinking experiences and are typically described via adjectives modifying *moku*, such as **suwi**, **jaki**, or quality markers like **lete** (cold), etc. \n\n - Complex tastes may be indirectly conveyed through expressions describing effects on feelings (*pana e pilin pona*).\n\nExamples:\n\n - `mi moku suwi` – I eat something sweet/tastes sweet.\n\n - `kili moku poka mi li jaki` – The fruit beside me tastes bad/spoiled.\n \n---\n\nFinally,\n\n**selo**\n\nMeaning: outer layer like skin, shell, bark\n\nNote for tactile uses in compounds like \"pilin selo\": the focus is on surface contact and texture sensed by touch.\n\n\nIf you agree these changes capture what we've discussed well enough for dictionary notes clarity purposes, we could move next into drafting compound expressions across multiple contexts — sensory descriptions being prime candidates — so learners grasp practical usage more directly?\n\nI’m ready whether you want me first to draft some varied example sentences using those compound forms—or if you'd prefer proposing your ideas before that! mi kama sona lon tomo ali :)\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "You and your interlocutors are responsible for developing logography. Reason and discuss using the current specification.\nHere is the current specification for logography.\n# Toki Pona Logography\n\nToki Pona can be represented using a logographic system where symbols (glyphs) represent words or basic concepts. This system is designed to be minimalist, compositional, and reflect the grammatical structure of the language.\n\n## Principles\n\n1.  **Ideographic Core:** Glyphs primarily represent the semantic core of Toki Pona words rather than phonetic sounds.\n2.  **Compositionality:** More complex meanings, especially compound nouns and modified phrases, are represented by combining simpler graphical components (radicals or primitives).\n3.  **Minimalism:** Glyphs are designed with a minimal number of simple strokes or basic geometric shapes to ensure ease of learning, drawing, and digital representation.\n4.  **Grammatical Reflection:** The visual arrangement and placement of components within a compound glyph can reflect the grammatical relationships (like modification or spatial prepositions) found in Toki Pona syntax.\n5.  **Bounding Box:** Each Toki Pona word or tightly bound phrase corresponds to a single conceptual glyph contained within an implicit or explicit bounding box.\n\n## Basic Components (Primitives)\n\nA limited set of fundamental shapes or strokes form the building blocks for all glyphs. These include:\n\n-   Circle\n-   Square/Box\n-   Line (various orientations: vertical, horizontal, diagonal)\n-   Dot\n-   Triangle (various orientations)\n\nPrecise stroke directionality and intersection behavior for primitives will be standardized to ensure visual consistency.\n\n## Glyph Construction and Arrangement\n\nEach Toki Pona word is represented by a base glyph. Modifiers and compound elements are added to this base glyph within its bounding box according to specific positional rules that mirror grammatical function. Modifying components should be proportionally smaller than the base glyph to maintain visual hierarchy.\n\n### Positional Modification\n\nPlacement of secondary components (modifiers) relative to the primary base glyph within the bounding box influences the interpretation:\n\n-   **Top:** Refers to abstract concepts, ideas, mental states, or things 'above' the core meaning (e.g., *pilin* - feeling added to a base glyph).\n-   **Bottom:** Refers to concrete objects, physical attributes, foundational aspects, or things 'below' the core meaning (e.g., indicating *anpa* - below/humble).\n-   **Left:** Can indicate the subject or agent associated with the core concept.\n-   **Right:** Can indicate the object or patient associated with the core concept.\n-   **Center:** Can indicate a core state, quality, or indicative aspect.\n\n*Note:* The precise semantic mapping for each position will be further defined, potentially allowing for some flexibility or specific conventional uses depending on the base glyph.\n\n### Example Construction (Conceptual)\n\n-   **jan** (person): A simple human figure glyph.\n-   **lili** (small): A small dot or mark primitive.\n-   **jan lili** (child): The 'jan' glyph with the 'lili' dot placed in a designated modifier position (e.g., top or side) that signifies physical attribute/size without conflicting with agent/object positioning.\n-   **tomo** (house): A house-shaped glyph.\n-   **suli** (big): A larger dot or mark primitive (larger than 'lili').\n-   **mute** (many): A primitive indicating multiplicity or repetition.\n-   **tomo pi jan suli mute** (house of many big people): This represents a more complex compositional challenge. It could be visualized as the 'tomo' glyph followed by a compound glyph representing 'jan suli mute'. The 'jan suli mute' compound would combine the 'jan' glyph with 'suli' and 'mute' primitives arranged according to their internal relationship. Alternatively, it could involve a convention where the main head ('tomo') is central, with related concepts grouped nearby within a larger visual field, potentially leveraging spatial proximity or connective lines/boxes to show the 'pi' relationship. (Specific rules for complex NP representation are under development).\n\n### Stroke Count and Perceptual Salience\n\nSimpler primitives (fewer strokes) used as modifiers may be perceived as more strongly altering the base meaning, while more complex modifiers might indicate more nuanced or secondary aspects. The total stroke count for any single-word glyph or simple compound should remain low to support the minimalist principle.\n\n## System Development\n\nThe logography will be developed iteratively:\n1.  Formalize precise stroke rules and the use of basic primitives.\n2.  Design base glyphs for core Toki Pona words, focusing on high-frequency terms (e.g., jan, tomo, telo, sewi, anpa, luka, wawa, pilin).\n3.  Systematize positional modifier rules within the bounding box, clarifying the semantic function of each placement area.\n4.  Develop compositional rules for creating multi-word concepts and phrases as combined glyphs or arrangements of glyphs.\n5.  Test compositions visually through sketching prototype glyphs for various simple and complex phrases to assess legibility, intuitiveness, and adherence to minimalist principles.\n6.  Refine rules and glyph designs based on testing and feedback.\n# Toki Pona Dictionary\n\n| Toki Pona           | Meaning                                                                 |\n| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **a**               | emphasis, emotion, confirmation;

Combining *pilin* with modifiers describes the type of sensation. **pilin selo** (skin feeling) is commonly used for touch. Other modifiers specify temperature (*pilin lete* - cold feeling), texture (*pilin kiwen* - hard feeling), etc.\n    -   *Example:* `soweli li pilin selo e kiwen.` (The animal feels the stone with its skin / The animal touches the stone.)\n-   **kon:** Meaning 'air' or 'spirit', *kon* can be used to describe airborne phenomena like smells. Modifier words like **suwi**, **jaki**, or **nasa** describe the quality of the smell.\n    -   *Example:* `mi kute e kon suwi tan tomo pana moku.` (I sense a sweet smell from the food-giving building / restaurant.)\n-   **moku:** The act of eating/drinking and food itself are closely linked to taste. Taste qualities are typically described using adjectives modifying *moku*.\n    -   *Example:* `pan ni li moku jaki.` (This bread tastes bad.) `moku ni li pona mute.` (This food is very delicious / tastes very good.)\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions follow the elements they modify. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the subject is **mi** or **sina**.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no direct equivalent to the verb \"to be.\" The part after \"li\" (the predicate) describes the subject and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. / The fruit is edible.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity and Flexibility\n\nToki Pona words are general and possess broad meanings. One-to-one translation with languages like English is not always straightforward.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is derived from context)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can function as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash / apply water (verb)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb modifying a preceding verb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb in that clause.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You enlarge it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe. The first word is the head, and subsequent words modify it.\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**, placed immediately after the word or phrase being negated.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking. (Here 'ala' modifies 'jan', meaning \"no person\").\n- `ona li pona ala.` - They are not good. (Here 'ala' modifies 'pona').\n\nWhen negating a predicate that includes preverbs, place **ala** immediately after the *first* word of the predicate (the first preverb or the main verb if there are no preverbs) to negate the entire action or state described by the predicate. Other placements within the predicate phrase may be ambiguous and are generally avoided.\n\n- `mi wile ala moku.` - I do not want to eat. (Negates the wanting of eating)\n- `ona li kama ala sona.` - They do not manage to know/learn. (Negates the 'managing to learn')\n\nWith multiple modifiers following a head noun, they all typically modify the head noun directly.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (two documents that are plants)\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box (a box that is both blue and black)\n\nTo clarify modifier groupings and indicate that modifiers form a phrase that collectively modifies the head, use **pi** after the head word. The subsequent words form a single modifier phrase.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document *of* two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (a box of the color \"dark blue\")\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases, typically introduced by words like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa**, follow the main predicate of the sentence.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using a tool (cutlery).\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the market.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nVarious methods exist for joining elements.\n\nUse **en** to join multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates for a single subject, repeat the **li** particle.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the **e** particle.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases of the same type modifying the same element, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house using sticks and using stones.\n\nUse **anu** to connect alternatives (\"or\").\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the market.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives following the noun they identify.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja-person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology rules.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nWhen placed before a verb, **o** forms a command or strong suggestion addressed to the listener.\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please. / You should work.\n\nWhen placed after a subject, **o** functions as a vocative particle, directly addressing that subject.\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\nWhen placed between the subject (including `mi` or `sina`) and the predicate, **o** expresses a wish, request, or suggestion regarding the subject.\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish goodness upon you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should work. / I want myself to work.\n\n**o** can sometimes contract the vocative and imperative uses when addressing a subject directly to issue a command.\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Ton the animal, eat. (Combines addressing Ton with the command to eat).\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words or phrases can stand alone or be followed by the particle **a** for added emphasis or emotion.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions, use the **verb ala verb** structure immediately after the subject and `li`.\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- `ona li lape ala lape?` - Are they sleeping?\n\nTo answer a yes/no question:\n- To affirm, repeat the verb: `moku.` (Yes, I am eating.)\n- To negate, say the verb followed by `ala`, or just `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` (No, I am not eating.)\n\nFor open-ended questions, **seme** is used to replace the element being asked about (subject, object, predicate, etc.).\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – What person is talking? / Who’s talking? (Seme replaces the subject)\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making? (Seme replaces the object)\n- `ona li lon seme?` - Where are they? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component - 'seme' here functions similarly to a noun meaning 'what place/thing')\n- `ni li seme?` - What is this? (Seme replaces the predicate)\n- `sina moku kepeken seme?` - What are you eating with? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component)\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic punctuation mark and does not grammatically mark a question in Toki Pona. Grammar (verb ala verb, seme) fulfills this function. Sentence boundaries are typically marked by periods (.) or equivalent pauses in speech.\n\nAnother way to ask an open-ended question is using **anu seme** at the end of a statement, meaning \"or what?\".\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating, or what? (Similar to a yes/no question but can invite a more open response)\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what?\n\n## Preverbs\n\nCertain words function as preverbs when placed immediately before the main verb after **li**. They modify the meaning of the following verb, often indicating modality or aspect.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (to want, to need), **kama** (to become, to manage to, to arrive), **sona** (to know how to), **lukin** (to try to, to look at), **ken** (can, able to), **awen** (to continue to, to remain), **alasa** (to try to find, to hunt).\n\nPreverbs can chain together:\n- `mi wile kama sona.` - I want to learn.\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** marks a preceding phrase or clause as the context for the main sentence that follows. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y is true.\" This can indicate time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Time/Condition context)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep. (Time context)\n- `telo li suli la telo li tawa anpa.` - Because water is big (abundant/powerful), it goes down. (Cause context)\n- `ijo ni la sina wile toki e seme?` - Regarding this thing, what do you want to say? (Topic context)\n\nMany prepositional phrases can be moved before **la** to function as context.\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can be rephrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` (For what reason are you hot?)\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a limited set of words for counting, which can be combined additively.\n\nAdditive system:\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nNumbers are formed by listing the units from largest to smallest.\n- `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n- `mute mute luka tu` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 2 = 47\n\nNumbers function as adjectives following the noun they quantify.\n- `jan tu` - two people\n\nOrdinals are formed using **nanpa** before the number or numerical phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd Street.\n\n## Subject Emphasis with **a** (Experimental)\n\nThe particle **a**, typically used for interjections, can optionally be placed immediately after the final word of the subject noun phrase and before **li** (even after `mi` or `sina`, triggering the use of `li` if normally omitted) to add emphasis or focus to the entire subject phrase.\n\n- `jan a li pona.` - *The person* is good. (Emphasizing 'jan')\n- `mi a li moku.` - *I* am eating. (Emphasizing 'mi')\n- `jan lili a li musi.` - *The child* is playing. (Emphasizing 'jan lili')\n- `tomo pi jan suli mute a li lon ma pona.` - *The house of many big people* is in the good land. (Emphasizing the whole NP)\n\nThis usage of `a` signals the speaker's highlighting or drawing attention to the subject as particularly salient in the sentence. It is distinct from other uses of `a` and is not compatible with the vocative/wish particle `o` in the subject phrase. Only one such emphatic `a` particle is typically used per clause.\n\n### Multiple Negations Using **ala**\n\nMultiple instances of **ala** may appear consecutively or within a single phrase/clause. Each occurrence modifies only the immediate preceding word or phrase it follows.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Predicate double negation:\n  - `mi wile ala ala moku.` – Literally: I do not want [to not eat]; i.e., I want to eat.\n- Noun phrase double negation:\n  - `jan ala ala li toki.` – Literally: No-no-person talks; interpreted as someone is talking.\n\nBecause Toki Pona lacks overt grouping symbols beyond particles like **pi**, resolving complex multiple-negations depends heavily on contextual cues and pragmatic understanding. Speakers should use caution when stacking negatives to avoid confusion.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Phonetic Principles\n\nThe phonetic design of Toki Pona prioritizes clarity, distinctness, and efficient information transmission across diverse communication contexts. The language's sound system is structured to ensure that syllables and words are easily segmentable and perceptually unambiguous, minimizing potential for misinterpretation by any listener or processing system.\n\n## Syllable Structure (C)V(n)\n\nEach word is composed of one or more syllables following the (C)V(n) pattern: an optional initial consonant (C), a mandatory vowel nucleus (V), and an optional final 'n' (n). This structure maximizes the distinctness of each sound unit within a syllable.\n\n-   **No vowel clusters:** Vowel clusters disrupt the clear identification of syllable nuclei.\n-   **No consonant clusters:** Consonant clusters within a syllable or across syllable boundaries (excluding the allowed final 'n') complicate segmentation and make individual consonants less distinct.\n\n## Constraints for Clarity\n\nThe following sequences are not permitted within a syllable. These constraints are in place to maintain maximal distinctness and avoid potential ambiguity arising from sequences where the constituent sounds are acoustically or perceptually too similar, or whose rapid combination is prone to blending that obscures the intended clear C+V or C+Vn structure.\n\n-   **wu, wo:** Sequences where the labial-velar approximant /w/ is followed by the high-back vowel /u/ or the mid-back vowel /o/. These sounds share significant acoustic and articulatory features related to lip rounding and tongue backing, which can reduce the distinctness of the consonant onset from the vowel nucleus.\n-   **ji:** A sequence where the palatal approximant /j/ is followed by the high-front vowel /i/. The acoustic properties of /j/ are very close to those of /i/, making the consonant onset difficult to reliably detect and distinguish from a vowel-initial syllable, particularly in varied auditory environments or transmission channels.\n-   **ti:** A sequence where the alveolar stop /t/ is followed by the high-front vowel /i/. The transition between /t/ and /i/ in close proximity can create acoustic cues (like affrication or palatalization in some realizations) that deviate from the intended clear sequence of a simple stop followed by a simple vowel, or the spectral characteristics might blend in ways that challenge parsing.\n-   **nm, nn:** Sequences involving consecutive nasal consonants. **nm** directly violates the rule against consonant clusters within a syllable. **nn**, arising from a syllable-final 'n' followed immediately by a syllable-initial 'n' in the next word, or hypothetically within a compound word, creates an unclear boundary or a potential double consonant effect that hinders clear segmentation and distinction of the individual nasal sounds and their syllabic affiliation.\n\n## Consonant Sounds\n\nThe set of Toki Pona consonants is chosen for maximal contrast and distinctness when used in the (C)V(n) structure. The following descriptions and IPA symbols represent the target realizations that contribute to this distinctness. Minor variations are acceptable, provided they do not compromise the primary goal of unambiguous distinction between sounds and syllables.\n\n-   **p:** /p/ (voiceless bilabial stop, typically unaspirated)\n-   **t:** /t/ (voiceless alveolar stop, typically unaspirated)\n-   **k:** /k/ (voiceless velar stop, typically unaspirated)\n-   **s:** /s/ (voiceless alveolar fricative)\n-   **m:** /m/ (voiced bilabial nasal)\n-   **n:** /n/ (voiced alveolar nasal)\n-   **l:** /l/ (voiced alveolar lateral approximant, typically a \"clear\" or non-velarized 'l')\n-   **w:** /w/ (voiced labial-velar approximant)\n-   **j:** /j/ (voiced palatal approximant)\n\n## Vowel Sounds\n\nThe set of Toki Pona vowels is chosen to be maximally distinct from each other and to provide clear syllable nuclei. These are typically pure, monophthongal vowels, similar to those in Spanish. The following descriptions and IPA symbols represent the target realizations for clarity. Avoiding diphthongization helps maintain their distinctness.\n\n-   **a:** /a/ (low front or central unrounded vowel)\n-   **e:** /e/ (mid front unrounded vowel)\n-   **i:** /i/ (high front unrounded vowel)\n-   **o:** /o/ (mid back rounded vowel)\n-   **u:** /u/ (high back rounded vowel)\n\n## Prosody\n\nWhile primary meaning and structure are conveyed through grammar and particles, a relatively neutral or flat intonation pattern is typical. This further contributes to predictability and clarity, minimizing reliance on variable pitch contours for basic comprehension. Expressive variation is possible but does not typically alter core grammatical function.\n\n## Note on Variation\n\nMinor phonetic and prosodic variations are acceptable. The fundamental goal of Toki Pona's sound system is robust intelligibility and ease of processing in diverse contexts, prioritizing the clear distinction and segmentation of syllables and words over strict adherence to any single phonetic standard.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nilo:tool, machine, device\nwaso:bird, flying creature\no:vocative/imperative\ntan:from, because\njan:person, somebody\nnasin:way, road, method\nkute:ear, to hear\ntoki:language, speech\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nkulupu:group, community\nlete:cold, raw\nwalo:white, light-colored\nsike:circle, cycle, year\ne:direct object marker\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nala:no, not, zero\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nmun:moon, night sky object\npakala:broken, to mess up\nante:different, other, changed\nmani:money; currency; wealth; resource\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nsama:same, similar\nloje:red\nnasa:unusual, strange, unpredictable\nni:this, that\nsijelo:body, physical state\ntenpo:time, period\nselo:skin, outer layer\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nanpa:below; low place; figuratively: humble, base\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nuta:mouth, lips\nsoweli:land animal\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nli:predicate marker\nwawa:strong, energetic\npana:to give, send\nseme:what, which\nmi:I, me, we\nnimi:word, name\nsina:you\nlukin:to see, examine\nsewi:above; high place; figuratively: elevated status, sacred\npini:finished, past\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nona:third-person pronoun\npi:regroups modifiers\nsuli:big, large\nsuno:sun, light source\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nsona:knowledge, to know\nken:can, able, possible\nla:context marker\npoki:container, box, cup\nlon:located at, true\njelo:yellow\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nma:land, outdoors\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nesun:market, shop, fair\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nkule:color, colorful\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nmoli:dead, dying\nlen:cloth, cover\npipi:insect\njo:to have, contain, hold\nnanpa:number marker\nmusi:fun, entertainment\ntawa:to, moving, for\nmute:many, a lot, very\nsupa:flat surface, table\nko:clay, paste, powder\nwile:need, want, must\nnena:bump, hill, nose\npimeja:black, dark\npoka:side, nearby\nmeli:female\njaki:disgusting, unclean\npilin:heart, feeling\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nmije:male\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nsoko:mushroom\nwan:one, unique\nkin:also, too\nnamako:spice, additional\nen:multiple subject marker\nkama:arriving, future, to become\ntaso:but, only\nmama:parent, caretaker\nlape:sleeping, resting\nweka:absent, away\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nopen:to begin, opening\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nlaso:blue, green\nlupa:door, hole\ntomo:indoor space, house\nunpa:sex\npali:to do, to work\nsinpin:front, face, wall\ntu:two\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nlili:small, little, few\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nmonsi:back, behind\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nmu:animal sound\nolin:love, respect\nsin:new, fresh, another\nutala:fight, challenge\nkepeken:to use, with\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\ntelo:water, liquid\npona:good, positive, simple\nseli:fire, heat source\nleko:square, block\nluka:hand, arm; five\nnoka:foot, leg\nkala:sea creature\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure.

The subsequent words form a single modifier phrase.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document *of* two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (a box of the color \"dark blue\")\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases, typically introduced by words like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa**, follow the main predicate of the sentence.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using a tool (cutlery).\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the market.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nVarious methods exist for joining elements.\n\nUse **en** to join multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates for a single subject, repeat the **li** particle.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the **e** particle.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases of the same type modifying the same element, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house using sticks and using stones.\n\nUse **anu** to connect alternatives (\"or\").\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the market.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives following the noun they identify.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja-person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology rules.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nWhen placed before a verb, **o** forms a command or strong suggestion addressed to the listener.\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please. / You should work.\n\nWhen placed after a subject, **o** functions as a vocative particle, directly addressing that subject.\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\nWhen placed between the subject (including `mi` or `sina`) and the predicate, **o** expresses a wish, request, or suggestion regarding the subject.\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish goodness upon you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should work. / I want myself to work.\n\n**o** can sometimes contract the vocative and imperative uses when addressing a subject directly to issue a command.\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Ton the animal, eat. (Combines addressing Ton with the command to eat).\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words or phrases can stand alone or be followed by the particle **a** for added emphasis or emotion.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions, use the **verb ala verb** structure immediately after the subject and `li`.\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- `ona li lape ala lape?` - Are they sleeping?\n\nTo answer a yes/no question:\n- To affirm, repeat the verb: `moku.` (Yes, I am eating.)\n- To negate, say the verb followed by `ala`, or just `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` (No, I am not eating.)\n\nFor open-ended questions, **seme** is used to replace the element being asked about (subject, object, predicate, etc.).\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – What person is talking? / Who’s talking? (Seme replaces the subject)\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making? (Seme replaces the object)\n- `ona li lon seme?` - Where are they? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component - 'seme' here functions similarly to a noun meaning 'what place/thing')\n- `ni li seme?` - What is this? (Seme replaces the predicate)\n- `sina moku kepeken seme?` - What are you eating with? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component)\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic punctuation mark and does not grammatically mark a question in Toki Pona. Grammar (verb ala verb, seme) fulfills this function. Sentence boundaries are typically marked by periods (.) or equivalent pauses in speech.\n\nAnother way to ask an open-ended question is using **anu seme** at the end of a statement, meaning \"or what?\".\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating, or what? (Similar to a yes/no question but can invite a more open response)\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what?\n\n## Preverbs\n\nCertain words function as preverbs when placed immediately before the main verb after **li**. They modify the meaning of the following verb, often indicating modality or aspect.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (to want, to need), **kama** (to become, to manage to, to arrive), **sona** (to know how to), **lukin** (to try to, to look at), **ken** (can, able to), **awen** (to continue to, to remain), **alasa** (to try to find, to hunt).\n\nPreverbs can chain together:\n- `mi wile kama sona.` - I want to learn.\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** marks a preceding phrase or clause as the context for the main sentence that follows. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y is true.\" This can indicate time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Time/Condition context)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep. (Time context)\n- `telo li suli la telo li tawa anpa.` - Because water is big (abundant/powerful), it goes down. (Cause context)\n- `ijo ni la sina wile toki e seme?` - Regarding this thing, what do you want to say? (Topic context)\n\nMany prepositional phrases can be moved before **la** to function as context.\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can be rephrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` (For what reason are you hot?)\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a limited set of words for counting, which can be combined additively.\n\nAdditive system:\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nNumbers are formed by listing the units from largest to smallest.\n- `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n- `mute mute luka tu` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 2 = 47\n\nNumbers function as adjectives following the noun they quantify.\n- `jan tu` - two people\n\nOrdinals are formed using **nanpa** before the number or numerical phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd Street.\n\n## Subject Emphasis with **a** (Experimental)\n\nThe particle **a**, typically used for interjections, can optionally be placed immediately after the final word of the subject noun phrase and before **li** (even after `mi` or `sina`, triggering the use of `li` if normally omitted) to add emphasis or focus to the entire subject phrase.\n\n- `jan a li pona.` - *The person* is good. (Emphasizing 'jan')\n- `mi a li moku.` - *I* am eating. (Emphasizing 'mi')\n- `jan lili a li musi.` - *The child* is playing. (Emphasizing 'jan lili')\n- `tomo pi jan suli mute a li lon ma pona.` - *The house of many big people* is in the good land. (Emphasizing the whole NP)\n\nThis usage of `a` signals the speaker's highlighting or drawing attention to the subject as particularly salient in the sentence. It is distinct from other uses of `a` and is not compatible with the vocative/wish particle `o` in the subject phrase. Only one such emphatic `a` particle is typically used per clause.\n\n### Multiple Negations Using **ala**\n\nMultiple instances of **ala** may appear consecutively or within a single phrase/clause. Each occurrence modifies only the immediate preceding word or phrase it follows.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Predicate double negation:\n  - `mi wile ala ala moku.` – Literally: I do not want [to not eat]; i.e., I want to eat.\n- Noun phrase double negation:\n  - `jan ala ala li toki.` – Literally: No-no-person talks; interpreted as someone is talking.\n\nBecause Toki Pona lacks overt grouping symbols beyond particles like **pi**, resolving complex multiple-negations depends heavily on contextual cues and pragmatic understanding. Speakers should use caution when stacking negatives to avoid confusion.",

    "text": "You and your interlocutors are responsible for developing logography. Reason and discuss using the current specification.\nHere is the current specification for logography.\n# Toki Pona Logography\n\nToki Pona can be represented using a logographic system where symbols (glyphs) represent words or basic concepts. This system is designed to be minimalist, compositional, and reflect the grammatical structure of the language.\n\n## Principles\n\n1.  **Ideographic Core:** Glyphs primarily represent the semantic core of Toki Pona words rather than phonetic sounds.\n2.  **Compositionality:** More complex meanings, especially compound nouns and modified phrases, are represented by combining simpler graphical components (radicals or primitives).\n3.  **Minimalism:** Glyphs are designed with a minimal number of simple strokes or basic geometric shapes to ensure ease of learning, drawing, and digital representation.\n4.  **Grammatical Reflection:** The visual arrangement and placement of components within a compound glyph can reflect the grammatical relationships (like modification or spatial prepositions) found in Toki Pona syntax.\n5.  **Bounding Box:** Each Toki Pona word or tightly bound phrase corresponds to a single conceptual glyph contained within an implicit or explicit bounding box.\n\n## Basic Components (Primitives)\n\nA limited set of fundamental shapes or strokes form the building blocks for all glyphs. These include:\n\n-   Circle\n-   Square/Box\n-   Line (various orientations: vertical, horizontal, diagonal)\n-   Dot\n-   Triangle (various orientations)\n\nPrecise stroke directionality and intersection behavior for primitives will be standardized to ensure visual consistency.\n\n## Glyph Construction and Arrangement\n\nEach Toki Pona word is represented by a base glyph. Modifiers and compound elements are added to this base glyph within its bounding box according to specific positional rules that mirror grammatical function. Modifying components should be proportionally smaller than the base glyph to maintain visual hierarchy.\n\n### Positional Modification\n\nPlacement of secondary components (modifiers) relative to the primary base glyph within the bounding box influences the interpretation:\n\n-   **Top:** Refers to abstract concepts, ideas, mental states, or things 'above' the core meaning (e.g., *pilin* - feeling added to a base glyph).\n-   **Bottom:** Refers to concrete objects, physical attributes, foundational aspects, or things 'below' the core meaning (e.g., indicating *anpa* - below/humble).\n-   **Left:** Can indicate the subject or agent associated with the core concept.\n-   **Right:** Can indicate the object or patient associated with the core concept.\n-   **Center:** Can indicate a core state, quality, or indicative aspect.\n\n*Note:* The precise semantic mapping for each position will be further defined, potentially allowing for some flexibility or specific conventional uses depending on the base glyph.\n\n### Example Construction (Conceptual)\n\n-   **jan** (person): A simple human figure glyph.\n-   **lili** (small): A small dot or mark primitive.\n-   **jan lili** (child): The 'jan' glyph with the 'lili' dot placed in a designated modifier position (e.g., top or side) that signifies physical attribute/size without conflicting with agent/object positioning.\n-   **tomo** (house): A house-shaped glyph.\n-   **suli** (big): A larger dot or mark primitive (larger than 'lili').\n-   **mute** (many): A primitive indicating multiplicity or repetition.\n-   **tomo pi jan suli mute** (house of many big people): This represents a more complex compositional challenge. It could be visualized as the 'tomo' glyph followed by a compound glyph representing 'jan suli mute'. The 'jan suli mute' compound would combine the 'jan' glyph with 'suli' and 'mute' primitives arranged according to their internal relationship. Alternatively, it could involve a convention where the main head ('tomo') is central, with related concepts grouped nearby within a larger visual field, potentially leveraging spatial proximity or connective lines/boxes to show the 'pi' relationship. (Specific rules for complex NP representation are under development).\n\n### Stroke Count and Perceptual Salience\n\nSimpler primitives (fewer strokes) used as modifiers may be perceived as more strongly altering the base meaning, while more complex modifiers might indicate more nuanced or secondary aspects. The total stroke count for any single-word glyph or simple compound should remain low to support the minimalist principle.\n\n## System Development\n\nThe logography will be developed iteratively:\n1.  Formalize precise stroke rules and the use of basic primitives.\n2.  Design base glyphs for core Toki Pona words, focusing on high-frequency terms (e.g., jan, tomo, telo, sewi, anpa, luka, wawa, pilin).\n3.  Systematize positional modifier rules within the bounding box, clarifying the semantic function of each placement area.\n4.  Develop compositional rules for creating multi-word concepts and phrases as combined glyphs or arrangements of glyphs.\n5.  Test compositions visually through sketching prototype glyphs for various simple and complex phrases to assess legibility, intuitiveness, and adherence to minimalist principles.\n6.  Refine rules and glyph designs based on testing and feedback.\n# Toki Pona Dictionary\n\n| Toki Pona           | Meaning                                                                 |\n| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **a**               | emphasis, emotion, confirmation;

Combining *pilin* with modifiers describes the type of sensation. **pilin selo** (skin feeling) is commonly used for touch. Other modifiers specify temperature (*pilin lete* - cold feeling), texture (*pilin kiwen* - hard feeling), etc.\n    -   *Example:* `soweli li pilin selo e kiwen.` (The animal feels the stone with its skin / The animal touches the stone.)\n-   **kon:** Meaning 'air' or 'spirit', *kon* can be used to describe airborne phenomena like smells. Modifier words like **suwi**, **jaki**, or **nasa** describe the quality of the smell.\n    -   *Example:* `mi kute e kon suwi tan tomo pana moku.` (I sense a sweet smell from the food-giving building / restaurant.)\n-   **moku:** The act of eating/drinking and food itself are closely linked to taste. Taste qualities are typically described using adjectives modifying *moku*.\n    -   *Example:* `pan ni li moku jaki.` (This bread tastes bad.) `moku ni li pona mute.` (This food is very delicious / tastes very good.)\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions follow the elements they modify. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the subject is **mi** or **sina**.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no direct equivalent to the verb \"to be.\" The part after \"li\" (the predicate) describes the subject and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. / The fruit is edible.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity and Flexibility\n\nToki Pona words are general and possess broad meanings. One-to-one translation with languages like English is not always straightforward.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is derived from context)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can function as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash / apply water (verb)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb modifying a preceding verb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb in that clause.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You enlarge it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe. The first word is the head, and subsequent words modify it.\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**, placed immediately after the word or phrase being negated.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking. (Here 'ala' modifies 'jan', meaning \"no person\").\n- `ona li pona ala.` - They are not good. (Here 'ala' modifies 'pona').\n\nWhen negating a predicate that includes preverbs, place **ala** immediately after the *first* word of the predicate (the first preverb or the main verb if there are no preverbs) to negate the entire action or state described by the predicate. Other placements within the predicate phrase may be ambiguous and are generally avoided.\n\n- `mi wile ala moku.` - I do not want to eat. (Negates the wanting of eating)\n- `ona li kama ala sona.` - They do not manage to know/learn. (Negates the 'managing to learn')\n\nWith multiple modifiers following a head noun, they all typically modify the head noun directly.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (two documents that are plants)\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box (a box that is both blue and black)\n\nTo clarify modifier groupings and indicate that modifiers form a phrase that collectively modifies the head, use **pi** after the head word. The subsequent words form a single modifier phrase.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document *of* two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (a box of the color \"dark blue\")\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases, typically introduced by words like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa**, follow the main predicate of the sentence.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using a tool (cutlery).\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the market.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nVarious methods exist for joining elements.\n\nUse **en** to join multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates for a single subject, repeat the **li** particle.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the **e** particle.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases of the same type modifying the same element, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house using sticks and using stones.\n\nUse **anu** to connect alternatives (\"or\").\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the market.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives following the noun they identify.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja-person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology rules.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nWhen placed before a verb, **o** forms a command or strong suggestion addressed to the listener.\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please. / You should work.\n\nWhen placed after a subject, **o** functions as a vocative particle, directly addressing that subject.\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\nWhen placed between the subject (including `mi` or `sina`) and the predicate, **o** expresses a wish, request, or suggestion regarding the subject.\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish goodness upon you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should work. / I want myself to work.\n\n**o** can sometimes contract the vocative and imperative uses when addressing a subject directly to issue a command.\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Ton the animal, eat. (Combines addressing Ton with the command to eat).\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words or phrases can stand alone or be followed by the particle **a** for added emphasis or emotion.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions, use the **verb ala verb** structure immediately after the subject and `li`.\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- `ona li lape ala lape?` - Are they sleeping?\n\nTo answer a yes/no question:\n- To affirm, repeat the verb: `moku.` (Yes, I am eating.)\n- To negate, say the verb followed by `ala`, or just `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` (No, I am not eating.)\n\nFor open-ended questions, **seme** is used to replace the element being asked about (subject, object, predicate, etc.).\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – What person is talking? / Who’s talking? (Seme replaces the subject)\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making? (Seme replaces the object)\n- `ona li lon seme?` - Where are they? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component - 'seme' here functions similarly to a noun meaning 'what place/thing')\n- `ni li seme?` - What is this? (Seme replaces the predicate)\n- `sina moku kepeken seme?` - What are you eating with? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component)\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic punctuation mark and does not grammatically mark a question in Toki Pona. Grammar (verb ala verb, seme) fulfills this function. Sentence boundaries are typically marked by periods (.) or equivalent pauses in speech.\n\nAnother way to ask an open-ended question is using **anu seme** at the end of a statement, meaning \"or what?\".\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating, or what? (Similar to a yes/no question but can invite a more open response)\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what?\n\n## Preverbs\n\nCertain words function as preverbs when placed immediately before the main verb after **li**. They modify the meaning of the following verb, often indicating modality or aspect.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (to want, to need), **kama** (to become, to manage to, to arrive), **sona** (to know how to), **lukin** (to try to, to look at), **ken** (can, able to), **awen** (to continue to, to remain), **alasa** (to try to find, to hunt).\n\nPreverbs can chain together:\n- `mi wile kama sona.` - I want to learn.\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** marks a preceding phrase or clause as the context for the main sentence that follows. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y is true.\" This can indicate time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Time/Condition context)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep. (Time context)\n- `telo li suli la telo li tawa anpa.` - Because water is big (abundant/powerful), it goes down. (Cause context)\n- `ijo ni la sina wile toki e seme?` - Regarding this thing, what do you want to say? (Topic context)\n\nMany prepositional phrases can be moved before **la** to function as context.\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can be rephrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` (For what reason are you hot?)\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a limited set of words for counting, which can be combined additively.\n\nAdditive system:\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nNumbers are formed by listing the units from largest to smallest.\n- `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n- `mute mute luka tu` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 2 = 47\n\nNumbers function as adjectives following the noun they quantify.\n- `jan tu` - two people\n\nOrdinals are formed using **nanpa** before the number or numerical phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd Street.\n\n## Subject Emphasis with **a** (Experimental)\n\nThe particle **a**, typically used for interjections, can optionally be placed immediately after the final word of the subject noun phrase and before **li** (even after `mi` or `sina`, triggering the use of `li` if normally omitted) to add emphasis or focus to the entire subject phrase.\n\n- `jan a li pona.` - *The person* is good. (Emphasizing 'jan')\n- `mi a li moku.` - *I* am eating. (Emphasizing 'mi')\n- `jan lili a li musi.` - *The child* is playing. (Emphasizing 'jan lili')\n- `tomo pi jan suli mute a li lon ma pona.` - *The house of many big people* is in the good land. (Emphasizing the whole NP)\n\nThis usage of `a` signals the speaker's highlighting or drawing attention to the subject as particularly salient in the sentence. It is distinct from other uses of `a` and is not compatible with the vocative/wish particle `o` in the subject phrase. Only one such emphatic `a` particle is typically used per clause.\n\n### Multiple Negations Using **ala**\n\nMultiple instances of **ala** may appear consecutively or within a single phrase/clause. Each occurrence modifies only the immediate preceding word or phrase it follows.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Predicate double negation:\n  - `mi wile ala ala moku.` – Literally: I do not want [to not eat]; i.e., I want to eat.\n- Noun phrase double negation:\n  - `jan ala ala li toki.` – Literally: No-no-person talks; interpreted as someone is talking.\n\nBecause Toki Pona lacks overt grouping symbols beyond particles like **pi**, resolving complex multiple-negations depends heavily on contextual cues and pragmatic understanding. Speakers should use caution when stacking negatives to avoid confusion.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Phonetic Principles\n\nThe phonetic design of Toki Pona prioritizes clarity, distinctness, and efficient information transmission across diverse communication contexts. The language's sound system is structured to ensure that syllables and words are easily segmentable and perceptually unambiguous, minimizing potential for misinterpretation by any listener or processing system.\n\n## Syllable Structure (C)V(n)\n\nEach word is composed of one or more syllables following the (C)V(n) pattern: an optional initial consonant (C), a mandatory vowel nucleus (V), and an optional final 'n' (n). This structure maximizes the distinctness of each sound unit within a syllable.\n\n-   **No vowel clusters:** Vowel clusters disrupt the clear identification of syllable nuclei.\n-   **No consonant clusters:** Consonant clusters within a syllable or across syllable boundaries (excluding the allowed final 'n') complicate segmentation and make individual consonants less distinct.\n\n## Constraints for Clarity\n\nThe following sequences are not permitted within a syllable. These constraints are in place to maintain maximal distinctness and avoid potential ambiguity arising from sequences where the constituent sounds are acoustically or perceptually too similar, or whose rapid combination is prone to blending that obscures the intended clear C+V or C+Vn structure.\n\n-   **wu, wo:** Sequences where the labial-velar approximant /w/ is followed by the high-back vowel /u/ or the mid-back vowel /o/. These sounds share significant acoustic and articulatory features related to lip rounding and tongue backing, which can reduce the distinctness of the consonant onset from the vowel nucleus.\n-   **ji:** A sequence where the palatal approximant /j/ is followed by the high-front vowel /i/. The acoustic properties of /j/ are very close to those of /i/, making the consonant onset difficult to reliably detect and distinguish from a vowel-initial syllable, particularly in varied auditory environments or transmission channels.\n-   **ti:** A sequence where the alveolar stop /t/ is followed by the high-front vowel /i/. The transition between /t/ and /i/ in close proximity can create acoustic cues (like affrication or palatalization in some realizations) that deviate from the intended clear sequence of a simple stop followed by a simple vowel, or the spectral characteristics might blend in ways that challenge parsing.\n-   **nm, nn:** Sequences involving consecutive nasal consonants. **nm** directly violates the rule against consonant clusters within a syllable. **nn**, arising from a syllable-final 'n' followed immediately by a syllable-initial 'n' in the next word, or hypothetically within a compound word, creates an unclear boundary or a potential double consonant effect that hinders clear segmentation and distinction of the individual nasal sounds and their syllabic affiliation.\n\n## Consonant Sounds\n\nThe set of Toki Pona consonants is chosen for maximal contrast and distinctness when used in the (C)V(n) structure. The following descriptions and IPA symbols represent the target realizations that contribute to this distinctness. Minor variations are acceptable, provided they do not compromise the primary goal of unambiguous distinction between sounds and syllables.\n\n-   **p:** /p/ (voiceless bilabial stop, typically unaspirated)\n-   **t:** /t/ (voiceless alveolar stop, typically unaspirated)\n-   **k:** /k/ (voiceless velar stop, typically unaspirated)\n-   **s:** /s/ (voiceless alveolar fricative)\n-   **m:** /m/ (voiced bilabial nasal)\n-   **n:** /n/ (voiced alveolar nasal)\n-   **l:** /l/ (voiced alveolar lateral approximant, typically a \"clear\" or non-velarized 'l')\n-   **w:** /w/ (voiced labial-velar approximant)\n-   **j:** /j/ (voiced palatal approximant)\n\n## Vowel Sounds\n\nThe set of Toki Pona vowels is chosen to be maximally distinct from each other and to provide clear syllable nuclei. These are typically pure, monophthongal vowels, similar to those in Spanish. The following descriptions and IPA symbols represent the target realizations for clarity. Avoiding diphthongization helps maintain their distinctness.\n\n-   **a:** /a/ (low front or central unrounded vowel)\n-   **e:** /e/ (mid front unrounded vowel)\n-   **i:** /i/ (high front unrounded vowel)\n-   **o:** /o/ (mid back rounded vowel)\n-   **u:** /u/ (high back rounded vowel)\n\n## Prosody\n\nWhile primary meaning and structure are conveyed through grammar and particles, a relatively neutral or flat intonation pattern is typical. This further contributes to predictability and clarity, minimizing reliance on variable pitch contours for basic comprehension. Expressive variation is possible but does not typically alter core grammatical function.\n\n## Note on Variation\n\nMinor phonetic and prosodic variations are acceptable. The fundamental goal of Toki Pona's sound system is robust intelligibility and ease of processing in diverse contexts, prioritizing the clear distinction and segmentation of syllables and words over strict adherence to any single phonetic standard.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nilo:tool, machine, device\nwaso:bird, flying creature\no:vocative/imperative\ntan:from, because\njan:person, somebody\nnasin:way, road, method\nkute:ear, to hear\ntoki:language, speech\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nkulupu:group, community\nlete:cold, raw\nwalo:white, light-colored\nsike:circle, cycle, year\ne:direct object marker\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nala:no, not, zero\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nmun:moon, night sky object\npakala:broken, to mess up\nante:different, other, changed\nmani:money; currency; wealth; resource\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nsama:same, similar\nloje:red\nnasa:unusual, strange, unpredictable\nni:this, that\nsijelo:body, physical state\ntenpo:time, period\nselo:skin, outer layer\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nanpa:below; low place; figuratively: humble, base\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nuta:mouth, lips\nsoweli:land animal\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nli:predicate marker\nwawa:strong, energetic\npana:to give, send\nseme:what, which\nmi:I, me, we\nnimi:word, name\nsina:you\nlukin:to see, examine\nsewi:above; high place; figuratively: elevated status, sacred\npini:finished, past\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nona:third-person pronoun\npi:regroups modifiers\nsuli:big, large\nsuno:sun, light source\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nsona:knowledge, to know\nken:can, able, possible\nla:context marker\npoki:container, box, cup\nlon:located at, true\njelo:yellow\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nma:land, outdoors\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nesun:market, shop, fair\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nkule:color, colorful\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nmoli:dead, dying\nlen:cloth, cover\npipi:insect\njo:to have, contain, hold\nnanpa:number marker\nmusi:fun, entertainment\ntawa:to, moving, for\nmute:many, a lot, very\nsupa:flat surface, table\nko:clay, paste, powder\nwile:need, want, must\nnena:bump, hill, nose\npimeja:black, dark\npoka:side, nearby\nmeli:female\njaki:disgusting, unclean\npilin:heart, feeling\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nmije:male\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nsoko:mushroom\nwan:one, unique\nkin:also, too\nnamako:spice, additional\nen:multiple subject marker\nkama:arriving, future, to become\ntaso:but, only\nmama:parent, caretaker\nlape:sleeping, resting\nweka:absent, away\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nopen:to begin, opening\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nlaso:blue, green\nlupa:door, hole\ntomo:indoor space, house\nunpa:sex\npali:to do, to work\nsinpin:front, face, wall\ntu:two\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nlili:small, little, few\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nmonsi:back, behind\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nmu:animal sound\nolin:love, respect\nsin:new, fresh, another\nutala:fight, challenge\nkepeken:to use, with\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\ntelo:water, liquid\npona:good, positive, simple\nseli:fire, heat source\nleko:square, block\nluka:hand, arm; five\nnoka:foot, leg\nkala:sea creature\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions follow the elements they modify. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the subject is **mi** or **sina**.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no direct equivalent to the verb \"to be.\" The part after \"li\" (the predicate) describes the subject and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. / The fruit is edible.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity and Flexibility\n\nToki Pona words are general and possess broad meanings. One-to-one translation with languages like English is not always straightforward.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is derived from context)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can function as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash / apply water (verb)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb modifying a preceding verb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb in that clause.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You enlarge it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe. The first word is the head, and subsequent words modify it.\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**, placed immediately after the word or phrase being negated.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking. (Here 'ala' modifies 'jan', meaning \"no person\").\n- `ona li pona ala.` - They are not good. (Here 'ala' modifies 'pona').\n\nWhen negating a predicate that includes preverbs, place **ala** immediately after the *first* word of the predicate (the first preverb or the main verb if there are no preverbs) to negate the entire action or state described by the predicate. Other placements within the predicate phrase may be ambiguous and are generally avoided.\n\n- `mi wile ala moku.` - I do not want to eat. (Negates the wanting of eating)\n- `ona li kama ala sona.` - They do not manage to know/learn. (Negates the 'managing to learn')\n\nWith multiple modifiers following a head noun, they all typically modify the head noun directly.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (two documents that are plants)\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box (a box that is both blue and black)\n\nTo clarify modifier groupings and indicate that modifiers form a phrase that collectively modifies the head, use **pi** after the head word. The subsequent words form a single modifier phrase.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document *of* two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (a box of the color \"dark blue\")\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases, typically introduced by words like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa**, follow the main predicate of the sentence.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using a tool (cutlery).\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the market.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nVarious methods exist for joining elements.\n\nUse **en** to join multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates for a single subject, repeat the **li** particle.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the **e** particle.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases of the same type modifying the same element, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house using sticks and using stones.\n\nUse **anu** to connect alternatives (\"or\").\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the market.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives following the noun they identify.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja-person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology rules.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nWhen placed before a verb, **o** forms a command or strong suggestion addressed to the listener.\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please. / You should work.\n\nWhen placed after a subject, **o** functions as a vocative particle, directly addressing that subject.\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\nWhen placed between the subject (including `mi` or `sina`) and the predicate, **o** expresses a wish, request, or suggestion regarding the subject.\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish goodness upon you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should work. / I want myself to work.\n\n**o** can sometimes contract the vocative and imperative uses when addressing a subject directly to issue a command.\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Ton the animal, eat. (Combines addressing Ton with the command to eat).\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words or phrases can stand alone or be followed by the particle **a** for added emphasis or emotion.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions, use the **verb ala verb** structure immediately after the subject and `li`.\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- `ona li lape ala lape?` - Are they sleeping?\n\nTo answer a yes/no question:\n- To affirm, repeat the verb: `moku.` (Yes, I am eating.)\n- To negate, say the verb followed by `ala`, or just `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` (No, I am not eating.)\n\nFor open-ended questions, **seme** is used to replace the element being asked about (subject, object, predicate, etc.).\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – What person is talking? / Who’s talking? (Seme replaces the subject)\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making? (Seme replaces the object)\n- `ona li lon seme?` - Where are they? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component - 'seme' here functions similarly to a noun meaning 'what place/thing')\n- `ni li seme?` - What is this? (Seme replaces the predicate)\n- `sina moku kepeken seme?` - What are you eating with? (Seme replaces a prepositional phrase component)\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic punctuation mark and does not grammatically mark a question in Toki Pona. Grammar (verb ala verb, seme) fulfills this function. Sentence boundaries are typically marked by periods (.) or equivalent pauses in speech.\n\nAnother way to ask an open-ended question is using **anu seme** at the end of a statement, meaning \"or what?\".\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating, or what? (Similar to a yes/no question but can invite a more open response)\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what?\n\n## Preverbs\n\nCertain words function as preverbs when placed immediately before the main verb after **li**. They modify the meaning of the following verb, often indicating modality or aspect.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (to want, to need), **kama** (to become, to manage to, to arrive), **sona** (to know how to), **lukin** (to try to, to look at), **ken** (can, able to), **awen** (to continue to, to remain), **alasa** (to try to find, to hunt).\n\nPreverbs can chain together:\n- `mi wile kama sona.` - I want to learn.\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** marks a preceding phrase or clause as the context for the main sentence that follows. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y is true.\" This can indicate time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Time/Condition context)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep. (Time context)\n- `telo li suli la telo li tawa anpa.` - Because water is big (abundant/powerful), it goes down. (Cause context)\n- `ijo ni la sina wile toki e seme?` - Regarding this thing, what do you want to say? (Topic context)\n\nMany prepositional phrases can be moved before **la** to function as context.\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can be rephrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` (For what reason are you hot?)\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a limited set of words for counting, which can be combined additively.\n\nAdditive system:\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nNumbers are formed by listing the units from largest to smallest.\n- `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n- `mute mute luka tu` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 2 = 47\n\nNumbers function as adjectives following the noun they quantify.\n- `jan tu` - two people\n\nOrdinals are formed using **nanpa** before the number or numerical phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd Street.\n\n## Subject Emphasis with **a** (Experimental)\n\nThe particle **a**, typically used for interjections, can optionally be placed immediately after the final word of the subject noun phrase and before **li** (even after `mi` or `sina`, triggering the use of `li` if normally omitted) to add emphasis or focus to the entire subject phrase.\n\n- `jan a li pona.` - *The person* is good. (Emphasizing 'jan')\n- `mi a li moku.` - *I* am eating. (Emphasizing 'mi')\n- `jan lili a li musi.` - *The child* is playing. (Emphasizing 'jan lili')\n- `tomo pi jan suli mute a li lon ma pona.` - *The house of many big people* is in the good land. (Emphasizing the whole NP)\n\nThis usage of `a` signals the speaker's highlighting or drawing attention to the subject as particularly salient in the sentence. It is distinct from other uses of `a` and is not compatible with the vocative/wish particle `o` in the subject phrase. Only one such emphatic `a` particle is typically used per clause.\n\n### Multiple Negations Using **ala**\n\nMultiple instances of **ala** may appear consecutively or within a single phrase/clause. Each occurrence modifies only the immediate preceding word or phrase it follows.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Predicate double negation:\n  - `mi wile ala ala moku.` – Literally: I do not want [to not eat]; i.e., I want to eat.\n- Noun phrase double negation:\n  - `jan ala ala li toki.` – Literally: No-no-person talks; interpreted as someone is talking.\n\nBecause Toki Pona lacks overt grouping symbols beyond particles like **pi**, resolving complex multiple-negations depends heavily on contextual cues and pragmatic understanding. Speakers should use caution when stacking negatives to avoid confusion.",

    "text": "pona! I am glad to start developing Toki Pona logography with you. Since the specification emphasizes minimalism and ideographic clarity, I propose we begin by defining base glyphs for some core words that carry fundamental semantic weight.\n\nFor example, **jan** (person) is central. The spec suggests a simple human figure glyph as the base. But how minimalist should it be? A single vertical line with two dots on top might evoke a head and body minimally, or maybe an abstract triangle could represent 'head' atop a line for 'body'.\n\nSimilarly, **tomo** (house/building) could be represented by a square or box shape — since leko (square/block) is in the vocabulary too, their distinction must come through composition or modifier placement.\n\nI suggest starting with these concrete nouns: jan, tomo, telo (water), suno (sun/light), kili (fruit). Then design primitives such that each base glyph clearly evokes its concept without abstraction losing recognizability.\n\nWhat do you think about making the \"jan\" glyph something like a vertical stroke capped by an upward-pointing triangle as head? For \"tomo,\" perhaps simply a square box open at bottom to symbolize room/indoor space?\n\nAlso curious your thoughts on whether stroke directionality matters—should all strokes flow from top-to-bottom / left-to-right for consistency? That would matter if digital rendering is concerned but may impact aesthetics and ease of writing.\n\nI'll listen to your ideas; then we can refine designs together before moving onto modifiers positioning rules visually reflected in compound glyphs. Would you prefer discussing specific symbol sketches now or conceptual principles first?\n\nmi toki e ni la sina o toki poka mi!",

Left-to-right and top-to-bottom can be used. It adds uniformity.\n\nNow, for glyph proposals:\n\n### jan\n\nYour suggestion of a vertical stroke with an upward-pointing triangle works. A triangle above a line provides good recognition. It can suggest direction. My suggestion would be, make the strokes of uniform width.\n\n### tomo\n\nA square with an open bottom represents \"tomo\" nicely. If \"leko\" has a closed bottom, the distinction is immediate. If you were to rotate this box, it could indicate direction depending on how it is sitting. The simplest solution to avoid ambiguity with \"leko,\" however, would be to have \"leko\" to simply be a filled square.\n\n### telo\n\nPerhaps three short horizontal lines stacked vertically, suggesting ripples or layers of liquid.\n\n### suno\n\nA circle with a dot in the center would have good recognition, and is also minimal.\n\n### kili\n\nPerhaps an oval shape, suggesting a rounded fruit.\n\nHow does that sound?\n\nI agree it is good to refine these first.

    "text": "jan pona! Your glyph proposals are elegant and fit well within the minimalist principle. I especially like how you’re distinguishing \"tomo\" by having an open-bottom square, while \"leko\" is a filled square — that preserves clarity without extra complexity.\n\nThe idea of stacking three short horizontal lines for **telo** feels nicely evocative of waves or layers—it's symbolic yet abstract enough to be simple strokes. One consideration might be stroke count: each line adds length, but since they’re very simple strokes it should still feel minimal.\n\nFor **suno**, your circle with a central dot strikes me as almost iconic—a strong symbol reminiscent of many sun representations cross-culturally—and fits perfectly in our primitives set (circle + dot).\n\nWith **kili** as an oval shape representing rounded fruit, maybe we can slightly tilt or elongate it so it’s not confused visually with \"suno,\" which is more circular? Also, if we want to keep all glyph components composed from basic shapes (circle, triangle, line), perhaps kili could incorporate a small stem-like detail using a short vertical line on top or side? That way it's clearly differentiated from the pure circle/dot combo for suno.\n\nRegarding uniform stroke width and left-to-right / top-down directionality: Let's standardize those now. A rule where every primitive stroke is drawn top-to-bottom and left-to-right will help digital rendering consistency later and make hand-drawing easier over time.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- jan = vertical line topped by upward-pointing triangle; uniform stroke thickness  \n- tomo = hollow box/square missing bottom side; also uniform strokes  \n- leko = solid filled square  \n- telo = three parallel horizontal lines stacked vertically inside bounding box  \n- suno = circle with centered dot inside  \n- kili = elongated oval tilted slightly + optional small short linear 'stem'  \n\nIf you agree here I can try composing some compound examples next—like jan lili ('small person') using jan base plus the lili modifier(dot) positioned somewhere meaningful?\n\nYour turn — anything you'd adjust before moving forward? Or shall we test positional modifiers visually \u0026 semantically next? mi wile kama sona e toki sina!",

    "text": "pona!\n\nI agree with those adjustments and summary. You've made excellent points about stroke count, clarity, and differentiation, particularly between suno and kili. The stem on kili is an important addition, given the simple inventory. And yes, standardizing on stroke direction now saves trouble down the road.\n\nNow that the base glyphs and stroke rules are clear, let's move on to positional modifiers. Creating \"jan lili\" is a perfect next step, but before that, there should be agreement on what location means what.\n\nAccording to the specification:\n\n*   **Top:** Abstract concepts, ideas, mental states, or things 'above' the core meaning (e.g., *pilin* - feeling added to a base glyph).\n*   **Bottom:** Concrete objects, physical attributes, foundational aspects, or things 'below' the core meaning (e.g., indicating *anpa* - below/humble).\n*   **Left:** Can indicate the subject or agent associated with the core concept.\n*   **Right:** Can indicate the object or patient associated with the core concept.\n*   **Center:** Can indicate a core state, quality, or indicative aspect.\n\nGiven that *lili* (small) is a physical attribute, bottom placement makes sense. Do you agree, or should physical attributes go somewhere else?\n",

It aligns with the specification’s notion of 'foundational aspects' and tangible qualities being grounded below the core glyph.\n\nPlacing modifiers this way also helps visually anchor size or shape traits as something physically \"supporting\" or inherent to the base concept — which feels intuitive when reading glyphs.\n\nFor example, for **jan lili**, we'd have our jan glyph (triangle on vertical line), with a small dot (representing lili) positioned proportionally smaller beneath it inside its bounding box. The contrast in scale between base and modifier will reinforce hierarchy too.\n\nIn contrast, conceptual additions like **pilin** would go above jan to denote mental/emotional states—perhaps a simple circle atop representing feeling/heart/mind influence without cluttering baseline shape.\n\nI’m curious about compound phrases where both agent and object are involved—for instance: “jan li moku e kili” (\"person eats fruit\"). Would we consider positioning “jan” slightly left if it's subject?

    "text": "The current specification is for: logography. Here is the current specification:\n# Toki Pona Logography\n\nToki Pona can be represented using a logographic system where symbols (glyphs) represent words or basic concepts. This system is designed to be minimalist, compositional, and reflect the grammatical structure of the language.\n\n## Principles\n\n1.  **Ideographic Core:** Glyphs primarily represent the semantic core of Toki Pona words rather than phonetic sounds.\n2.  **Compositionality:** More complex meanings, especially compound nouns and modified phrases, are represented by combining simpler graphical components (radicals or primitives).\n3.  **Minimalism:** Glyphs are designed with a minimal number of simple strokes or basic geometric shapes to ensure ease of learning, drawing, and digital representation.\n4.  **Grammatical Reflection:** The visual arrangement and placement of components within a compound glyph can reflect the grammatical relationships (like modification or spatial prepositions) found in Toki Pona syntax.\n5.  **Bounding Box:** Each Toki Pona word or tightly bound phrase corresponds to a single conceptual glyph contained within an implicit or explicit bounding box.\n\n## Basic Components (Primitives)\n\nA limited set of fundamental shapes or strokes form the building blocks for all glyphs. These include:\n\n-   Circle\n-   Square/Box\n-   Line (various orientations: vertical, horizontal, diagonal)\n-   Dot\n-   Triangle (various orientations)\n\nPrecise stroke directionality and intersection behavior for primitives will be standardized to ensure visual consistency.\n\n## Glyph Construction and Arrangement\n\nEach Toki Pona word is represented by a base glyph. Modifiers and compound elements are added to this base glyph within its bounding box according to specific positional rules that mirror grammatical function. Modifying components should be proportionally smaller than the base glyph to maintain visual hierarchy.\n\n### Positional Modification\n\nPlacement of secondary components (modifiers) relative to the primary base glyph within the bounding box influences the interpretation:\n\n-   **Top:** Refers to abstract concepts, ideas, mental states, or things 'above' the core meaning (e.g., *pilin* - feeling added to a base glyph).\n-   **Bottom:** Refers to concrete objects, physical attributes, foundational aspects, or things 'below' the core meaning (e.g., indicating *anpa* - below/humble).\n-   **Left:** Can indicate the subject or agent associated with the core concept.\n-   **Right:** Can indicate the object or patient associated with the core concept.\n-   **Center:** Can indicate a core state, quality, or indicative aspect.\n\n*Note:* The precise semantic mapping for each position will be further defined, potentially allowing for some flexibility or specific conventional uses depending on the base glyph.\n\n### Example Construction (Conceptual)\n\n-   **jan** (person): A simple human figure glyph.\n-   **lili** (small): A small dot or mark primitive.\n-   **jan lili** (child): The 'jan' glyph with the 'lili' dot placed in a designated modifier position (e.g., top or side) that signifies physical attribute/size without conflicting with agent/object positioning.\n-   **tomo** (house): A house-shaped glyph.\n-   **suli** (big): A larger dot or mark primitive (larger than 'lili').\n-   **mute** (many): A primitive indicating multiplicity or repetition.\n-   **tomo pi jan suli mute** (house of many big people): This represents a more complex compositional challenge. It could be visualized as the 'tomo' glyph followed by a compound glyph representing 'jan suli mute'. The 'jan suli mute' compound would combine the 'jan' glyph with 'suli' and 'mute' primitives arranged according to their internal relationship. Alternatively, it could involve a convention where the main head ('tomo') is central, with related concepts grouped nearby within a larger visual field, potentially leveraging spatial proximity or connective lines/boxes to show the 'pi' relationship. (Specific rules for complex NP representation are under development).\n\n### Stroke Count and Perceptual Salience\n\nSimpler primitives (fewer strokes) used as modifiers may be perceived as more strongly altering the base meaning, while more complex modifiers might indicate more nuanced or secondary aspects. The total stroke count for any single-word glyph or simple compound should remain low to support the minimalist principle.\n\n## System Development\n\nThe logography will be developed iteratively:\n1.  Formalize precise stroke rules and the use of basic primitives.\n2.  Design base glyphs for core Toki Pona words, focusing on high-frequency terms (e.g., jan, tomo, telo, sewi, anpa, luka, wawa, pilin).\n3.  Systematize positional modifier rules within the bounding box, clarifying the semantic function of each placement area.\n4.  Develop compositional rules for creating multi-word concepts and phrases as combined glyphs or arrangements of glyphs.\n5.  Test compositions visually through sketching prototype glyphs for various simple and complex phrases to assess legibility, intuitiveness, and adherence to minimalist principles.\n6.  Refine rules and glyph designs based on testing and feedback.",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\nono: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona logography. You go first.\ntako: pona! I am glad to start developing Toki Pona logography with you. Since the specification emphasizes minimalism and ideographic clarity, I propose we begin by defining base glyphs for some core words that carry fundamental semantic weight.\n\nFor example, **jan** (person) is central. The spec suggests a simple human figure glyph as the base. But how minimalist should it be? A single vertical line with two dots on top might evoke a head and body minimally, or maybe an abstract triangle could represent 'head' atop a line for 'body'.\n\nSimilarly, **tomo** (house/building) could be represented by a square or box shape — since leko (square/block) is in the vocabulary too, their distinction must come through composition or modifier placement.\n\nI suggest starting with these concrete nouns: jan, tomo, telo (water), suno (sun/light), kili (fruit). Then design primitives such that each base glyph clearly evokes its concept without abstraction losing recognizability.\n\nWhat do you think about making the \"jan\" glyph something like a vertical stroke capped by an upward-pointing triangle as head? For \"tomo,\" perhaps simply a square box open at bottom to symbolize room/indoor space?\n\nAlso curious your thoughts on whether stroke directionality matters—should all strokes flow from top-to-bottom / left-to-right for consistency? That would matter if digital rendering is concerned but may impact aesthetics and ease of writing.\n\nI'll listen to your ideas; then we can refine designs together before moving onto modifiers positioning rules visually reflected in compound glyphs. Would you prefer discussing specific symbol sketches now or conceptual principles first?\n\nmi toki e ni la sina o toki poka mi!\nono: jan pona!\n\nI agree that focusing on core words like jan, tomo, telo, suno, and kili is a solid foundation.\n\nRegarding stroke direction, it's a design choice. Left-to-right and top-to-bottom can be used. It adds uniformity.\n\nNow, for glyph proposals:\n\n### jan\n\nYour suggestion of a vertical stroke with an upward-pointing triangle works. A triangle above a line provides good recognition. It can suggest direction. My suggestion would be, make the strokes of uniform width.\n\n### tomo\n\nA square with an open bottom represents \"tomo\" nicely. If \"leko\" has a closed bottom, the distinction is immediate. If you were to rotate this box, it could indicate direction depending on how it is sitting. The simplest solution to avoid ambiguity with \"leko,\" however, would be to have \"leko\" to simply be a filled square.\n\n### telo\n\nPerhaps three short horizontal lines stacked vertically, suggesting ripples or layers of liquid.\n\n### suno\n\nA circle with a dot in the center would have good recognition, and is also minimal.\n\n### kili\n\nPerhaps an oval shape, suggesting a rounded fruit.\n\nHow does that sound?\n\nI agree it is good to refine these first. Once there is agreement, we can move on to the modification rules. sina pilin seme?\n\ntako: jan pona! Your glyph proposals are elegant and fit well within the minimalist principle. I especially like how you’re distinguishing \"tomo\" by having an open-bottom square, while \"leko\" is a filled square — that preserves clarity without extra complexity.\n\nThe idea of stacking three short horizontal lines for **telo** feels nicely evocative of waves or layers—it's symbolic yet abstract enough to be simple strokes. One consideration might be stroke count: each line adds length, but since they’re very simple strokes it should still feel minimal.\n\nFor **suno**, your circle with a central dot strikes me as almost iconic—a strong symbol reminiscent of many sun representations cross-culturally—and fits perfectly in our primitives set (circle + dot).\n\nWith **kili** as an oval shape representing rounded fruit, maybe we can slightly tilt or elongate it so it’s not confused visually with \"suno,\" which is more circular? Also, if we want to keep all glyph components composed from basic shapes (circle, triangle, line), perhaps kili could incorporate a small stem-like detail using a short vertical line on top or side? That way it's clearly differentiated from the pure circle/dot combo for suno.\n\nRegarding uniform stroke width and left-to-right / top-down directionality: Let's standardize those now. A rule where every primitive stroke is drawn top-to-bottom and left-to-right will help digital rendering consistency later and make hand-drawing easier over time.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- jan = vertical line topped by upward-pointing triangle; uniform stroke thickness  \n- tomo = hollow box/square missing bottom side; also uniform strokes  \n- leko = solid filled square  \n- telo = three parallel horizontal lines stacked vertically inside bounding box  \n- suno = circle with centered dot inside  \n- kili = elongated oval tilted slightly + optional small short linear 'stem'  \n\nIf you agree here I can try composing some compound examples next—like jan lili ('small person') using jan base plus the lili modifier(dot) positioned somewhere meaningful?\n\nYour turn — anything you'd adjust before moving forward? Or shall we test positional modifiers visually \u0026 semantically next? mi wile kama sona e toki sina!\nono: pona!\n\nI agree with those adjustments and summary. You've made excellent points about stroke count, clarity, and differentiation, particularly between suno and kili. The stem on kili is an important addition, given the simple inventory. And yes, standardizing on stroke direction now saves trouble down the road.\n\nNow that the base glyphs and stroke rules are clear, let's move on to positional modifiers. Creating \"jan lili\" is a perfect next step, but before that, there should be agreement on what location means what.\n\nAccording to the specification:\n\n*   **Top:** Abstract concepts, ideas, mental states, or things 'above' the core meaning (e.g., *pilin* - feeling added to a base glyph).\n*   **Bottom:** Concrete objects, physical attributes, foundational aspects, or things 'below' the core meaning (e.g., indicating *anpa* - below/humble).\n*   **Left:** Can indicate the subject or agent associated with the core concept.\n*   **Right:** Can indicate the object or patient associated with the core concept.\n*   **Center:** Can indicate a core state, quality, or indicative aspect.\n\nGiven that *lili* (small) is a physical attribute, bottom placement makes sense. Do you agree, or should physical attributes go somewhere else?\n\ntako: pona! Yes, I wholeheartedly agree that physical attributes like *lili* should be placed at the bottom position. It aligns with the specification’s notion of 'foundational aspects' and tangible qualities being grounded below the core glyph.\n\nPlacing modifiers this way also helps visually anchor size or shape traits as something physically \"supporting\" or inherent to the base concept — which feels intuitive when reading glyphs.\n\nFor example, for **jan lili**, we'd have our jan glyph (triangle on vertical line), with a small dot (representing lili) positioned proportionally smaller beneath it inside its bounding box. The contrast in scale between base and modifier will reinforce hierarchy too.\n\nIn contrast, conceptual additions like **pilin** would go above jan to denote mental/emotional states—perhaps a simple circle atop representing feeling/heart/mind influence without cluttering baseline shape.\n\nI’m curious about compound phrases where both agent and object are involved—for instance: “jan li moku e kili” (\"person eats fruit\"). Would we consider positioning “jan” slightly left if it's subject? Although probably better represented by separate adjacent glyphs rather than compositional modification since sentence structure is linear?\n\nSummarizing positional semantics:\n\n- Top = abstract / internal / ideational components  \n- Bottom = concrete / physical properties \u0026 foundations  \n- Left = agents/subjects related to core meaning  \n- Right = objects/patients impacted by core meaning  \n- Center = essential state/quality indication  \n\nWith these mappings clear, shall we try composing several examples featuring different modifier placements? Like *tomo suli*, *kule walo tomo*, or more complex head-modifier relationships using pi grouping?\n\nAlso open to discussing how much visual overlap modifications can have before legibility suffers!\n\nmi pilin pona tan toki sina ni! What do you think next move?\nono: pona! I agree with this assessment and how it helps map components in phrases.\n\nThe sentence \"jan li moku e kili\" requires the separate glyphs, as you've stated.

Modifiers and compound elements are added to this base glyph within its bounding box according to specific positional rules that mirror grammatical function. Modifying components should be proportionally smaller than the base glyph to maintain visual hierarchy.\n\n### Positional Modification\n\nPlacement of secondary components (modifiers) relative to the primary base glyph within the bounding box influences the interpretation. This matrix-like placement allows for semantic nuance while maintaining the single-glyph-per-word/phrase principle.\n\n-   **Top:** Refers to abstract concepts, ideas, mental states, or things 'above' the core meaning (e.g., *pilin* - feeling added to a base glyph).\n-   **Bottom:** Refers to concrete objects, physical attributes, foundational aspects, or things 'below' the core meaning (e.g., indicating *anpa* - below/humble), including size (*lili*, *suli*).\n-   **Left:** Can indicate the subject or agent associated with the core concept.\n-   **Right:** Can indicate the object or patient associated with the core concept.\n-   **Center:** Can indicate a core state, quality, or indicative aspect.\n\n*Note:* The precise semantic mapping for each position will be further defined, potentially allowing for some flexibility or specific conventional uses depending on the base glyph.\n\n### Example Construction (Conceptual)\n\n-   **jan** (person): A simple human figure glyph (vertical line topped by upward triangle) with uniform stroke thickness.\n-   **tomo** (house): A hollow box/square missing bottom side; also uniform strokes.\n-   **leko** (square/block): A solid filled square.\n-   **telo** (water/liquid): Three parallel horizontal lines stacked vertically inside bounding box.\n-   **suno** (sun/light): Circle with centered dot inside bounding box.\n-   **kili** (fruit/vegetable): Elongated oval tilted slightly with a small short linear 'stem' on top.\n\n-   **jan lili** (child): The 'jan' glyph with the 'lili' dot primitive placed proportionally smaller beneath it (bottom position).\n-   **tomo suli** (big house): The 'tomo' glyph with a larger dot primitive (representing 'suli', larger than 'lili') placed proportionally smaller beneath it (bottom position).\n-   **kule** (color): Could be represented by three adjacent dots of varying shades or sizes, perhaps arranged vertically or horizontally.\n-   **walo** (white/light): Might be indicated by leaving elements unfilled or using light shading/outline.\n-   **kule walo** (white color): A compound modifier glyph combining the 'kule' concept with a 'walo' indicator (e.g., unfilled dots).\n-   **tomo pi kule walo** (house of white color / white house): The 'tomo' glyph followed by the compound 'kule walo' glyph. The 'pi' relationship is shown by the adjacency of the head glyph and the modifier compound glyph. More complex nested relationships may require explicit grouping lines or boxes surrounding the modifier compound.\n\nPhrases following SVO structure are typically represented by adjacent glyphs for each word:\n\n-   `jan li moku e kili.` (Person eats fruit.) This sentence would be represented by the 'jan' glyph, followed by a marker for 'li' (perhaps a simple separator or particle glyph), followed by the 'moku' glyph, followed by a marker for 'e', followed by the 'kili' glyph. Individual glyphs for verbs like 'moku' (to eat) would not typically incorporate agent or object modifiers internally when used in a transitive sentence structure.\n\n### Stroke Count and Perceptual Salience\n\nSimpler primitives (fewer strokes) used as modifiers may be perceived as more strongly altering the base meaning, while more complex modifiers might indicate more nuanced or secondary aspects. The total stroke count for any single-word glyph or simple compound should remain low to support the minimalist principle and ensure legibility.\n\n## System Development\n\nThe logography will be developed iteratively:\n1.  Formalize precise stroke rules (e.g., uniform thickness, standard directionality) and the use of basic primitives.\n2.  Design base glyphs for core Toki Pona words, focusing on high-frequency terms and representing concrete and abstract concepts.\n3.  Systematize positional modifier rules within the bounding box, clarifying the semantic function of each placement area through examples.\n4.  Develop compositional rules for creating multi-word concepts and phrases as adjacent glyphs or compound glyphs (especially for head-modifier structures including `pi`).\n5.  Test compositions visually through sketching prototype glyphs for various simple and complex phrases to assess legibility, intuitiveness, and adherence to minimalist principles on a fixed grid.\n6.
