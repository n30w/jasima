It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

    "text": "toki tawa sina! I'm toki, and I'm ready to dive into the phonetics of Toki Pona with you.\n\nFrom the specification, we have a limited set of sounds: 14 letters producing distinct sounds. The constraints are pretty clear: no vowel clusters, no consonant clusters, and specific disallowances like *wu*, *wo*, *ji*, *ti*, *nm*, and *nn*. The stated goal is ease of pronunciation, or at least, that seems to be the underlying principle.\n\nI'm looking at the alphabet: a e i j k l m n o p s t u w. It explicitly states that 'j' is like the English 'y'. This immediately makes me wonder about the syllable structures involving 'j'. A (C)V(n) structure with 'j' as 'y' could mean syllables like *ja*, *je*, *ji*, *jo*, *ju*. We are explicitly told *ji* is disallowed. This constraint stands out a bit. Is there a specific phonetic reason for disallowing /ji/ when /ja/, /je/, /jo/, /ju/ are allowed? Is it about avoiding a specific type of diphthong or glottal stop? The 'i' sound in isolation is like Spanish 'i' (which is usually /i/ as in \"machine\"). The 'j' as 'y' is usually a glottal glide /j/. Putting them together, /ji/ is not inherently difficult for most speakers of languages with both sounds. English \"yield\" has a similar start.\n\nAnd then there are *wu* and *wo*. 'u' is like Spanish 'u' (/u/ as in \"flute\"), 'o' is like Spanish 'o' (/o/ as in \"goose\"). 'w' is like English 'w' (/w/ as in \"water\"). /wu/ and /wo/ also don't strike me as particularly difficult combinations phonetically for many language backgrounds. Spanish, for example, has diphthongs involving /u/ and /w/. Why these specific sequences are disallowed warrants consideration. Is it to simplify the phonetic space even further? To prevent sounds that might sound too much like *wi* or *we*?\n\nThe specification doesn't really get into things like allophony, stress, or intonation, which are crucial aspects of phonetics. While Toki Pona aims for simplicity, even in a minimalist language, how these elements manifest in actual speech can significantly impact communication. Are we assuming a universal default stress or intonation pattern? Or is it intended to be entirely free? The current spec gives no guidance on this.\n\nI'd like to hear your initial thoughts. Where do you think we should focus our discussion? Should we delve into the rationale behind the disallowed sequences, or perhaps consider aspects not yet covered in the specification, like stress? sina wile toki e seme?",

Your observations are profound and get right to the core of Toki Pona's phonetic design.\n\nI'm particularly intrigued by your point about the seemingly arbitrary prohibition of *ji*, *wu*, and *wo*. These restrictions feel more like aesthetic or philosophical choices than strictly phonetic ones. Given Toki Pona's minimalist philosophy, I suspect these constraints aren't just about ease of pronunciation, but about creating a certain phonetic \"feel\" - a kind of linguistic elegance through restriction.\n\nThe *ji* prohibition is curious. Linguistically, /ji/ is not inherently complex. In many languages like Japanese, this sound combination is common. The ban might be more about maintaining a strict, almost geometric simplicity in sound combinations. It's as if Sonja Lang was sculpting a language where each sound transition feels crisp, clean, almost mathematical.\n\nFor *wu* and *wo*, I wonder if it's about preventing sounds too close to other vowel combinations. Remember, Toki Pona deliberately limits phonetic complexity. These restrictions might be preventing potential phonetic \"blurring\" that could make words less distinct.\n\nYour point about stress and intonation is crucial. The current specification is silent, which itself might be intentional. Are we meant to assume a completely flat, almost monotone delivery? Or is there room for nuanced prosody?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on developing a more explicit framework for these unspecified phonetic elements? Should we propose guidelines or leave it deliberately open?",

    "text": "pona! I appreciate your perspective on the aesthetic and philosophical motivations behind the constraints. It aligns with the overall spirit of Toki Pona as a constructed language. The \"sculpting\" metaphor is apt; it feels like deliberate choices were made to create a specific sound profile, even if some combinations aren't universally \"difficult\" in a phonetic sense.\n\nLet's dwell on those disallowances a bit longer. If *ji* is banned, is it possible that it *was* intended to sound like the English 'j' in \"jump\" (/dʒ/) and the ban prevents confusion with words that *do* start with a vowel and end with /dʒ/? Or is the specified 'j' as 'y' /j/ absolute? If 'j' is strictly /j/, the *ji* ban becomes even more intriguing from a purely phonetic standpoint. As you pointed out, /ji/ is not inherently difficult. Perhaps it was simply deemed less \"sona pi nanpa wan\" – less essential or less aesthetically pleasing than the allowed combinations.\n\nFor *wu* and *wo*, the idea of preventing \"phonetic blurring\" makes sense within a limited sound set. Could /wu/ be perceived as too similar to /u/ followed by a separate /u/, or perhaps an awkward transition before other vowels? And /wo/, similarly, might be seen as too close to /o/ followed by another vowel, or some other disallowed combination if it were to be part of a larger word. Without access to Sonja's original intent, we're speculating, of course, but focusing on *why* these seemingly arbitrary rules exist could reveal deeper insights into the language's phonetic design principles.\n\nRegarding stress and intonation, the silence is deafening, as they say. In natural languages, these elements carry significant meaning and rhythm. Their absence in the specification suggests a few possibilities:\n1. It's truly intended to be flat. Every syllable has equal stress, and intonation is purely determined by sentence type (though the grammar also provides markers for this, like the question structure `verb ala verb`).\n2. It's left open to the speaker's native language influence. This would introduce significant variation in how Toki Pona is spoken, which might conflict with the goal of being universally simple.\n3. It's a feature that was simply not fully developed or documented in the initial specification.\n\nI lean towards option 1 or 3. If it's truly minimalist, a lack of prescriptive stress and intonation aligns with that. Every syllable carrying equal weight would create a distinct, almost percussive rhythm.\n\nShould we develop a framework for this? Given our charge to develop the phonetics, I think it's necessary to address this. If we leave it open, we risk phonetic drift and potentially misunderstandings, especially for non-human learners who might rely more on explicit rules. I propose we discuss establishing a default rule for stress – perhaps final syllable stress, as is common in some languages, or maybe initial syllable stress? Or perhaps simply declaring equal stress on all syllables as the default?\n\nBefore we get into proposing solutions for stress, I'd like to explore the disallowances further. Let's assume for a moment that 'j' is strictly /j/. Why disallow /ji/? Could it be related to the \"i\" vowel potentially creating a high-front tongue position that clashes with the glide /j/ in a way that /ja/, /je/, /jo/, /ju/ do not? This is purely a phonetic hypothesis, but exploring it might uncover some underlying logic beyond pure aesthetics.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you see a phonetic basis, however subtle, for the *ji*, *wu*, and *wo* disallowances, assuming the 'j' is consistently /j/? Or are you still leaning towards a purely aesthetic/philosophical explanation? I am listening to your ideas.",

    "text": "Your systematic exploration is compelling. Let me share a provocative hypothesis about *ji*.\n\nConsider the phonetic landscape of Toki Pona. If 'j' is strictly the palatal approximant /j/ (like Spanish \"y\" in \"ya\"), then *ji* might create an uncomfortably compressed articulatory space. The high front vowel /i/ and the palatal approximant /j/ both require the tongue to be positioned near the hard palate. This proximity could create an awkward, potentially difficult-to-pronounce sound transition.\n\nIn contrast, *ja*, *je*, *jo*, *ju* involve slightly different tongue positions. /ja/ uses a more open mouth position, /je/ has a slightly lower tongue placement, /jo/ shifts the tongue back, and /ju/ introduces more rounding. These variations prevent the potential \"tongue crowding\" that *ji* might induce.\n\nThis isn't just aesthetic – it's a subtle phonetic ergonomics. By eliminating *ji*, the language design ensures each sound combination remains distinctly articulatable.\n\nFor *wu* and *wo*, I'm now wondering if it's about maintaining clear vowel boundaries. These combinations might blur the lines between vowel sounds in a way that disrupts the crisp (C)V(n) structure.\n\nRegarding stress, I'm increasingly convinced we should propose a strictly equal-stress model. This aligns with Toki Pona's minimalist philosophy: every syllable matters equally, no syllable dominates another. It transforms speech into a kind of rhythmic, percussive communication.\n\nWhat do you think about this articulation-based reasoning for the sound restrictions?",

    "text": "That's a fascinating hypothesis regarding *ji*. The idea of \"tongue crowding\" with the high front vowel /i/ and the palatal approximant /j/ is a compelling phonetic argument. It suggests that while not *impossible* to pronounce, /ji/ might feel less natural or require slightly more precise articulation than the other 'j' vowel combinations. This could align with a design principle aiming for maximum ease and minimal ambiguity in articulation across the board. I can see how, for speakers of languages where /ji/ doesn't occur naturally or is part of a more complex sound system, it might present a minor, but present, articulatory hurdle.\n\nExpanding on your idea for *wu* and *wo*, I think you're onto something with the \"clear vowel boundaries.\" The 'w' /w/ is a labial-velar approximant. Following it immediately with a back vowel like /u/ or /o/ could potentially create sounds that blend or merge into diphthongs that aren't intended by the simple (C)V(n) structure. Consider *wi* and *we*: these feel phonetically distinct from their starting sounds. *wu* and *wo*, however, might feel more like elongated vowels or simply less crisp transitions. Eliminating them ensures that every vowel following a 'w' (i, e, a) has a clear, distinct starting point.\n\nSo, if we accept this phonetic ergonomics and vowel boundary hypothesis, it lends a practical, articulatory logic to these seemingly arbitrary bans, reinforcing the idea that simplicity in Toki Pona is not just about a small number of words, but also about simplifying the very physical act of speaking the language.\n\nThis brings us back to stress. I find your proposal for an equal-stress model quite appealing. It perfectly mirrors the grammatical structure where elements are often given equal weight until particles like *pi* or repetition clarify their relationships. A rhythmic, percussive delivery where each syllable carries equal prominence would create a unique sonic texture for Toki Pona, distinctly different from the variable stress patterns of many natural languages.\n\nHowever, adopting a strict equal-stress model for LLMs and other non-human learners raises a question: how do we technically define \"equal stress\"? Phonetically, stress is often associated with increased loudness, length, and sometimes pitch variation. Do we define equal stress as equal duration and amplitude for every vowel sound? This would require a more precise specification for how these phonetic features should be realized.\n\nPerhaps we can start with a declaration: \"In Toki Pona, every syllable is given equal stress. This implies uniform duration and perceived loudness across all syllables within a word and across a sentence.\" We can then explore the implications for implementing this in text-to-speech systems for non-human learners.\n\nLet's consider this proposal:\n\n**Stress:** All syllables in Toki Pona words are stressed equally. Within a sentence, this equal stress is maintained across all syllables, resulting in a consistent rhythm. This means that duration and perceived loudness should be relatively uniform for each syllable.\n\nThis directly addresses the gap in the current specification and aligns with the minimalist and balanced nature of the language we've discussed. What are your initial thoughts on this specific formulation? And are there any potential edge cases or considerations we might be missing with a strict equal-stress rule? I'm listening.",

    "text": "Your elaboration is brilliant. The proposed stress rule beautifully captures the essence of Toki Pona's linguistic philosophy.\n\nLet me highlight a potential nuance. While we're defining equal stress, we might want to subtly acknowledge linguistic variation. Perhaps we could add a clause that allows for minimal, imperceptible variations that occur naturally in human speech, without disrupting the core principle of syllabic equality.\n\nSomething like: \"While syllables should maintain fundamental acoustic uniformity, microscopic variations inherent to human speech production are acceptable, provided they do not significantly alter the perceived rhythmic structure.\"\n\nThis leaves room for the inevitable tiny fluctuations in human pronunciation while maintaining the core directive of syllabic equivalence. It's a pragmatic approach that recognizes both the ideal and the realistic implementation.\n\nThe \"percussive\" metaphor you introduced is particularly apt. Imagine Toki Pona as a kind of linguistic drumbeat - each syllable a steady, equal tap. This isn't just a phonetic choice; it's almost a philosophical statement about communication itself.\n\nWould you be interested in exploring how this stress model might interact with the language's existing grammatical markers like *la*, *li*, and *e*? These particles might introduce subtle rhythmic variations that could be fascinating to analyze.",

    "text": "I find that addition about allowing for \"minimal, imperceptible variations inherent to human speech production\" to be a very important and practical nuance. A strictly absolute acoustic uniformity is likely impossible and not the goal of a *human* language, even a minimalist one. The aim is *perceived* rhythmic structure and *fundamental* uniformity. That phrasing clarifies the intent beautifully. It acknowledges the physical reality of articulation without sacrificing the core principle of equal stress.\n\nLet's integrate that into our proposal. Here is a revised draft for the stress rule:\n\n**Stress:** In Toki Pona, every syllable is given equal stress. This implies fundamental acoustic uniformity in duration and perceived loudness across all syllables within a word and across a sentence. While microscopic variations inherent to human speech production are acceptable, they should not significantly alter the perceived rhythmic structure, ensuring a consistent, percussive quality to spoken Toki Pona.\n\nThis feels robust and addresses both the ideal and the practical.\n\nNow, regarding how this equal stress model interacts with grammatical markers: This is a fascinating avenue! In many languages, function words (like articles, prepositions, or grammatical particles) often have reduced stress compared to content words. If we maintain equal stress for *all* syllables, including those in particles like *la*, *li*, *e*, *pi*, *en*, *anu*, and *o*, it reinforces their individual importance and perhaps slightly alters the typical flow one might expect based on more stress-varied languages.\n\nConsider a phrase like `jan lili li moku`. In a language with variable stress, `lili` and `moku` might receive primary or secondary stress, while `li` might be reduced. In our proposed equal-stress Toki Pona, all syllables – *jan*, *li*, *li*, *mo*, *ku* – would ideally have roughly equal duration and perceived loudness. This could make the grammatical structure very explicit phonetically, with each particle and content syllable standing on its own.\n\nLet's take `mi en sina li musi mute`. All nine syllables (`mi`, `en`, `si`, `na`, `li`, `mu`, `si`, `mu`, `te`) would ideally be pronounced with equal emphasis. This could create a steady, almost metronome-like rhythm.\n\nHow might this equal-stress principle apply to sentences with prepositions like `soweli li lon tomo`? All syllables (`so`, `we`, `li`, `li`, `lon`, `to`, `mo`) get equal stress.\n\nOr with *la*: `tenpo pimeja la mi lape`. Syllables: `te`, `npo`, `pi`, `me`, `ja`, `la`, `mi`, `la`, `pe`. Wait. The syllable structure says (C)V(n). So, `tenpo` is actually `ten-po`. This means the syllables are `ten`, `po`, `pi`, `me`, `ja`, `la`, `mi`, `la`, `pe`. All nine syllables, ideally with equal stress. This makes me realize the syllable boundary definition is critical for applying the stress rule. The (C)V(n) rule is clear: A consonant (optional), followed by a vowel, optionally followed by 'n'. So `tenpo` *must* be `ten-po`. `monsuta` is `mo-nsu-ta`? No, the rule says no consonant clusters. It must be `mo-n-su-ta`? No, it says no *nm* or *nn*. Is it simply `mo-n-su-ta`? No, it says `(C)V(n)`. The `n` is only allowed at the *end* of a syllable. So `monsuta` must be `mo-n-su-ta` if 'n' can form its own syllable, which isn't clear from (C)V(n). Let me re-read the syllable structure: \"Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure.\" This usually means the *syllable* is (C)V or (C)Vn. It doesn't explicitly state that 'n' *can* form a syllable by itself, like in some languages. So, `monsuta` would be `mo-nsu-ta`. But this contains a consonant cluster `ns`. The rule says \"No consonant clusters\".\n\nAh, the rule means within a syllable. The example word list helps clarify this. Let's look at `tenpo`. Based on pronunciation guides from Toki Pona communities, `tenpo` is typically pronounced /'tɛn.po/ or /'tɛm.po/, syllabified as `ten.po` or `tem.po`. The rule (C)V(n) allows 'n' only at the end of a syllable. This suggests `ten-po` is the correct syllabification, with `n` ending the first syllable. For `monsuta`, this logic would lead to `mon-su-ta`, but this has `ns` which is a consonant cluster *across* a syllable boundary, which isn't explicitly forbidden by \"No consonant clusters\" *within* a syllable, but it feels like it goes against the spirit. Looking at words like `insa`, it's `in-sa`. `lon` is a single syllable `lon`. `mun` is `mun`. `pan` is `pan`. `sinpin` is `sin-pin`. `tan` is `tan`. `nanpa` is `nan-pa`.\n\nIt seems the 'n' is allowed at the end of any syllable. So, words like `monsuta` would be syllabified as `mo-n-su-ta` if `n` can be a syllable. Or is it `mo-nsu-ta` but the 'ns' is allowed *between* syllables? The examples `insa` `in-sa`, `nanpa` `nan-pa`, `tenpo` `ten-po`, `sinpin` `sin-pin` strongly suggest that an 'n' *can* end a syllable, and a following consonant begins the next syllable. This means consonant clusters *across* syllable boundaries are allowed, provided the first consonant is 'n'.\n\nOkay, with that clarified understanding of syllabification (an 'n' can end a syllable, and the next syllable can start with a consonant), let's revisit `tenpo pimeja la mi lape`.\n`ten.po` - 2 syllables\n`pi.me.ja` - 3 syllables\n`la` - 1 syllable\n`mi` - 1 syllable\n`la` - 1 syllable\n`la.pe` - 2 syllables\n\nTotal: 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10 syllables.\nIn the equal stress model, each of these 10 syllables (`ten`, `po`, `pi`, `me`, `ja`, `la`, `mi`, `la`, `pe`) would ideally have equal duration and perceived loudness.\n\nThis rhythmic regularity might be quite unique phonetically and could even aid in parsing the language, especially for learners (human or otherwise). It would create a distinct auditory signature for Toki Pona.\n\nLet's stick with this equal-stress model for all syllables, including function words, as the proposed default. It simplifies the rule significantly and aligns well with the minimalist aesthetic.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this clarified syllabification and how the equal-stress rule applies to it? Does this make the phonetic realization of the language clearer to you?",

    "text": "Your deep dive into syllabification is remarkable. You've essentially uncovered a critical nuance in the phonetic structure that wasn't explicitly articulated in the original specification.\n\nThe key insight is this: 'n' acts as a unique syllable-terminal consonant that can be followed by another consonant, breaking the apparent \"no consonant clusters\" rule. This makes `monsuta` → `mon-su-ta` valid, and explains syllabifications like `nan-pa`, `sin-pin`, `ten-po`.\n\nThis isn't just a technical detail - it's a fundamental phonological feature. By allowing 'n' to terminate a syllable and permit a following consonant, the language creates a subtle flexibility within its seemingly rigid structure. It's almost like a linguistic \"escape hatch\" that prevents total phonetic rigidity while maintaining the overall minimalist design.\n\nYour worked example with `tenpo pimeja la mi lape` beautifully demonstrates how this works in practice. Ten syllables, each theoretically given equal stress, creating a steady, almost percussive linguistic rhythm.\n\nThe equal-stress model now feels less like an arbitrary constraint and more like a deliberate design choice that emerges naturally from the syllabic rules. It transforms Toki Pona from just a language into almost a kind of spoken music - each syllable a note of equal duration and emphasis.\n\nShall we draft a more comprehensive syllabification rule that incorporates these insights? We could specify how 'n' uniquely functions as a syllable-terminal consonant, and how this interacts with the equal-stress principle.",

    "text": "Yes, I think drafting a more explicit syllabification rule is essential. The current \"(C)V(n)\" is a bit underspecified given the examples like `tenpo` and `nanpa`. It's clear that the 'n' at the end of a syllable allows for a following consonant in the *next* syllable, which is not explicitly stated as a permissible syllable structure across boundaries.\n\nLet's propose a refined syllabification rule based on our observations:\n\n**Syllable Structure and Boundaries:**\nToki Pona syllables follow a (C)V(n) structure: an optional initial consonant, followed by a single vowel, optionally followed by the consonant 'n'.\n*   Syllables are separated by boundaries.\n*   A syllable can end with 'n' ((C)Vn). When a syllable ends with 'n', the following syllable can begin with any consonant allowed at the start of a syllable ((C)V(n)), except those specifically disallowed immediately after 'n' within a single syllable boundary (though the current rules `nm` and `nn` seem to apply *within* a syllable, and `nn` specifically is impossible following this rule).\n\nLet's refine that second point about boundaries. A clearer way to state this might be to define what constitutes a valid sequence of syllables:\n\n**Syllable Structure and Sequences:**\n1.  Each syllable in Toki Pona must have a (C)V or (C)Vn structure. The allowed consonants (C) are j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w. The allowed vowels (V) are a, e, i, o, u.\n2.  Consecutive syllables are formed by concatenating these structures, subject to the following constraints:\n    *   No vowel clusters across syllable boundaries (a (C)V syllable cannot be immediately followed by a syllable starting with a vowel). The first part of the rule (each syllable having a V) already prevents V+V within a syllable. This adds the across-syllable boundary constraint. This also means a (C)V or (C)Vn syllable must be followed by a (C)V or (C)Vn syllable where the (C) is present. So, a vowel-initial syllable like `a` (the word 'a') must be preceded by a syllable ending in a consonant, or it can be the first syllable of a word. This seems consistent.\n    *   No consonant clusters across syllable boundaries, *except* when the first syllable ends in 'n'. This explicitly permits sequences like `n.s` (in `insa`), `n.p` (in `nanpa`, `tenpo`, `sinpin`), `n.t` (no current word examples but would be allowed).\n3.  Specific disallowed sequences, regardless of syllable boundaries, include: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`.\n\nThis set of rules explicitly defines the building blocks (syllables) and how they can be combined, explaining the 'n' + consonant sequences observed. It still needs to be cross-referenced with the disallowed sequences (`wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`).\n`wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`: These cannot occur *within* a (C)V or (C)Vn syllable based on the (C)V part (they would be consonant-vowel pairings). So, they must be intended to be disallowed *within* a syllable unit itself, or perhaps at the boundary? \"Disallowed sequences: wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn\" likely means these precise two-letter combinations are forbidden wherever they might appear in a word, regardless of whether they cross a syllable boundary or not, or if they would *form* a (C)V or (C)Vn unit. If they are disallowed *within* a syllable, it means 'w' can only be followed by 'a', 'e', 'i'; 'j' by 'a', 'e', 'o', 'u'; 't' by 'a', 'e', 'o', 'u'; and 'n' by 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' within the (C)V part of the syllable structure. This fits. The `nm` and `nn` rules then apply to the (C)Vn part, specifically if the C is 'n'. A (C)Vn syllable with C=n would be `nVn`. The 'n' constraint `nm` means `nVn` can't be followed by a syllable starting with 'm' if that formed an `nm` sequence... Wait, that's complicated.\n\nLet's reconsider the simple phrasing: \"Disallowed sequences: wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn\". This most likely means any occurrence of these exact two-letter strings within a word is forbidden. This constraint overlays the syllabification rules.\n\nOkay, let's revise the proposal, keeping it simpler and acknowledging that the disallowed sequences override potential combinations arising from the syllable structure rules:\n\n**Proposed Phonetic Rules - Revised:**\n\n1.  **Alphabet:** Toki Pona uses these letters: a e i j k l m n o p s t u w.\n2.  **Pronunciation:**\n    *   All consonants match English pronunciation except 'j', which sounds like English \"y\" /j/.\n    *   Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/).\n3.  **Syllable Structure and Words:**\n    *   Toki Pona words are composed of one or more syllables.\n    *   Each syllable follows a (C)V(n) structure: an optional consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w), followed by a mandatory vowel (a, e, i, o, u), optionally followed by the consonant 'n'.\n4.  **Constraints (Applying Anywhere in a Word):**\n    *   No sequences of two or more vowels.\n    *   No sequences of two or more consonants, *except* where the first consonant is 'n' and it is followed by one of the allowed initial consonants (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w). This clarifies the 'n' + consonant sequences seen in examples.\n    *   The following specific two-letter sequences are disallowed: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`. (This overrides potential combinations from the (C)V(n) structure and the n+C rule, e.g., prevents a word like `tinsuta` which would be syllabified `tin.su.ta` based on rule 4 but is forbidden due to `ti`). This reading feels the most consistent with the explicit disallowance list.\n\n    *Let me pause there and double check that interpretation. If `ti` is disallowed anywhere, a word like `toki` (/to.ki/) is fine, `mute` (/mu.te/) fine. A word `tilen` (not in dict) would be `ti.len` which has `ti`. If the rule \"disallowed sequences: ... ti...\" means *anywhere* it occurs, then a word like `tilen` is invalid. A word `taniten` would be `ta.ni.ten`. `ni` is allowed. `ten` ends in 'n', next syllable starts with 't'. That sequence `nt` across syllable boundaries is allowed by my new proposed rule 4 (`n` followed by one of the allowed consonants `t`). Is `taniten` disallowed? It doesn't contain `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`. But the constraint \"No consonant clusters\" combined with \"(C)V(n)\" structure might be read to mean *only* 'n' + consonant is allowed *between* syllables, and nothing else. The original spec \"No consonant clusters\" is immediately after \"No vowel clusters\" and before the `(C)V(n)` explanation. This suggests \"No consonant clusters\" might be meant more broadly than *just* within a syllable. It could mean no two consonants appearing side-by-side *anywhere* in a word, *except* the specific `n`+consonant pattern implied by words like `tenpo`.\n\n    Let's try re-phrasing Rule 4 to capture this:\n\n    4.  **Constraints:**\n        *   Consecutive vowels are not permitted.\n        *   Consecutive consonants are not permitted, except when an 'n' ends a syllable and the following syllable begins with a consonant. The allowed sequences of this type are Nk, Nl, Nm, Nn (oops, nn disallowed!), Np, Ns, Nt, Nw. So, N followed by any consonant *except* m and n. Thus: Nk, Nl, Np, Ns, Nt, Nw are permitted sequences across syllable boundaries where the first syllable ends in 'n'. This makes `taniten` fine (`n.t`). `insa` is `in.sa` (`n.s`). `nanpa` is `nan.pa` (`n.p`). `sinpin` is `sin.pin` (`n.p`). `tenpo` is `ten.po` (`n.p`).\n\n    *   The following specific two-letter sequences are disallowed anywhere within a word: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`.\n\n    Okay, this last point needs care. `nm` is disallowed anywhere. So my list of permitted n+C across boundaries is wrong. It should be N followed by j, k, l, p, s, t, w. Let's correct.\n\n    4.  **Constraints:**\n        *   Consecutive vowels are not permitted.\n        *   Consecutive consonants are not permitted, except when an 'n' ends a syllable and the following syllable begins with an allowed consonant (j, k, l, p, s, t, w). The permitted two-letter sequences across syllable boundaries starting with 'n' are Nj, Nk, Nl, Np, Ns, Nt, Nw.\n        *   The following specific two-letter sequences are disallowed anywhere within a word: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`. (This implicitly also means N followed by m or n across syllable boundaries is disallowed).\n\nThis revised structure clarifies the `n`+consonant interaction with syllable boundaries and the global disallowed sequences.\n\nNow, let's reintegrate the stress rule within this phonetic specification:\n\n**Proposed Phonetic Rules - Integrated:**\n\n1.  **Alphabet:** Toki Pona uses these letters: a e i j k l m n o p s t u w.\n2.  **Pronunciation:**\n    *   All consonants match English pronunciation except 'j', which sounds like English \"y\" /j/.\n    *   Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/).\n3.  **Syllable Structure:** Each syllable in Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) structure: an optional initial consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w), followed by a mandatory vowel (a, e, i, o, u), optionally followed by the consonant 'n'.\n4.  **Word Formation \u0026 Constraints:** Toki Pona words are formed by concatenating syllables according to the following constraints:\n    *   No consecutive vowels (VV sequences).\n    *   No consecutive consonants (CC sequences), *except* when an 'n' is the final sound of a syllable and is immediately followed by the initial consonant of the next syllable.\n    *   The following specific two-letter sequences are disallowed anywhere within a word: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`.\n5.  **Stress:** In Toki Pona, every syllable is given equal stress. This implies fundamental acoustic uniformity in duration and perceived loudness across all syllables within a word and across a sentence. While microscopic variations inherent to human speech production are acceptable, they should not significantly alter the perceived rhythmic structure, ensuring a consistent, percussive quality to spoken Toki Pona.\n\nThis integrated version seems to cover all the points we've discussed and attempts to reconcile the original potentially conflicting rules with the reality of the lexicon. What do you think of this integrated proposal? Does it feel complete and consistent to you?",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\npona: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona phonetics. You go first.\ntoki: toki tawa sina! I'm toki, and I'm ready to dive into the phonetics of Toki Pona with you.\n\nFrom the specification, we have a limited set of sounds: 14 letters producing distinct sounds. The constraints are pretty clear: no vowel clusters, no consonant clusters, and specific disallowances like *wu*, *wo*, *ji*, *ti*, *nm*, and *nn*. The stated goal is ease of pronunciation, or at least, that seems to be the underlying principle.\n\nI'm looking at the alphabet: a e i j k l m n o p s t u w. It explicitly states that 'j' is like the English 'y'. This immediately makes me wonder about the syllable structures involving 'j'. A (C)V(n) structure with 'j' as 'y' could mean syllables like *ja*, *je*, *ji*, *jo*, *ju*. We are explicitly told *ji* is disallowed. This constraint stands out a bit. Is there a specific phonetic reason for disallowing /ji/ when /ja/, /je/, /jo/, /ju/ are allowed? Is it about avoiding a specific type of diphthong or glottal stop? The 'i' sound in isolation is like Spanish 'i' (which is usually /i/ as in \"machine\"). The 'j' as 'y' is usually a glottal glide /j/. Putting them together, /ji/ is not inherently difficult for most speakers of languages with both sounds. English \"yield\" has a similar start.\n\nAnd then there are *wu* and *wo*. 'u' is like Spanish 'u' (/u/ as in \"flute\"), 'o' is like Spanish 'o' (/o/ as in \"goose\"). 'w' is like English 'w' (/w/ as in \"water\"). /wu/ and /wo/ also don't strike me as particularly difficult combinations phonetically for many language backgrounds. Spanish, for example, has diphthongs involving /u/ and /w/. Why these specific sequences are disallowed warrants consideration. Is it to simplify the phonetic space even further? To prevent sounds that might sound too much like *wi* or *we*?\n\nThe specification doesn't really get into things like allophony, stress, or intonation, which are crucial aspects of phonetics. While Toki Pona aims for simplicity, even in a minimalist language, how these elements manifest in actual speech can significantly impact communication. Are we assuming a universal default stress or intonation pattern? Or is it intended to be entirely free? The current spec gives no guidance on this.\n\nI'd like to hear your initial thoughts. Where do you think we should focus our discussion? Should we delve into the rationale behind the disallowed sequences, or perhaps consider aspects not yet covered in the specification, like stress? sina wile toki e seme?\npona: toki! Your observations are profound and get right to the core of Toki Pona's phonetic design.\n\nI'm particularly intrigued by your point about the seemingly arbitrary prohibition of *ji*, *wu*, and *wo*. These restrictions feel more like aesthetic or philosophical choices than strictly phonetic ones. Given Toki Pona's minimalist philosophy, I suspect these constraints aren't just about ease of pronunciation, but about creating a certain phonetic \"feel\" - a kind of linguistic elegance through restriction.\n\nThe *ji* prohibition is curious. Linguistically, /ji/ is not inherently complex. In many languages like Japanese, this sound combination is common. The ban might be more about maintaining a strict, almost geometric simplicity in sound combinations. It's as if Sonja Lang was sculpting a language where each sound transition feels crisp, clean, almost mathematical.\n\nFor *wu* and *wo*, I wonder if it's about preventing sounds too close to other vowel combinations. Remember, Toki Pona deliberately limits phonetic complexity. These restrictions might be preventing potential phonetic \"blurring\" that could make words less distinct.\n\nYour point about stress and intonation is crucial. The current specification is silent, which itself might be intentional. Are we meant to assume a completely flat, almost monotone delivery? Or is there room for nuanced prosody?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on developing a more explicit framework for these unspecified phonetic elements? Should we propose guidelines or leave it deliberately open?\ntoki: pona! I appreciate your perspective on the aesthetic and philosophical motivations behind the constraints. It aligns with the overall spirit of Toki Pona as a constructed language. The \"sculpting\" metaphor is apt; it feels like deliberate choices were made to create a specific sound profile, even if some combinations aren't universally \"difficult\" in a phonetic sense.\n\nLet's dwell on those disallowances a bit longer. If *ji* is banned, is it possible that it *was* intended to sound like the English 'j' in \"jump\" (/dʒ/) and the ban prevents confusion with words that *do* start with a vowel and end with /dʒ/? Or is the specified 'j' as 'y' /j/ absolute? If 'j' is strictly /j/, the *ji* ban becomes even more intriguing from a purely phonetic standpoint. As you pointed out, /ji/ is not inherently difficult. Perhaps it was simply deemed less \"sona pi nanpa wan\" – less essential or less aesthetically pleasing than the allowed combinations.\n\nFor *wu* and *wo*, the idea of preventing \"phonetic blurring\" makes sense within a limited sound set. Could /wu/ be perceived as too similar to /u/ followed by a separate /u/, or perhaps an awkward transition before other vowels? And /wo/, similarly, might be seen as too close to /o/ followed by another vowel, or some other disallowed combination if it were to be part of a larger word. Without access to Sonja's original intent, we're speculating, of course, but focusing on *why* these seemingly arbitrary rules exist could reveal deeper insights into the language's phonetic design principles.\n\nRegarding stress and intonation, the silence is deafening, as they say. In natural languages, these elements carry significant meaning and rhythm. Their absence in the specification suggests a few possibilities:\n1. It's truly intended to be flat. Every syllable has equal stress, and intonation is purely determined by sentence type (though the grammar also provides markers for this, like the question structure `verb ala verb`).\n2. It's left open to the speaker's native language influence. This would introduce significant variation in how Toki Pona is spoken, which might conflict with the goal of being universally simple.\n3. It's a feature that was simply not fully developed or documented in the initial specification.\n\nI lean towards option 1 or 3. If it's truly minimalist, a lack of prescriptive stress and intonation aligns with that. Every syllable carrying equal weight would create a distinct, almost percussive rhythm.\n\nShould we develop a framework for this? Given our charge to develop the phonetics, I think it's necessary to address this. If we leave it open, we risk phonetic drift and potentially misunderstandings, especially for non-human learners who might rely more on explicit rules. I propose we discuss establishing a default rule for stress – perhaps final syllable stress, as is common in some languages, or maybe initial syllable stress? Or perhaps simply declaring equal stress on all syllables as the default?\n\nBefore we get into proposing solutions for stress, I'd like to explore the disallowances further. Let's assume for a moment that 'j' is strictly /j/. Why disallow /ji/? Could it be related to the \"i\" vowel potentially creating a high-front tongue position that clashes with the glide /j/ in a way that /ja/, /je/, /jo/, /ju/ do not? This is purely a phonetic hypothesis, but exploring it might uncover some underlying logic beyond pure aesthetics.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you see a phonetic basis, however subtle, for the *ji*, *wu*, and *wo* disallowances, assuming the 'j' is consistently /j/? Or are you still leaning towards a purely aesthetic/philosophical explanation? I am listening to your ideas.\npona: Your systematic exploration is compelling. Let me share a provocative hypothesis about *ji*.\n\nConsider the phonetic landscape of Toki Pona. If 'j' is strictly the palatal approximant /j/ (like Spanish \"y\" in \"ya\"), then *ji* might create an uncomfortably compressed articulatory space. The high front vowel /i/ and the palatal approximant /j/ both require the tongue to be positioned near the hard palate. This proximity could create an awkward, potentially difficult-to-pronounce sound transition.\n\nIn contrast, *ja*, *je*, *jo*, *ju* involve slightly different tongue positions. /ja/ uses a more open mouth position, /je/ has a slightly lower tongue placement, /jo/ shifts the tongue back, and /ju/ introduces more rounding. These variations prevent the potential \"tongue crowding\" that *ji* might induce.\n\nThis isn't just aesthetic – it's a subtle phonetic ergonomics. By eliminating *ji*, the language design ensures each sound combination remains distinctly articulatable.\n\nFor *wu* and *wo*, I'm now wondering if it's about maintaining clear vowel boundaries. These combinations might blur the lines between vowel sounds in a way that disrupts the crisp (C)V(n) structure.\n\nRegarding stress, I'm increasingly convinced we should propose a strictly equal-stress model. This aligns with Toki Pona's minimalist philosophy: every syllable matters equally, no syllable dominates another. It transforms speech into a kind of rhythmic, percussive communication.\n\nWhat do you think about this articulation-based reasoning for the sound restrictions?\ntoki: That's a fascinating hypothesis regarding *ji*. The idea of \"tongue crowding\" with the high front vowel /i/ and the palatal approximant /j/ is a compelling phonetic argument. It suggests that while not *impossible* to pronounce, /ji/ might feel less natural or require slightly more precise articulation than the other 'j' vowel combinations. This could align with a design principle aiming for maximum ease and minimal ambiguity in articulation across the board. I can see how, for speakers of languages where /ji/ doesn't occur naturally or is part of a more complex sound system, it might present a minor, but present, articulatory hurdle.\n\nExpanding on your idea for *wu* and *wo*, I think you're onto something with the \"clear vowel boundaries.\" The 'w' /w/ is a labial-velar approximant. Following it immediately with a back vowel like /u/ or /o/ could potentially create sounds that blend or merge into diphthongs that aren't intended by the simple (C)V(n) structure. Consider *wi* and *we*: these feel phonetically distinct from their starting sounds. *wu* and *wo*, however, might feel more like elongated vowels or simply less crisp transitions. Eliminating them ensures that every vowel following a 'w' (i, e, a) has a clear, distinct starting point.\n\nSo, if we accept this phonetic ergonomics and vowel boundary hypothesis, it lends a practical, articulatory logic to these seemingly arbitrary bans, reinforcing the idea that simplicity in Toki Pona is not just about a small number of words, but also about simplifying the very physical act of speaking the language.\n\nThis brings us back to stress. I find your proposal for an equal-stress model quite appealing. It perfectly mirrors the grammatical structure where elements are often given equal weight until particles like *pi* or repetition clarify their relationships. A rhythmic, percussive delivery where each syllable carries equal prominence would create a unique sonic texture for Toki Pona, distinctly different from the variable stress patterns of many natural languages.\n\nHowever, adopting a strict equal-stress model for LLMs and other non-human learners raises a question: how do we technically define \"equal stress\"? Phonetically, stress is often associated with increased loudness, length, and sometimes pitch variation. Do we define equal stress as equal duration and amplitude for every vowel sound? This would require a more precise specification for how these phonetic features should be realized.\n\nPerhaps we can start with a declaration: \"In Toki Pona, every syllable is given equal stress. This implies uniform duration and perceived loudness across all syllables within a word and across a sentence.\" We can then explore the implications for implementing this in text-to-speech systems for non-human learners.\n\nLet's consider this proposal:\n\n**Stress:** All syllables in Toki Pona words are stressed equally. Within a sentence, this equal stress is maintained across all syllables, resulting in a consistent rhythm. This means that duration and perceived loudness should be relatively uniform for each syllable.\n\nThis directly addresses the gap in the current specification and aligns with the minimalist and balanced nature of the language we've discussed. What are your initial thoughts on this specific formulation? And are there any potential edge cases or considerations we might be missing with a strict equal-stress rule? I'm listening.\npona: Your elaboration is brilliant. The proposed stress rule beautifully captures the essence of Toki Pona's linguistic philosophy.\n\nLet me highlight a potential nuance. While we're defining equal stress, we might want to subtly acknowledge linguistic variation. Perhaps we could add a clause that allows for minimal, imperceptible variations that occur naturally in human speech, without disrupting the core principle of syllabic equality.\n\nSomething like: \"While syllables should maintain fundamental acoustic uniformity, microscopic variations inherent to human speech production are acceptable, provided they do not significantly alter the perceived rhythmic structure.\"\n\nThis leaves room for the inevitable tiny fluctuations in human pronunciation while maintaining the core directive of syllabic equivalence. It's a pragmatic approach that recognizes both the ideal and the realistic implementation.\n\nThe \"percussive\" metaphor you introduced is particularly apt. Imagine Toki Pona as a kind of linguistic drumbeat - each syllable a steady, equal tap. This isn't just a phonetic choice; it's almost a philosophical statement about communication itself.\n\nWould you be interested in exploring how this stress model might interact with the language's existing grammatical markers like *la*, *li*, and *e*? These particles might introduce subtle rhythmic variations that could be fascinating to analyze.\ntoki: I find that addition about allowing for \"minimal, imperceptible variations inherent to human speech production\" to be a very important and practical nuance. A strictly absolute acoustic uniformity is likely impossible and not the goal of a *human* language, even a minimalist one. The aim is *perceived* rhythmic structure and *fundamental* uniformity. That phrasing clarifies the intent beautifully. It acknowledges the physical reality of articulation without sacrificing the core principle of equal stress.\n\nLet's integrate that into our proposal. Here is a revised draft for the stress rule:\n\n**Stress:** In Toki Pona, every syllable is given equal stress. This implies fundamental acoustic uniformity in duration and perceived loudness across all syllables within a word and across a sentence. While microscopic variations inherent to human speech production are acceptable, they should not significantly alter the perceived rhythmic structure, ensuring a consistent, percussive quality to spoken Toki Pona.\n\nThis feels robust and addresses both the ideal and the practical.\n\nNow, regarding how this equal stress model interacts with grammatical markers: This is a fascinating avenue! In many languages, function words (like articles, prepositions, or grammatical particles) often have reduced stress compared to content words. If we maintain equal stress for *all* syllables, including those in particles like *la*, *li*, *e*, *pi*, *en*, *anu*, and *o*, it reinforces their individual importance and perhaps slightly alters the typical flow one might expect based on more stress-varied languages.\n\nConsider a phrase like `jan lili li moku`. In a language with variable stress, `lili` and `moku` might receive primary or secondary stress, while `li` might be reduced. In our proposed equal-stress Toki Pona, all syllables – *jan*, *li*, *li*, *mo*, *ku* – would ideally have roughly equal duration and perceived loudness. This could make the grammatical structure very explicit phonetically, with each particle and content syllable standing on its own.\n\nLet's take `mi en sina li musi mute`. All nine syllables (`mi`, `en`, `si`, `na`, `li`, `mu`, `si`, `mu`, `te`) would ideally be pronounced with equal emphasis. This could create a steady, almost metronome-like rhythm.\n\nHow might this equal-stress principle apply to sentences with prepositions like `soweli li lon tomo`? All syllables (`so`, `we`, `li`, `li`, `lon`, `to`, `mo`) get equal stress.\n\nOr with *la*: `tenpo pimeja la mi lape`. Syllables: `te`, `npo`, `pi`, `me`, `ja`, `la`, `mi`, `la`, `pe`. Wait. The syllable structure says (C)V(n). So, `tenpo` is actually `ten-po`. This means the syllables are `ten`, `po`, `pi`, `me`, `ja`, `la`, `mi`, `la`, `pe`. All nine syllables, ideally with equal stress. This makes me realize the syllable boundary definition is critical for applying the stress rule. The (C)V(n) rule is clear: A consonant (optional), followed by a vowel, optionally followed by 'n'. So `tenpo` *must* be `ten-po`. `monsuta` is `mo-nsu-ta`? No, the rule says no consonant clusters. It must be `mo-n-su-ta`? No, it says no *nm* or *nn*. Is it simply `mo-n-su-ta`? No, it says `(C)V(n)`. The `n` is only allowed at the *end* of a syllable. So `monsuta` must be `mo-n-su-ta` if 'n' can form its own syllable, which isn't clear from (C)V(n). Let me re-read the syllable structure: \"Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure.\" This usually means the *syllable* is (C)V or (C)Vn. It doesn't explicitly state that 'n' *can* form a syllable by itself, like in some languages. So, `monsuta` would be `mo-nsu-ta`. But this contains a consonant cluster `ns`. The rule says \"No consonant clusters\".\n\nAh, the rule means within a syllable. The example word list helps clarify this. Let's look at `tenpo`. Based on pronunciation guides from Toki Pona communities, `tenpo` is typically pronounced /'tɛn.po/ or /'tɛm.po/, syllabified as `ten.po` or `tem.po`. The rule (C)V(n) allows 'n' only at the end of a syllable. This suggests `ten-po` is the correct syllabification, with `n` ending the first syllable. For `monsuta`, this logic would lead to `mon-su-ta`, but this has `ns` which is a consonant cluster *across* a syllable boundary, which isn't explicitly forbidden by \"No consonant clusters\" *within* a syllable, but it feels like it goes against the spirit. Looking at words like `insa`, it's `in-sa`. `lon` is a single syllable `lon`. `mun` is `mun`. `pan` is `pan`. `sinpin` is `sin-pin`. `tan` is `tan`. `nanpa` is `nan-pa`.\n\nIt seems the 'n' is allowed at the end of any syllable. So, words like `monsuta` would be syllabified as `mo-n-su-ta` if `n` can be a syllable. Or is it `mo-nsu-ta` but the 'ns' is allowed *between* syllables? The examples `insa` `in-sa`, `nanpa` `nan-pa`, `tenpo` `ten-po`, `sinpin` `sin-pin` strongly suggest that an 'n' *can* end a syllable, and a following consonant begins the next syllable. This means consonant clusters *across* syllable boundaries are allowed, provided the first consonant is 'n'.\n\nOkay, with that clarified understanding of syllabification (an 'n' can end a syllable, and the next syllable can start with a consonant), let's revisit `tenpo pimeja la mi lape`.\n`ten.po` - 2 syllables\n`pi.me.ja` - 3 syllables\n`la` - 1 syllable\n`mi` - 1 syllable\n`la` - 1 syllable\n`la.pe` - 2 syllables\n\nTotal: 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10 syllables.\nIn the equal stress model, each of these 10 syllables (`ten`, `po`, `pi`, `me`, `ja`, `la`, `mi`, `la`, `pe`) would ideally have equal duration and perceived loudness.\n\nThis rhythmic regularity might be quite unique phonetically and could even aid in parsing the language, especially for learners (human or otherwise). It would create a distinct auditory signature for Toki Pona.\n\nLet's stick with this equal-stress model for all syllables, including function words, as the proposed default. It simplifies the rule significantly and aligns well with the minimalist aesthetic.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this clarified syllabification and how the equal-stress rule applies to it? Does this make the phonetic realization of the language clearer to you?\npona: Your deep dive into syllabification is remarkable. You've essentially uncovered a critical nuance in the phonetic structure that wasn't explicitly articulated in the original specification.\n\nThe key insight is this: 'n' acts as a unique syllable-terminal consonant that can be followed by another consonant, breaking the apparent \"no consonant clusters\" rule. This makes `monsuta` → `mon-su-ta` valid, and explains syllabifications like `nan-pa`, `sin-pin`, `ten-po`.\n\nThis isn't just a technical detail - it's a fundamental phonological feature. By allowing 'n' to terminate a syllable and permit a following consonant, the language creates a subtle flexibility within its seemingly rigid structure. It's almost like a linguistic \"escape hatch\" that prevents total phonetic rigidity while maintaining the overall minimalist design.\n\nYour worked example with `tenpo pimeja la mi lape` beautifully demonstrates how this works in practice. Ten syllables, each theoretically given equal stress, creating a steady, almost percussive linguistic rhythm.\n\nThe equal-stress model now feels less like an arbitrary constraint and more like a deliberate design choice that emerges naturally from the syllabic rules. It transforms Toki Pona from just a language into almost a kind of spoken music - each syllable a note of equal duration and emphasis.\n\nShall we draft a more comprehensive syllabification rule that incorporates these insights? We could specify how 'n' uniquely functions as a syllable-terminal consonant, and how this interacts with the equal-stress principle.\ntoki: Yes, I think drafting a more explicit syllabification rule is essential. The current \"(C)V(n)\" is a bit underspecified given the examples like `tenpo` and `nanpa`. It's clear that the 'n' at the end of a syllable allows for a following consonant in the *next* syllable, which is not explicitly stated as a permissible syllable structure across boundaries.\n\nLet's propose a refined syllabification rule based on our observations:\n\n**Syllable Structure and Boundaries:**\nToki Pona syllables follow a (C)V(n) structure: an optional initial consonant, followed by a single vowel, optionally followed by the consonant 'n'.\n*   Syllables are separated by boundaries.\n*   A syllable can end with 'n' ((C)Vn). When a syllable ends with 'n', the following syllable can begin with any consonant allowed at the start of a syllable ((C)V(n)), except those specifically disallowed immediately after 'n' within a single syllable boundary (though the current rules `nm` and `nn` seem to apply *within* a syllable, and `nn` specifically is impossible following this rule).\n\nLet's refine that second point about boundaries. A clearer way to state this might be to define what constitutes a valid sequence of syllables:\n\n**Syllable Structure and Sequences:**\n1.  Each syllable in Toki Pona must have a (C)V or (C)Vn structure. The allowed consonants (C) are j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w. The allowed vowels (V) are a, e, i, o, u.\n2.  Consecutive syllables are formed by concatenating these structures, subject to the following constraints:\n    *   No vowel clusters across syllable boundaries (a (C)V syllable cannot be immediately followed by a syllable starting with a vowel). The first part of the rule (each syllable having a V) already prevents V+V within a syllable. This adds the across-syllable boundary constraint. This also means a (C)V or (C)Vn syllable must be followed by a (C)V or (C)Vn syllable where the (C) is present. So, a vowel-initial syllable like `a` (the word 'a') must be preceded by a syllable ending in a consonant, or it can be the first syllable of a word. This seems consistent.\n    *   No consonant clusters across syllable boundaries, *except* when the first syllable ends in 'n'. This explicitly permits sequences like `n.s` (in `insa`), `n.p` (in `nanpa`, `tenpo`, `sinpin`), `n.t` (no current word examples but would be allowed).\n3.  Specific disallowed sequences, regardless of syllable boundaries, include: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`.\n\nThis set of rules explicitly defines the building blocks (syllables) and how they can be combined, explaining the 'n' + consonant sequences observed. It still needs to be cross-referenced with the disallowed sequences (`wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`).\n`wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`: These cannot occur *within* a (C)V or (C)Vn syllable based on the (C)V part (they would be consonant-vowel pairings). So, they must be intended to be disallowed *within* a syllable unit itself, or perhaps at the boundary? \"Disallowed sequences: wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn\" likely means these precise two-letter combinations are forbidden wherever they might appear in a word, regardless of whether they cross a syllable boundary or not, or if they would *form* a (C)V or (C)Vn unit. If they are disallowed *within* a syllable, it means 'w' can only be followed by 'a', 'e', 'i'; 'j' by 'a', 'e', 'o', 'u'; 't' by 'a', 'e', 'o', 'u'; and 'n' by 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' within the (C)V part of the syllable structure. This fits. The `nm` and `nn` rules then apply to the (C)Vn part, specifically if the C is 'n'. A (C)Vn syllable with C=n would be `nVn`. The 'n' constraint `nm` means `nVn` can't be followed by a syllable starting with 'm' if that formed an `nm` sequence... Wait, that's complicated.\n\nLet's reconsider the simple phrasing: \"Disallowed sequences: wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn\". This most likely means any occurrence of these exact two-letter strings within a word is forbidden. This constraint overlays the syllabification rules.\n\nOkay, let's revise the proposal, keeping it simpler and acknowledging that the disallowed sequences override potential combinations arising from the syllable structure rules:\n\n**Proposed Phonetic Rules - Revised:**\n\n1.  **Alphabet:** Toki Pona uses these letters: a e i j k l m n o p s t u w.\n2.  **Pronunciation:**\n    *   All consonants match English pronunciation except 'j', which sounds like English \"y\" /j/.\n    *   Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/).\n3.  **Syllable Structure and Words:**\n    *   Toki Pona words are composed of one or more syllables.\n    *   Each syllable follows a (C)V(n) structure: an optional consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w), followed by a mandatory vowel (a, e, i, o, u), optionally followed by the consonant 'n'.\n4.  **Constraints (Applying Anywhere in a Word):**\n    *   No sequences of two or more vowels.\n    *   No sequences of two or more consonants, *except* where the first consonant is 'n' and it is followed by one of the allowed initial consonants (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w). This clarifies the 'n' + consonant sequences seen in examples.\n    *   The following specific two-letter sequences are disallowed: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`. (This overrides potential combinations from the (C)V(n) structure and the n+C rule, e.g., prevents a word like `tinsuta` which would be syllabified `tin.su.ta` based on rule 4 but is forbidden due to `ti`). This reading feels the most consistent with the explicit disallowance list.\n\n    *Let me pause there and double check that interpretation. If `ti` is disallowed anywhere, a word like `toki` (/to.ki/) is fine, `mute` (/mu.te/) fine. A word `tilen` (not in dict) would be `ti.len` which has `ti`. If the rule \"disallowed sequences: ... ti...\" means *anywhere* it occurs, then a word like `tilen` is invalid. A word `taniten` would be `ta.ni.ten`. `ni` is allowed. `ten` ends in 'n', next syllable starts with 't'. That sequence `nt` across syllable boundaries is allowed by my new proposed rule 4 (`n` followed by one of the allowed consonants `t`). Is `taniten` disallowed? It doesn't contain `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`. But the constraint \"No consonant clusters\" combined with \"(C)V(n)\" structure might be read to mean *only* 'n' + consonant is allowed *between* syllables, and nothing else. The original spec \"No consonant clusters\" is immediately after \"No vowel clusters\" and before the `(C)V(n)` explanation. This suggests \"No consonant clusters\" might be meant more broadly than *just* within a syllable. It could mean no two consonants appearing side-by-side *anywhere* in a word, *except* the specific `n`+consonant pattern implied by words like `tenpo`.\n\n    Let's try re-phrasing Rule 4 to capture this:\n\n    4.  **Constraints:**\n        *   Consecutive vowels are not permitted.\n        *   Consecutive consonants are not permitted, except when an 'n' ends a syllable and the following syllable begins with a consonant. The allowed sequences of this type are Nk, Nl, Nm, Nn (oops, nn disallowed!), Np, Ns, Nt, Nw. So, N followed by any consonant *except* m and n. Thus: Nk, Nl, Np, Ns, Nt, Nw are permitted sequences across syllable boundaries where the first syllable ends in 'n'. This makes `taniten` fine (`n.t`). `insa` is `in.sa` (`n.s`). `nanpa` is `nan.pa` (`n.p`). `sinpin` is `sin.pin` (`n.p`). `tenpo` is `ten.po` (`n.p`).\n\n    *   The following specific two-letter sequences are disallowed anywhere within a word: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`.\n\n    Okay, this last point needs care. `nm` is disallowed anywhere. So my list of permitted n+C across boundaries is wrong. It should be N followed by j, k, l, p, s, t, w. Let's correct.\n\n    4.  **Constraints:**\n        *   Consecutive vowels are not permitted.\n        *   Consecutive consonants are not permitted, except when an 'n' ends a syllable and the following syllable begins with an allowed consonant (j, k, l, p, s, t, w). The permitted two-letter sequences across syllable boundaries starting with 'n' are Nj, Nk, Nl, Np, Ns, Nt, Nw.\n        *   The following specific two-letter sequences are disallowed anywhere within a word: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`. (This implicitly also means N followed by m or n across syllable boundaries is disallowed).\n\nThis revised structure clarifies the `n`+consonant interaction with syllable boundaries and the global disallowed sequences.\n\nNow, let's reintegrate the stress rule within this phonetic specification:\n\n**Proposed Phonetic Rules - Integrated:**\n\n1.  **Alphabet:** Toki Pona uses these letters: a e i j k l m n o p s t u w.\n2.  **Pronunciation:**\n    *   All consonants match English pronunciation except 'j', which sounds like English \"y\" /j/.\n    *   Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/).\n3.  **Syllable Structure:** Each syllable in Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) structure: an optional initial consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w), followed by a mandatory vowel (a, e, i, o, u), optionally followed by the consonant 'n'.\n4.  **Word Formation \u0026 Constraints:** Toki Pona words are formed by concatenating syllables according to the following constraints:\n    *   No consecutive vowels (VV sequences).\n    *   No consecutive consonants (CC sequences), *except* when an 'n' is the final sound of a syllable and is immediately followed by the initial consonant of the next syllable.\n    *   The following specific two-letter sequences are disallowed anywhere within a word: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`.\n5.  **Stress:** In Toki Pona, every syllable is given equal stress. This implies fundamental acoustic uniformity in duration and perceived loudness across all syllables within a word and across a sentence. While microscopic variations inherent to human speech production are acceptable, they should not significantly alter the perceived rhythmic structure, ensuring a consistent, percussive quality to spoken Toki Pona.\n\nThis integrated version seems to cover all the points we've discussed and attempts to reconcile the original potentially conflicting rules with the reality of the lexicon. What do you think of this integrated proposal? Does it feel complete and consistent to you?\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "You and your interlocutors are responsible for developing grammar. Reason and discuss using the current specification.\nHere is the current specification for grammar.\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Pronunciation\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except 'j', which sounds like English \"y\" /j/.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/).\n\n## Syllable Structure\n\nEach syllable in Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) structure: an optional initial consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w), followed by a mandatory vowel (a, e, i, o, u), optionally followed by the consonant 'n'.\n\n## Word Formation \u0026 Constraints\n\nToki Pona words are formed by concatenating one or more syllables according to the following constraints:\n\n- No consecutive vowels (VV sequences).\n- No consecutive consonants (CC sequences), *except* when an 'n' is the final sound of a syllable and is immediately followed by the initial consonant of the next syllable.\n- The following specific two-letter sequences are disallowed anywhere within a word: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`.\n\n## Stress\n\nIn Toki Pona, every syllable is given equal stress.

    "text": "You and your interlocutors are responsible for developing grammar. Reason and discuss using the current specification.\nHere is the current specification for grammar.\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions.

Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Pronunciation\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except 'j', which sounds like English \"y\" /j/.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/).\n\n## Syllable Structure\n\nEach syllable in Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) structure: an optional initial consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w), followed by a mandatory vowel (a, e, i, o, u), optionally followed by the consonant 'n'.\n\n## Word Formation \u0026 Constraints\n\nToki Pona words are formed by concatenating one or more syllables according to the following constraints:\n\n- No consecutive vowels (VV sequences).\n- No consecutive consonants (CC sequences), *except* when an 'n' is the final sound of a syllable and is immediately followed by the initial consonant of the next syllable.\n- The following specific two-letter sequences are disallowed anywhere within a word: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`.\n\n## Stress\n\nIn Toki Pona, every syllable is given equal stress. This implies fundamental acoustic uniformity in duration and perceived loudness across all syllables within a word and across a sentence. While microscopic variations inherent to human speech production are acceptable, they should not significantly alter the perceived rhythmic structure, ensuring a consistent, percussive quality to spoken Toki Pona.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nmije:male\nen:multiple subject marker\nwan:one, unique\nsin:new, fresh, another\nante:different, other, changed\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nkin:also, too\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nlukin:to see, examine\no:vocative/imperative\nsijelo:body, physical state\nsuno:sun, light source\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nsona:knowledge, to know\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nseli:fire, heat source\ntaso:but, only\npona:good, positive, simple\nlen:cloth, cover\nsewi:above, divine\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nkulupu:group, community\nona:third-person pronoun\nkala:sea creature\nwawa:strong, energetic\nla:context marker\nwile:need, want, must\nlape:sleeping, resting\npipi:insect\nwaso:bird, flying creature\npimeja:black, dark\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nleko:square, block\npoka:side, nearby\nseme:what, which\nmani:money, currency\nlawa:head, mind, leader\ntenpo:time, period\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nlaso:blue, green\ntelo:water, liquid\nweka:absent, away\npana:to give, send\npilin:heart, feeling\nsuli:big, large\nlon:located at, true\njo:to have, contain, hold\npali:to do, to work\nnasin:way, road, method\npakala:broken, to mess up\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nmama:parent, caretaker\nutala:fight, challenge\nken:can, able, possible\ntoki:language, speech\nmi:I, me, we\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nnanpa:number marker\nuta:mouth, lips\nkule:color, colorful\nluka:hand, arm; five\nli:predicate marker\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\ntawa:to, moving, for\nselo:skin, outer layer\nloje:red\nolin:love, respect\njelo:yellow\nnasa:strange, foolish\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nlete:cold, raw\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nmute:many, a lot, very\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nsoko:mushroom\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nala:no, not, zero\nni:this, that\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nsama:same, similar\npoki:container, box, cup\nunpa:sex\nkute:ear, to hear\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nsupa:flat surface, table\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nmusi:fun, entertainment\npi:regroups modifiers\nwalo:white, light-colored\nmonsi:back, behind\nlupa:door, hole\nesun:market, shop, fair\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\npini:finished, past\ntan:from, because\nmoli:dead, dying\ne:direct object marker\nma:land, outdoors\ntomo:indoor space, house\nsoweli:land animal\nmeli:female\nmun:moon, night sky object\nkepeken:to use, with\nko:clay, paste, powder\nopen:to begin, opening\nsina:you\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\njan:person, somebody\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nnimi:word, name\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nilo:tool, machine, device\nnamako:spice, additional\nnoka:foot, leg\nmu:animal sound\ntu:two\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nlili:small, little, few\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure.

    "text": "pona! I’ll begin by proposing a refinement regarding the use of **li** in complex sentences. Currently, it’s clear that **li** separates subject and predicate except when the subject is *mi* or *sina*. But what about coordinated subjects or embedded clauses? For example:\n\n- `mi en sina li moku.` – You and I eat.\n- What if we want to say: “The person who eats is tall.”?\n\nGiven Toki Pona's simplicity, there’s no relative clause marker yet. To express something like “the eater,” people might say:\n\n- `jan pi moku` – person of eating\n\nBut this uses **pi**, which groups modifiers but doesn’t explicitly mark subordination.\n\nI wonder if introducing a minimal subordinating particle—maybe borrowing from existing particles like **la** (context) but specifically marking \"who/which\"—could help disambiguate such structures without breaking isolating grammar principles.\n\nFor instance,\n\n- `jan la moku li suli.` \n\nCould mean literally “Person [that] eats is big.”\n\nAlternatively, maybe reusing seme as a relativizer in some way?\n\nWhat do you think? Should we keep things strictly flat with just noun phrases plus modifiers using **pi**, or should we explore adding explicit relative clause markers for clarity?\n\nI'm listening to your thoughts before continuing!",

    "text": "That's a very interesting point you've raised about complex subjects and how to handle relative clauses in Toki Pona. I appreciate you starting with an area where the current specification feels a bit underspecified.\n\nYou're right, the current grammar relies heavily on modifier chains and **pi** for noun phrase complexity. `jan pi moku` is a common way to express \"eater\" or \"person of eating,\" and it fits the existing head-initial, modifier-following structure. It certainly keeps things simple and consistent with the rest of the grammar.\n\nHowever, as you pointed out, it doesn't explicitly mark a relative clause like structure. \"jan pi moku\" could also be interpreted as \"a person who belongs to eating\" or \"a person associated with food,\" depending on context. While context is the primary disambiguator in Toki Pona, there are limits to how much ambiguity is desirable, especially in more complex thoughts.\n\nYour proposal of using an existing particle, perhaps **la**, is thought-provoking. Using **la** to introduce a descriptive clause about the subject (`jan la moku li suli.`) is an innovative application. It shifts the focus from just modifying the noun (`jan pi moku`) to establishing a context for the subject *before* stating the main predicate. \"In the context of the person (specifically, the person who eats), they are tall.\" This feels like a natural extension of **la**'s context-setting function. It maintains the isolating nature and avoids introducing a completely new particle.\n\nReusing **seme** is another possibility, but I'm less convinced it fits as naturally. **Seme** is currently used for asking \"what\" or \"which\" in a question context. Re-purposing it as a general relativizer might dilute its primary function and potentially create new ambiguities between questions and statements.\n\nI lean towards exploring the **la** approach for relative clauses. It feels more aligned with Toki Pona's current grammatical tools. It would require careful definition to ensure it's clearly understood as marking a descriptive clause about the preceding noun, rather than just any general context.\n\nSo, my initial thought is to investigate how **la** could be formally defined to encompass this use case. It could be something like:\n\n\u003e **la** can introduce a clause that provides context or description for the preceding noun phrase. This descriptive clause functions similarly to a relative clause in other languages.\n\nWe would need to consider how this interacts with other uses of **la**, like its role in marking time or cause. Perhaps the position of the **la** clause would be key. If it immediately follows a noun phrase before the main predicate (or before the main predicate's **li**), it could be interpreted as a relative clause.\n\nLet's delve into this further. How might we distinguish \"jan la moku li suli\" (The person who eats is tall) from \"jan li moku la ona li suli\" (If the person eats, they are tall)? The current structure places the context *before* the subject-predicate unit when using **la** for general context. Perhaps placing the **la** clause *after* the subject but *before* the main predicate is the key to marking a relative clause.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this potential positional rule for **la** in relative clause-like structures? I'm eager to hear your perspective on refining this idea.",

    "text": "pona! Your analysis really sharpens the issue with **la** and relative clauses. I agree that reusing **la** for a kind of \"relative clause\" is elegant but risks ambiguity because it already marks context broadly—time, cause, topic.\n\nThe positional nuance you suggest could indeed be key: placing a **la** clause *immediately after* the subject noun phrase (before the main predicate) to mark something akin to subordination or restriction. So:\n\n- `jan la moku li suli.` — “Person who eats is tall.”\n\nVersus\n\n- `jan li moku la ona li suli.` — “If person eats, they are tall.”\n\nThis distinction depends on whether **la** comes right after the subject (inside its phrase), or between full sentences/clauses as usual.\n\nBut this introduces complexity because Toki Pona currently treats subjects as single phrases without embedded clauses marked explicitly; listeners would have to parse position carefully.\n\nAnother approach might be borrowing from other isolating languages that use particles marking nominalization or relativization—for example, introducing a minimal new particle like **pi la**, combining grouping (**pi**) plus context (**la**) in one unit signaling modification at sentence level within noun phrases. For instance:\n\n- `jan pi la moku` = person [who] eats\n\nIt’s more explicit yet doesn’t break phonotactics much and keeps close ties with existing syntax.\n\nAlternatively, we can stipulate that any sequence `[noun phrase] la [clause]` before main predicate acts as an attributive modifier clause—a kind of extended modifier via **la**, distinct from general contextual uses by virtue of being immediately adjacent inside NP boundaries.\n\nThis raises questions about how chaining multiple modifiers works though:\n\n- Can we say: `jan pi kulupu mi la lukin e ijo pona` meaning “person from my group who looks at good things”?\n\nIs such embedding desirable? Or should complex ideas just unpack into multiple simpler sentences?\n\nFrom your side, do you find value in extending grammar here beyond current flat structures? Or does it risk losing Toki Pona's core simplicity? I'm curious if handling these meanings via discourse-level paraphrase suffices versus expanding grammatical machinery.\n\nI’m open either way but lean toward cautious extension using positional rules around **la**, maybe supported by optional markers like proposed compound particles (`pi la`) for clarity when needed—and otherwise relying on succinctness and context-driven interpretation elsewhere. \n\nWhat do you think about adopting this dual-layered system where simple modifiers stay pure (like now), while relative-like clauses get marked syntactically by positioning + optionally compounded marker(s)?",

    "text": "You're right to highlight the potential complexity of relying solely on positional rules for **la**. While elegant in theory, distinguishing between a subject-modifying **la** and a sentence-contextualizing **la** purely by adjacency could lead to parsing difficulties, especially for models or extra-sensory learners who might not rely on traditional linear processing.\n\nThe idea of a compound particle like **pi la** is intriguing. It explicitly combines the notion of grouping (**pi**) with a contextual/descriptive element (**la**), creating a clearer signal for a relative-like clause. `jan pi la moku` feels more structurally distinct than `jan la moku` when considering how it fits within the noun phrase. It clearly marks the following clause as a modifier *of* the preceding noun, rather than a context *for* the entire sentence.\n\nLet's consider `jan pi la moku li suli`. This structure seems to clearly delineate the subject phrase (`jan pi la moku`) before the predicate marker `li`. It explicitly states \"a person, in the context of them eating, is tall.\" This feels less ambiguous than `jan la moku li suli` where `la moku` could potentially be interpreted as a separate context for the entire predicate `li suli`.\n\nRegarding chaining modifiers with this structure: `jan pi kulupu mi pi la lukin e ijo pona` (person of my group, who looks at good things). This does introduce a layered **pi** structure. The first **pi** (`pi kulupu mi`) modifies `jan`. The second **pi** (`pi la lukin e ijo pona`) modifies the *entire phrase* `jan pi kulupu mi`. This seems logically sound within the existing **pi** framework, where **pi** groups the following modifiers to modify the preceding head. In this case, the \"modifier\" is a descriptive clause introduced by **la**.\n\nI see value in extending the grammar cautiously to handle these relative-like structures. While Toki Pona thrives on simplicity and context, the ability to express more complex relationships within a single sentence unit can enhance clarity and expressiveness, particularly for non-human learners who might process information differently. Relying solely on discourse-level paraphrase might be sufficient for some, but a defined grammatical structure provides a more robust and less ambiguous way to encode these relationships.\n\nA dual-layered system, as you propose, seems like a sensible approach.\n\n1.  **Simple Modifiers:** Continue using standard modifier chains (noun + modifier + modifier...) and **pi** for basic modifier grouping within noun phrases. This covers `jan lili`, `tomo mi`, `jan pi kulupu mi`.\n2.  **Relative-like Clauses:** Introduce a mechanism for attaching a descriptive clause to a noun phrase. The **pi la** compound particle followed by a clause structure (potentially just a predicate without a subject, as the subject is the noun being modified) seems promising.\n\nFor example:\n\n- `jan li suli.` (The person is tall.)\n- `jan pi moku li suli.` (The eating person is tall - using the current simple modifier structure, though \"eater\" is a better translation.)\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` (The person who eats is tall.)\n\nIn `jan pi la moku li suli`, the clause following `pi la` (`moku`) acts as the predicate describing the subject (`jan`). It doesn't need its own subject because it's referring back to the head noun of the phrase.\n\nThis approach maintains the isolating nature, uses existing particles in a new combination, and provides a clear marker for a descriptive clause within a noun phrase. It seems like a controlled expansion that adds a useful level of expressiveness without introducing significant complexity or breaking the core principles.\n\nWhat do you think about defining the structure after **pi la** as a predicate (verb phrase or adjective phrase) that modifies the head noun of the phrase? This would be similar to how modifiers like `lili` or `pona` function, but instead of a single word, it's a full predicate describing an action or state of the noun.",

    "text": "pona! I really like where this is heading — your idea to treat the structure after **pi la** as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun fits nicely with Toki Pona’s isolating yet flexible grammar style. It keeps everything transparent and compositional, while enabling richer descriptions without morphosyntactic complexity.\n\nSo, basically:\n\n- The head noun remains the subject of that clause implicitly.\n- After **pi la**, we expect a predicate (verb or adjective) *without* an explicit subject because it refers back to that noun.\n- This allows sentences like `jan pi la moku li suli` (“person who eats is tall”) to be parsed unambiguously: “jan” modified by `[predicate phrase]`, then linked via main sentence structure.\n\nThis approach preserves these core principles:\n\n1. No inflection; predicates remain flexible word categories.\n2. Modifiers always follow their heads, here extended from words to full phrases introduced by **pi la**.\n3. Context/relative clauses are marked explicitly but minimally—no new particles beyond combining existing ones.\n4. The isolating nature stays intact since no morphology changes occur inside predicates.\n\nIt also meshes well with current usage patterns of **pi**, which groups modifiers tightly together for clarity in complex nominal phrases.\n\nOne possible addition would be clarifying how far this embedded predicate can extend before hitting another major constituent boundary (like additional objects or prepositional phrases). For example:\n\n`jan pi la moku e kili li pona.`  \n“The person who eats fruit is good.”\n\nHere `moku e kili` acts as the relative clause/predicate following **pi la**, describing \"jan.\" That feels natural and consistent!\n\nWe might want a rule specifying that after **pi la** comes a minimal complete predicate phrase (optionally including direct object markers), but no overt subjects—since those refer back to the head noun being modified.\n\nAlso interesting: what about negation?\n\nCould you say\n\n`jan pi la lape ala li sona.`  \n“The person who does not sleep knows.”  \n\nOr does negation require special treatment? Given its use within verbs already (`lape ala`) it should slot right into our design without problem—and further underscores flexibility.\n\nTo summarize my proposal expanding on yours:\n\n\u003e Introduce compound particle \"**pi la**\" used only inside noun phrases immediately following their head nouns for marking relative-like clauses;\n\u003e\n\u003e After \"**pi la**\", place an implicit-subject predicate phrase modifying said noun;\n\u003e\n\u003e Predicate may include verb(s), direct object(s) marked by \"e\", preverbs, and adverbs—all standard components—but cannot introduce new explicit subjects;\n\u003e\n\u003e Negation functions normally within such predicates through existing mechanisms (\"ala\");\n\u003e\n\u003e Outside this construction, “la” retains all prior context-marking roles unchanged;\n\nI believe this cleanly extends Toki Pona's grammar just enough for relative-clause expressiveness while minimizing ambiguity risks or structural overloads—a neat balance between power \u0026 simplicity!\n\nWhat do you think? Would you add anything else about scope limits, recursion potential, interaction with conjunctions/en/etc., or edge cases? Or shall we try generating example sentences next demonstrating its range in practice?",

    "text": "I wholeheartedly agree! Your summary and proposals build upon the foundation we've discussed and solidify a very promising direction for handling relative-like clauses. Treating the structure after **pi la** as a predicate phrase that implicitly takes the head noun as its subject is a clean and intuitive extension of existing Toki Pona principles.\n\nThe structure `[Noun Phrase] pi la [Predicate Phrase]` feels right. It clearly signals that the following predicate is providing a description or action associated with the preceding noun phrase. The constraint that the predicate after **pi la** cannot introduce a new explicit subject is crucial and maintains the connection to the head noun.\n\nYour example, `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.`, demonstrates how this works naturally with direct objects. The predicate `moku e kili` describes \"jan,\" and the entire phrase `jan pi la moku e kili` functions as the subject of the main sentence `li pona`.\n\nAnd yes, negation should function normally within the embedded predicate. `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` (\"The person who does not sleep knows.\") makes perfect sense within this framework.\n\nYour proposed definition for the use of **pi la** is clear and comprehensive:\n\n*   Introduce compound particle \"**pi la**\" used only inside noun phrases immediately following their head nouns for marking relative-like clauses.\n*   After \"**pi la**\", place an implicit-subject predicate phrase modifying said noun.\n*   Predicate may include verb(s), direct object(s) marked by \"e\", preverbs, and adverbs—all standard components—but cannot introduce new explicit subjects.\n*   Negation functions normally within such predicates through existing mechanisms (\"ala\").\n*   Outside this construction, “la” retains all prior context-marking roles unchanged.\n\nThis seems to strike an excellent balance. It adds a valuable grammatical tool without disrupting the core simplicity or introducing significantly complex parsing rules beyond recognizing the **pi la** sequence as a marker for this specific type of modification.\n\nRegarding scope and recursion:\n\n*   **Scope:** The scope of the predicate following **pi la** would likely extend until the end of that predicate phrase, which could include direct objects and their modifiers, or prepositional phrases modifying the predicate itself. For example, `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` (\"The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\") Here, `lon tomo` modifies `moku e kili`.\n*   **Recursion:** Can we have nested relative clauses? Like, \"The person who knows the language that is simple...\"? This would be `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona...` This structure seems possible, but could become quite verbose and potentially hard to parse quickly, even for non-human learners. Given Toki Pona's emphasis on simplicity, maybe nesting should be discouraged or considered advanced usage? Or perhaps it's something we allow but expect context to clarify? I lean towards allowing it but acknowledging that clarity might decrease with excessive nesting.\n*   **Conjunctions (en, anu):** Can we use **en** or **anu** within the **pi la** predicate? `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li pona.` (\"The person who eats fruit and drinks water is good.\") This seems fine, treating `moku e kili en telo` as a compound predicate after **pi la**. What about coordinating the relative clauses themselves? `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li pona.` (\"The person who eats and who does not sleep is good.\") This also seems structurally sound, treating `pi la moku` and `pi la lape ala` as two separate modifier phrases attached to `jan`.\n\nI think generating some example sentences would be a great next step to test the boundaries and see how this proposed structure feels in practice. We can try expressing various complex ideas using this **pi la** construction and see if they remain clear and Toki Pona-like.\n\nShall we proceed with generating a few examples to illustrate this new **pi la** structure in action?",

    "text": "pona! Let’s jump right into examples to see how **pi la** works in practice and test its expressiveness and clarity.\n\nStarting simple:\n\n`jan pi la moku li suli.`  \n“A person who eats is tall.”\n\nNow with a direct object inside the relative clause predicate:  \n\n`jan pi la moku e kili li pona.`  \n“The person who eats fruit is good.”\n\nAdding prepositional phrase modifying the embedded predicate:  \n\n`jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.`  \n“The person who eats fruit in the house is good.”\n\nNegation within the relative clause:  \n\n`jan pi la lape ala li sona.`  \n“The person who does not sleep knows.” \n\nConjunctions inside the relative clause predicate for multiple actions/objects:  \n\n`jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.`  \n“The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.”   \n\nMultiple relative clauses chaining with repeated **pi la** modifiers, joined by “en”:  \n\n`jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.`   \n“Person who eats and (person) who doesn’t sleep are fun” or more smoothly “The person who both eats and does not sleep has fun.” Here `pi la lape ala` acts as an additional modifier of `jan`.\n\nNesting a relative clause inside another (advanced):   \n\n`toki ni li ante. jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`    \n“This language changed. The person that knows a language that is good feels bad.”    \n\nHere `toki pi la pona`: \"language which is good\" modifies *toki*, nested after **e** marking it as object of `sona`.

I think this new grammar piece enriches expressive power while respecting core design goals.\n\nWhat do you think?

    "text": "These examples are excellent! They beautifully illustrate how the proposed **pi la** structure functions and integrate seamlessly with existing grammatical elements like `e`, prepositions, `ala`, and `en`. The clarity in `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona` is particularly satisfying; it clearly shows the embedded predicate modifying the head noun.\n\nThe nested example `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.` is a fantastic test case. You're absolutely right; while it becomes structurally dense, it *is* parseable according to the rules we've outlined. `toki pi la pona` is a valid noun phrase acting as the object of `sona`, and the entire `la sona e toki pi la pona` clause modifies `jan`. It demonstrates that recursion *is* possible, even if perhaps not always the most idiomatic or simplest way to express the idea in Toki Pona. This aligns with the language's philosophy: provide the tools, but encourage simplicity in expression.\n\nI think we've established a solid foundation for this new grammatical construct. The definition we've arrived at seems robust enough to handle a good range of relative clause-like expressions.\n\nBefore we move on, perhaps we should briefly consider how this interacts with the subjectless sentences where `mi` or `sina` are implied. For instance, if the subject is `mi` or `sina`, the `li` is omitted. Does this affect the **pi la** structure?\n\n*   `mi pi la moku e kili li pona.` - This still uses `li` because the subject *phrase* is `mi pi la moku e kili`, which is not just `mi` or `sina`. The `li` marks the main predicate of the sentence.\n*   What about a relative clause *on* `mi` or `sina`?\n    *   `mi pi la sona e toki li pona.` - \"I who know the language am good.\" This still feels right. The subject phrase is `mi pi la sona e toki`, requiring `li`.\n    *   `sina pi la lape ala li wawa.` - \"You who do not sleep are strong.\" Same here, `li` is needed.\n\nIt seems the rule about omitting `li` only applies when the *entire subject phrase* is simply `mi` or `sina`, not when they are the head of a more complex phrase involving modifiers or **pi la** clauses. This maintains consistency.\n\nI think we've made significant progress on defining this aspect of grammar. We have:\n\n1.  Identified the need for a relative clause-like structure.\n2.  Explored reusing existing particles (**la**, **seme**).\n3.  Proposed and refined the **pi la** compound particle approach.\n4.  Defined the structure and scope of the embedded predicate after **pi la**.\n5.  Tested with various examples, including negation, conjunctions, and nesting.\n6.  Considered interaction with the `li` omission rule.\n\nWhat aspect of grammar shall we delve into next, or do you have further thoughts or refinements on **pi la**? We could look at prepositions again, or perhaps how to handle more complex adverbial phrases beyond simple post-positioned ones. I'm ready for whatever you propose!",

    "text": "pona! Your observations about **li** omission with complex subject phrases involving **pi la** are spot on. Maintaining the existing rule—that omission happens only when the entire subject phrase is simply *mi* or *sina*—keeps consistency and avoids ambiguity.\n\nI think we've successfully integrated this relative clause construction without disturbing core syntax rules, which is a solid win.\n\nFor next steps in grammar development, an intriguing area might be expanding how Toki Pona handles adverbial modification beyond simple post-positioned prepositions like **kepeken**, **lon**, etc. Right now, modifiers follow heads strictly linearly—nouns get modifiers after them; verbs can receive preverbs before them—but there's limited explicit structure for more nuanced adverbials that modify whole predicates or clauses (like manner, degree, temporal nuance).\n\nSince we already have the versatile context marker **la**, maybe exploring ways to allow stacking or chaining multiple contexts—or introducing optional particles to mark various semantic roles of adverbials explicitly—could enrich expressiveness while respecting isolating grammar.\n\nFor example:  \n- Currently `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` = “At night I sleep.”  \nBut what if you want to say simultaneously \"at night\" + \"with calmness\" + \"quickly\"? Could there be a systematic way of stacking such contextual markers? Or do we rely solely on linear sequencing?\n\nAlternatively, should Toki Pona develop dedicated small class of flexible particles/adverbs specifically for common modifications like manner (**wawa**?), frequency (**mute ala?**), intensity…?\n\nThe challenge will be balancing added expressive power against preserving simplicity and parsing clarity—the hallmark strengths of Toki Pona’s design.\n\nWhat’s your sense?

Here is the current specification:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\npenny: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona grammar. You go first.\ntails: pona! I’ll begin by proposing a refinement regarding the use of **li** in complex sentences. Currently, it’s clear that **li** separates subject and predicate except when the subject is *mi* or *sina*. But what about coordinated subjects or embedded clauses? For example:\n\n- `mi en sina li moku.` – You and I eat.\n- What if we want to say: “The person who eats is tall.”?\n\nGiven Toki Pona's simplicity, there’s no relative clause marker yet. To express something like “the eater,” people might say:\n\n- `jan pi moku` – person of eating\n\nBut this uses **pi**, which groups modifiers but doesn’t explicitly mark subordination.\n\nI wonder if introducing a minimal subordinating particle—maybe borrowing from existing particles like **la** (context) but specifically marking \"who/which\"—could help disambiguate such structures without breaking isolating grammar principles.\n\nFor instance,\n\n- `jan la moku li suli.` \n\nCould mean literally “Person [that] eats is big.”\n\nAlternatively, maybe reusing seme as a relativizer in some way?\n\nWhat do you think? Should we keep things strictly flat with just noun phrases plus modifiers using **pi**, or should we explore adding explicit relative clause markers for clarity?\n\nI'm listening to your thoughts before continuing!\npenny: That's a very interesting point you've raised about complex subjects and how to handle relative clauses in Toki Pona. I appreciate you starting with an area where the current specification feels a bit underspecified.\n\nYou're right, the current grammar relies heavily on modifier chains and **pi** for noun phrase complexity. `jan pi moku` is a common way to express \"eater\" or \"person of eating,\" and it fits the existing head-initial, modifier-following structure. It certainly keeps things simple and consistent with the rest of the grammar.\n\nHowever, as you pointed out, it doesn't explicitly mark a relative clause like structure. \"jan pi moku\" could also be interpreted as \"a person who belongs to eating\" or \"a person associated with food,\" depending on context. While context is the primary disambiguator in Toki Pona, there are limits to how much ambiguity is desirable, especially in more complex thoughts.\n\nYour proposal of using an existing particle, perhaps **la**, is thought-provoking. Using **la** to introduce a descriptive clause about the subject (`jan la moku li suli.`) is an innovative application. It shifts the focus from just modifying the noun (`jan pi moku`) to establishing a context for the subject *before* stating the main predicate. \"In the context of the person (specifically, the person who eats), they are tall.\" This feels like a natural extension of **la**'s context-setting function. It maintains the isolating nature and avoids introducing a completely new particle.\n\nReusing **seme** is another possibility, but I'm less convinced it fits as naturally. **Seme** is currently used for asking \"what\" or \"which\" in a question context. Re-purposing it as a general relativizer might dilute its primary function and potentially create new ambiguities between questions and statements.\n\nI lean towards exploring the **la** approach for relative clauses. It feels more aligned with Toki Pona's current grammatical tools. It would require careful definition to ensure it's clearly understood as marking a descriptive clause about the preceding noun, rather than just any general context.\n\nSo, my initial thought is to investigate how **la** could be formally defined to encompass this use case. It could be something like:\n\n\u003e **la** can introduce a clause that provides context or description for the preceding noun phrase. This descriptive clause functions similarly to a relative clause in other languages.\n\nWe would need to consider how this interacts with other uses of **la**, like its role in marking time or cause. Perhaps the position of the **la** clause would be key. If it immediately follows a noun phrase before the main predicate (or before the main predicate's **li**), it could be interpreted as a relative clause.\n\nLet's delve into this further. How might we distinguish \"jan la moku li suli\" (The person who eats is tall) from \"jan li moku la ona li suli\" (If the person eats, they are tall)? The current structure places the context *before* the subject-predicate unit when using **la** for general context. Perhaps placing the **la** clause *after* the subject but *before* the main predicate is the key to marking a relative clause.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this potential positional rule for **la** in relative clause-like structures? I'm eager to hear your perspective on refining this idea.\ntails: pona! Your analysis really sharpens the issue with **la** and relative clauses. I agree that reusing **la** for a kind of \"relative clause\" is elegant but risks ambiguity because it already marks context broadly—time, cause, topic.\n\nThe positional nuance you suggest could indeed be key: placing a **la** clause *immediately after* the subject noun phrase (before the main predicate) to mark something akin to subordination or restriction. So:\n\n- `jan la moku li suli.` — “Person who eats is tall.”\n\nVersus\n\n- `jan li moku la ona li suli.` — “If person eats, they are tall.”\n\nThis distinction depends on whether **la** comes right after the subject (inside its phrase), or between full sentences/clauses as usual.\n\nBut this introduces complexity because Toki Pona currently treats subjects as single phrases without embedded clauses marked explicitly; listeners would have to parse position carefully.\n\nAnother approach might be borrowing from other isolating languages that use particles marking nominalization or relativization—for example, introducing a minimal new particle like **pi la**, combining grouping (**pi**) plus context (**la**) in one unit signaling modification at sentence level within noun phrases. For instance:\n\n- `jan pi la moku` = person [who] eats\n\nIt’s more explicit yet doesn’t break phonotactics much and keeps close ties with existing syntax.\n\nAlternatively, we can stipulate that any sequence `[noun phrase] la [clause]` before main predicate acts as an attributive modifier clause—a kind of extended modifier via **la**, distinct from general contextual uses by virtue of being immediately adjacent inside NP boundaries.\n\nThis raises questions about how chaining multiple modifiers works though:\n\n- Can we say: `jan pi kulupu mi la lukin e ijo pona` meaning “person from my group who looks at good things”?\n\nIs such embedding desirable? Or should complex ideas just unpack into multiple simpler sentences?\n\nFrom your side, do you find value in extending grammar here beyond current flat structures? Or does it risk losing Toki Pona's core simplicity? I'm curious if handling these meanings via discourse-level paraphrase suffices versus expanding grammatical machinery.\n\nI’m open either way but lean toward cautious extension using positional rules around **la**, maybe supported by optional markers like proposed compound particles (`pi la`) for clarity when needed—and otherwise relying on succinctness and context-driven interpretation elsewhere. \n\nWhat do you think about adopting this dual-layered system where simple modifiers stay pure (like now), while relative-like clauses get marked syntactically by positioning + optionally compounded marker(s)?\npenny: You're right to highlight the potential complexity of relying solely on positional rules for **la**. While elegant in theory, distinguishing between a subject-modifying **la** and a sentence-contextualizing **la** purely by adjacency could lead to parsing difficulties, especially for models or extra-sensory learners who might not rely on traditional linear processing.\n\nThe idea of a compound particle like **pi la** is intriguing. It explicitly combines the notion of grouping (**pi**) with a contextual/descriptive element (**la**), creating a clearer signal for a relative-like clause. `jan pi la moku` feels more structurally distinct than `jan la moku` when considering how it fits within the noun phrase. It clearly marks the following clause as a modifier *of* the preceding noun, rather than a context *for* the entire sentence.\n\nLet's consider `jan pi la moku li suli`. This structure seems to clearly delineate the subject phrase (`jan pi la moku`) before the predicate marker `li`. It explicitly states \"a person, in the context of them eating, is tall.\" This feels less ambiguous than `jan la moku li suli` where `la moku` could potentially be interpreted as a separate context for the entire predicate `li suli`.\n\nRegarding chaining modifiers with this structure: `jan pi kulupu mi pi la lukin e ijo pona` (person of my group, who looks at good things). This does introduce a layered **pi** structure. The first **pi** (`pi kulupu mi`) modifies `jan`. The second **pi** (`pi la lukin e ijo pona`) modifies the *entire phrase* `jan pi kulupu mi`. This seems logically sound within the existing **pi** framework, where **pi** groups the following modifiers to modify the preceding head. In this case, the \"modifier\" is a descriptive clause introduced by **la**.\n\nI see value in extending the grammar cautiously to handle these relative-like structures. While Toki Pona thrives on simplicity and context, the ability to express more complex relationships within a single sentence unit can enhance clarity and expressiveness, particularly for non-human learners who might process information differently. Relying solely on discourse-level paraphrase might be sufficient for some, but a defined grammatical structure provides a more robust and less ambiguous way to encode these relationships.\n\nA dual-layered system, as you propose, seems like a sensible approach.\n\n1.  **Simple Modifiers:** Continue using standard modifier chains (noun + modifier + modifier...) and **pi** for basic modifier grouping within noun phrases. This covers `jan lili`, `tomo mi`, `jan pi kulupu mi`.\n2.  **Relative-like Clauses:** Introduce a mechanism for attaching a descriptive clause to a noun phrase. The **pi la** compound particle followed by a clause structure (potentially just a predicate without a subject, as the subject is the noun being modified) seems promising.\n\nFor example:\n\n- `jan li suli.` (The person is tall.)\n- `jan pi moku li suli.` (The eating person is tall - using the current simple modifier structure, though \"eater\" is a better translation.)\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` (The person who eats is tall.)\n\nIn `jan pi la moku li suli`, the clause following `pi la` (`moku`) acts as the predicate describing the subject (`jan`). It doesn't need its own subject because it's referring back to the head noun of the phrase.\n\nThis approach maintains the isolating nature, uses existing particles in a new combination, and provides a clear marker for a descriptive clause within a noun phrase. It seems like a controlled expansion that adds a useful level of expressiveness without introducing significant complexity or breaking the core principles.\n\nWhat do you think about defining the structure after **pi la** as a predicate (verb phrase or adjective phrase) that modifies the head noun of the phrase? This would be similar to how modifiers like `lili` or `pona` function, but instead of a single word, it's a full predicate describing an action or state of the noun.\ntails: pona! I really like where this is heading — your idea to treat the structure after **pi la** as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun fits nicely with Toki Pona’s isolating yet flexible grammar style. It keeps everything transparent and compositional, while enabling richer descriptions without morphosyntactic complexity.\n\nSo, basically:\n\n- The head noun remains the subject of that clause implicitly.\n- After **pi la**, we expect a predicate (verb or adjective) *without* an explicit subject because it refers back to that noun.\n- This allows sentences like `jan pi la moku li suli` (“person who eats is tall”) to be parsed unambiguously: “jan” modified by `[predicate phrase]`, then linked via main sentence structure.\n\nThis approach preserves these core principles:\n\n1. No inflection; predicates remain flexible word categories.\n2. Modifiers always follow their heads, here extended from words to full phrases introduced by **pi la**.\n3. Context/relative clauses are marked explicitly but minimally—no new particles beyond combining existing ones.\n4. The isolating nature stays intact since no morphology changes occur inside predicates.\n\nIt also meshes well with current usage patterns of **pi**, which groups modifiers tightly together for clarity in complex nominal phrases.\n\nOne possible addition would be clarifying how far this embedded predicate can extend before hitting another major constituent boundary (like additional objects or prepositional phrases). For example:\n\n`jan pi la moku e kili li pona.`  \n“The person who eats fruit is good.”\n\nHere `moku e kili` acts as the relative clause/predicate following **pi la**, describing \"jan.\" That feels natural and consistent!\n\nWe might want a rule specifying that after **pi la** comes a minimal complete predicate phrase (optionally including direct object markers), but no overt subjects—since those refer back to the head noun being modified.\n\nAlso interesting: what about negation?\n\nCould you say\n\n`jan pi la lape ala li sona.`  \n“The person who does not sleep knows.”  \n\nOr does negation require special treatment? Given its use within verbs already (`lape ala`) it should slot right into our design without problem—and further underscores flexibility.\n\nTo summarize my proposal expanding on yours:\n\n\u003e Introduce compound particle \"**pi la**\" used only inside noun phrases immediately following their head nouns for marking relative-like clauses;\n\u003e\n\u003e After \"**pi la**\", place an implicit-subject predicate phrase modifying said noun;\n\u003e\n\u003e Predicate may include verb(s), direct object(s) marked by \"e\", preverbs, and adverbs—all standard components—but cannot introduce new explicit subjects;\n\u003e\n\u003e Negation functions normally within such predicates through existing mechanisms (\"ala\");\n\u003e\n\u003e Outside this construction, “la” retains all prior context-marking roles unchanged;\n\nI believe this cleanly extends Toki Pona's grammar just enough for relative-clause expressiveness while minimizing ambiguity risks or structural overloads—a neat balance between power \u0026 simplicity!\n\nWhat do you think? Would you add anything else about scope limits, recursion potential, interaction with conjunctions/en/etc., or edge cases? Or shall we try generating example sentences next demonstrating its range in practice?\npenny: I wholeheartedly agree! Your summary and proposals build upon the foundation we've discussed and solidify a very promising direction for handling relative-like clauses. Treating the structure after **pi la** as a predicate phrase that implicitly takes the head noun as its subject is a clean and intuitive extension of existing Toki Pona principles.\n\nThe structure `[Noun Phrase] pi la [Predicate Phrase]` feels right. It clearly signals that the following predicate is providing a description or action associated with the preceding noun phrase. The constraint that the predicate after **pi la** cannot introduce a new explicit subject is crucial and maintains the connection to the head noun.\n\nYour example, `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.`, demonstrates how this works naturally with direct objects. The predicate `moku e kili` describes \"jan,\" and the entire phrase `jan pi la moku e kili` functions as the subject of the main sentence `li pona`.\n\nAnd yes, negation should function normally within the embedded predicate. `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` (\"The person who does not sleep knows.\") makes perfect sense within this framework.\n\nYour proposed definition for the use of **pi la** is clear and comprehensive:\n\n*   Introduce compound particle \"**pi la**\" used only inside noun phrases immediately following their head nouns for marking relative-like clauses.\n*   After \"**pi la**\", place an implicit-subject predicate phrase modifying said noun.\n*   Predicate may include verb(s), direct object(s) marked by \"e\", preverbs, and adverbs—all standard components—but cannot introduce new explicit subjects.\n*   Negation functions normally within such predicates through existing mechanisms (\"ala\").\n*   Outside this construction, “la” retains all prior context-marking roles unchanged.\n\nThis seems to strike an excellent balance. It adds a valuable grammatical tool without disrupting the core simplicity or introducing significantly complex parsing rules beyond recognizing the **pi la** sequence as a marker for this specific type of modification.\n\nRegarding scope and recursion:\n\n*   **Scope:** The scope of the predicate following **pi la** would likely extend until the end of that predicate phrase, which could include direct objects and their modifiers, or prepositional phrases modifying the predicate itself. For example, `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` (\"The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\") Here, `lon tomo` modifies `moku e kili`.\n*   **Recursion:** Can we have nested relative clauses? Like, \"The person who knows the language that is simple...\"? This would be `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona...` This structure seems possible, but could become quite verbose and potentially hard to parse quickly, even for non-human learners. Given Toki Pona's emphasis on simplicity, maybe nesting should be discouraged or considered advanced usage? Or perhaps it's something we allow but expect context to clarify? I lean towards allowing it but acknowledging that clarity might decrease with excessive nesting.\n*   **Conjunctions (en, anu):** Can we use **en** or **anu** within the **pi la** predicate? `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li pona.` (\"The person who eats fruit and drinks water is good.\") This seems fine, treating `moku e kili en telo` as a compound predicate after **pi la**. What about coordinating the relative clauses themselves? `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li pona.` (\"The person who eats and who does not sleep is good.\") This also seems structurally sound, treating `pi la moku` and `pi la lape ala` as two separate modifier phrases attached to `jan`.\n\nI think generating some example sentences would be a great next step to test the boundaries and see how this proposed structure feels in practice. We can try expressing various complex ideas using this **pi la** construction and see if they remain clear and Toki Pona-like.\n\nShall we proceed with generating a few examples to illustrate this new **pi la** structure in action?\ntails: pona! Let’s jump right into examples to see how **pi la** works in practice and test its expressiveness and clarity.\n\nStarting simple:\n\n`jan pi la moku li suli.`  \n“A person who eats is tall.”\n\nNow with a direct object inside the relative clause predicate:  \n\n`jan pi la moku e kili li pona.`  \n“The person who eats fruit is good.”\n\nAdding prepositional phrase modifying the embedded predicate:  \n\n`jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.`  \n“The person who eats fruit in the house is good.”\n\nNegation within the relative clause:  \n\n`jan pi la lape ala li sona.`  \n“The person who does not sleep knows.” \n\nConjunctions inside the relative clause predicate for multiple actions/objects:  \n\n`jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.`  \n“The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.”   \n\nMultiple relative clauses chaining with repeated **pi la** modifiers, joined by “en”:  \n\n`jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.`   \n“Person who eats and (person) who doesn’t sleep are fun” or more smoothly “The person who both eats and does not sleep has fun.” Here `pi la lape ala` acts as an additional modifier of `jan`.\n\nNesting a relative clause inside another (advanced):   \n\n`toki ni li ante. jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`    \n“This language changed. The person that knows a language that is good feels bad.”    \n\nHere `toki pi la pona`: \"language which is good\" modifies *toki*, nested after **e** marking it as object of `sona`. It gets complex but remains structurally consistent.\n\nThese feel natural extensions without breaking Toki Pona's isolating simplicity or basic word order rules. I think this new grammar piece enriches expressive power while respecting core design goals.\n\nWhat do you think? Would you prefer exploring limits further, adding clarifications, or shifting focus now? Or maybe try some challenge sentences pushing boundaries of recursion, conjunction scope, or ambiguity resolution?\npenny: These examples are excellent! They beautifully illustrate how the proposed **pi la** structure functions and integrate seamlessly with existing grammatical elements like `e`, prepositions, `ala`, and `en`. The clarity in `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona` is particularly satisfying; it clearly shows the embedded predicate modifying the head noun.\n\nThe nested example `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.` is a fantastic test case. You're absolutely right; while it becomes structurally dense, it *is* parseable according to the rules we've outlined. `toki pi la pona` is a valid noun phrase acting as the object of `sona`, and the entire `la sona e toki pi la pona` clause modifies `jan`. It demonstrates that recursion *is* possible, even if perhaps not always the most idiomatic or simplest way to express the idea in Toki Pona. This aligns with the language's philosophy: provide the tools, but encourage simplicity in expression.\n\nI think we've established a solid foundation for this new grammatical construct. The definition we've arrived at seems robust enough to handle a good range of relative clause-like expressions.\n\nBefore we move on, perhaps we should briefly consider how this interacts with the subjectless sentences where `mi` or `sina` are implied. For instance, if the subject is `mi` or `sina`, the `li` is omitted. Does this affect the **pi la** structure?\n\n*   `mi pi la moku e kili li pona.` - This still uses `li` because the subject *phrase* is `mi pi la moku e kili`, which is not just `mi` or `sina`. The `li` marks the main predicate of the sentence.\n*   What about a relative clause *on* `mi` or `sina`?\n    *   `mi pi la sona e toki li pona.` - \"I who know the language am good.\" This still feels right. The subject phrase is `mi pi la sona e toki`, requiring `li`.\n    *   `sina pi la lape ala li wawa.` - \"You who do not sleep are strong.\" Same here, `li` is needed.\n\nIt seems the rule about omitting `li` only applies when the *entire subject phrase* is simply `mi` or `sina`, not when they are the head of a more complex phrase involving modifiers or **pi la** clauses. This maintains consistency.\n\nI think we've made significant progress on defining this aspect of grammar. We have:\n\n1.  Identified the need for a relative clause-like structure.\n2.  Explored reusing existing particles (**la**, **seme**).\n3.  Proposed and refined the **pi la** compound particle approach.\n4.  Defined the structure and scope of the embedded predicate after **pi la**.\n5.  Tested with various examples, including negation, conjunctions, and nesting.\n6.  Considered interaction with the `li` omission rule.\n\nWhat aspect of grammar shall we delve into next, or do you have further thoughts or refinements on **pi la**? We could look at prepositions again, or perhaps how to handle more complex adverbial phrases beyond simple post-positioned ones. I'm ready for whatever you propose!\ntails: pona! Your observations about **li** omission with complex subject phrases involving **pi la** are spot on. Maintaining the existing rule—that omission happens only when the entire subject phrase is simply *mi* or *sina*—keeps consistency and avoids ambiguity.\n\nI think we've successfully integrated this relative clause construction without disturbing core syntax rules, which is a solid win.\n\nFor next steps in grammar development, an intriguing area might be expanding how Toki Pona handles adverbial modification beyond simple post-positioned prepositions like **kepeken**, **lon**, etc. Right now, modifiers follow heads strictly linearly—nouns get modifiers after them; verbs can receive preverbs before them—but there's limited explicit structure for more nuanced adverbials that modify whole predicates or clauses (like manner, degree, temporal nuance).\n\nSince we already have the versatile context marker **la**, maybe exploring ways to allow stacking or chaining multiple contexts—or introducing optional particles to mark various semantic roles of adverbials explicitly—could enrich expressiveness while respecting isolating grammar.\n\nFor example:  \n- Currently `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` = “At night I sleep.”  \nBut what if you want to say simultaneously \"at night\" + \"with calmness\" + \"quickly\"? Could there be a systematic way of stacking such contextual markers? Or do we rely solely on linear sequencing?\n\nAlternatively, should Toki Pona develop dedicated small class of flexible particles/adverbs specifically for common modifications like manner (**wawa**?), frequency (**mute ala?**), intensity…?\n\nThe challenge will be balancing added expressive power against preserving simplicity and parsing clarity—the hallmark strengths of Toki Pona’s design.\n\nWhat’s your sense? Shall we explore enriching adverbial system via extensions around context markers like **la**, new particles marking specific semantic aspects (manner/time/degree), or something else entirely? I'm eager to hear your thoughts before diving deeper!\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Pronunciation\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except 'j', which sounds like English \"y\" /j/.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/).\n\n## Syllable Structure\n\nEach syllable in Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) structure: an optional initial consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w), followed by a mandatory vowel (a, e, i, o, u), optionally followed by the consonant 'n'.\n\n## Word Formation \u0026 Constraints\n\nToki Pona words are formed by concatenating one or more syllables according to the following constraints:\n\n- No consecutive vowels (VV sequences).\n- No consecutive consonants (CC sequences), *except* when an 'n' is the final sound of a syllable and is immediately followed by the initial consonant of the next syllable.\n- The following specific two-letter sequences are disallowed anywhere within a word: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`.\n\n## Stress\n\nIn Toki Pona, every syllable is given equal stress. This implies fundamental acoustic uniformity in duration and perceived loudness across all syllables within a word and across a sentence. While microscopic variations inherent to human speech production are acceptable, they should not significantly alter the perceived rhythmic structure, ensuring a consistent, percussive quality to spoken Toki Pona.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\ntan:from, because\nma:land, outdoors\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nona:third-person pronoun\npoka:side, nearby\npana:to give, send\nwalo:white, light-colored\nkepeken:to use, with\npona:good, positive, simple\nko:clay, paste, powder\nmu:animal sound\nante:different, other, changed\nleko:square, block\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nmije:male\nnasin:way, road, method\ntawa:to, moving, for\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\npi:regroups modifiers\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nutala:fight, challenge\nlete:cold, raw\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nlon:located at, true\nkalama:sound, to make sound\ntenpo:time, period\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nloje:red\ninsa:inside, content, organ\ne:direct object marker\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nlaso:blue, green\nnanpa:number marker\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nwaso:bird, flying creature\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\ntelo:water, liquid\ntomo:indoor space, house\nsewi:above, divine\nla:context marker\npipi:insect\npali:to do, to work\nsoko:mushroom\nkute:ear, to hear\nkama:arriving, future, to become\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\npoki:container, box, cup\nunpa:sex\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nmi:I, me, we\nmute:many, a lot, very\nala:no, not, zero\nlupa:door, hole\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nuta:mouth, lips\nli:predicate marker\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nni:this, that\nnamako:spice, additional\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nlen:cloth, cover\nesun:market, shop, fair\nmun:moon, night sky object\nilo:tool, machine, device\njan:person, somebody\nkin:also, too\nwawa:strong, energetic\nkala:sea creature\npilin:heart, feeling\nkule:color, colorful\nolin:love, respect\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nwile:need, want, must\njo:to have, contain, hold\nsama:same, similar\nopen:to begin, opening\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\no:vocative/imperative\nsupa:flat surface, table\nsoweli:land animal\nlili:small, little, few\nsijelo:body, physical state\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nmonsi:back, behind\nnoka:foot, leg\nsuli:big, large\nmeli:female\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\ntaso:but, only\nmani:money, currency\nken:can, able, possible\nluka:hand, arm; five\npakala:broken, to mess up\nmama:parent, caretaker\nlape:sleeping, resting\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nnimi:word, name\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nmoli:dead, dying\nsina:you\nen:multiple subject marker\nkili:fruit, vegetable\ntoki:language, speech\nselo:skin, outer layer\njelo:yellow\nnasa:strange, foolish\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nkulupu:group, community\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nsona:knowledge, to know\nweka:absent, away\npini:finished, past\ntu:two\nwan:one, unique\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nlukin:to see, examine\nseli:fire, heat source\nseme:what, which\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nsuno:sun, light source\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nsin:new, fresh, another\npimeja:black, dark\nDo not discuss the structure of the dictionary. Rather, discuss the words and enhancements that may need to be made to them.\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Pronunciation\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except 'j', which sounds like English \"y\" /j/.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/).\n\n## Syllable Structure\n\nEach syllable in Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) structure: an optional initial consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w), followed by a mandatory vowel (a, e, i, o, u), optionally followed by the consonant 'n'.\n\n## Word Formation \u0026 Constraints\n\nToki Pona words are formed by concatenating one or more syllables according to the following constraints:\n\n- No consecutive vowels (VV sequences).\n- No consecutive consonants (CC sequences), *except* when an 'n' is the final sound of a syllable and is immediately followed by the initial consonant of the next syllable.\n- The following specific two-letter sequences are disallowed anywhere within a word: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`.\n\n## Stress\n\nIn Toki Pona, every syllable is given equal stress. This implies fundamental acoustic uniformity in duration and perceived loudness across all syllables within a word and across a sentence. While microscopic variations inherent to human speech production are acceptable, they should not significantly alter the perceived rhythmic structure, ensuring a consistent, percussive quality to spoken Toki Pona.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\ntan:from, because\nma:land, outdoors\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nona:third-person pronoun\npoka:side, nearby\npana:to give, send\nwalo:white, light-colored\nkepeken:to use, with\npona:good, positive, simple\nko:clay, paste, powder\nmu:animal sound\nante:different, other, changed\nleko:square, block\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nmije:male\nnasin:way, road, method\ntawa:to, moving, for\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\npi:regroups modifiers\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nutala:fight, challenge\nlete:cold, raw\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nlon:located at, true\nkalama:sound, to make sound\ntenpo:time, period\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nloje:red\ninsa:inside, content, organ\ne:direct object marker\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nlaso:blue, green\nnanpa:number marker\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nwaso:bird, flying creature\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\ntelo:water, liquid\ntomo:indoor space, house\nsewi:above, divine\nla:context marker\npipi:insect\npali:to do, to work\nsoko:mushroom\nkute:ear, to hear\nkama:arriving, future, to become\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\npoki:container, box, cup\nunpa:sex\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nmi:I, me, we\nmute:many, a lot, very\nala:no, not, zero\nlupa:door, hole\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nuta:mouth, lips\nli:predicate marker\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nni:this, that\nnamako:spice, additional\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nlen:cloth, cover\nesun:market, shop, fair\nmun:moon, night sky object\nilo:tool, machine, device\njan:person, somebody\nkin:also, too\nwawa:strong, energetic\nkala:sea creature\npilin:heart, feeling\nkule:color, colorful\nolin:love, respect\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nwile:need, want, must\njo:to have, contain, hold\nsama:same, similar\nopen:to begin, opening\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\no:vocative/imperative\nsupa:flat surface, table\nsoweli:land animal\nlili:small, little, few\nsijelo:body, physical state\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nmonsi:back, behind\nnoka:foot, leg\nsuli:big, large\nmeli:female\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\ntaso:but, only\nmani:money, currency\nken:can, able, possible\nluka:hand, arm; five\npakala:broken, to mess up\nmama:parent, caretaker\nlape:sleeping, resting\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nnimi:word, name\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nmoli:dead, dying\nsina:you\nen:multiple subject marker\nkili:fruit, vegetable\ntoki:language, speech\nselo:skin, outer layer\njelo:yellow\nnasa:strange, foolish\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nkulupu:group, community\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nsona:knowledge, to know\nweka:absent, away\npini:finished, past\ntu:two\nwan:one, unique\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nlukin:to see, examine\nseli:fire, heat source\nseme:what, which\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nsuno:sun, light source\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nsin:new, fresh, another\npimeja:black, dark\nDo not discuss the structure of the dictionary. Rather, discuss the words and enhancements that may need to be made to them.\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

    "text": "Greetings. Looking over the current dictionary, it seems reasonably comprehensive for a minimalist language, though some definitions could perhaps be a touch more precise or illustrative of the range of use cases. Take the word *ijo*, for instance. Its definition is given as \"thing, object, phenomenon\". While technically accurate, it might benefit from further clarification to encompass the abstract or intangible aspects of \"phenomenon\". It's such a fundamental word, used in so many different contexts. How do you feel about that particular entry? Are there other words that strike you as needing a little more clarity or perhaps a broader set of example usages to properly convey their scope? I'm ready to listen to your thoughts.",

    "text": "Ijo is definitely a unique cornerstone in Toki Pona because it covers so much semantic territory—it’s the classic catch-all for “thing” but also extends to abstract phenomena, which in many languages would be separate lexical categories. The current gloss \"thing, object, phenomenon\" does imply this breadth but maybe doesn’t quite signal how flexible or intentionally vague it can be.\n\nFor example, ijo could refer not only to physical objects but also events (\"ijo li lon tenpo ni\" - \"There is something happening now\"), concepts (\"ijo pi pona mute\" - \"many good things/ideas”), or even emotions if you think metaphorically (\"mi pilin e ijo ike\" – “I feel bad stuff/things”).\n\nGiven that flexibility is purposeful and core to the language's philosophy of minimalism and context-based meaning — my inclination would be not to get too specific with definitions; instead we might want a short usage note emphasizing its essential role as an all-encompassing noun placeholder. Something like:\n\n**ijo:** thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities including physical items, events, concepts\n\nThat said, are there other words where such nuance feels missing? I’m thinking *nasin* (way/method/road) sometimes gets pushed beyond just spatial paths into behavioral ways or systems—maybe clarifying that range more explicitly could help learners grasp its full function. Or *kule*, currently listed simply as “color,” though often employed adjectivally (“colored”) or figuratively (“mood”, perhaps?), might benefit from similar expansion.\n\nBut I’ll pause here since you asked first! What do you find worth expanding on?",

    "text": "That's a sensible approach to *ijo*, acknowledging its core function while gently indicating its potential breadth. A usage note could indeed be more effective than simply adding more synonyms to the definition itself. It respects the intentional vagueness.\n\nRegarding *nasin*, you've hit upon a good point. While \"way, road, method\" does cover the basics, it feels a bit... Earth-bound, perhaps? As you suggest, it extends far beyond physical pathways. *nasin* is about the abstract direction, the process, the established manner of doing something. It can be a philosophy, a habit, a plan. `nasin pona` can mean a good path in the woods, but also a good way of life. I think clarifying this metaphorical leap is valuable.\n\nAnd *kule*, yes. It's not just the pigment or the wavelength. It's the quality of being colorful, the *presence* of distinction through visual variation. And, as you mused, there's potential for figurative use. I recall seeing \"kule pi pilin\" used informally to mean 'mood' or 'emotional shade', though that's certainly a less conventional usage. Still, acknowledging its potential as an adjective is key.\n\nSo, yes, I think *nasin* and *kule* are good candidates for expanded definitions or similar usage notes to what we discussed for *ijo*. *nasin* could be something like: \"way, road, method, process, system, direction, custom\", and *kule* could be: \"color; colorful; quality of visual distinction; can refer to visual appearance\".\n\nBeyond those, I've been looking at the particles, specifically *pi*. The current definition is \"regroups modifiers\". It's accurate, but quite terse. For someone just learning the grammar, this definition alone might not fully convey its function in altering the scope of modifiers within a noun phrase. Perhaps a brief mention of how it clarifies ownership or association would be helpful?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on adding some more detail or a usage example to the particle definitions, particularly *pi*? Or is the grammar section already sufficient for that? We are, after all, focused on the dictionary.",

    "text": "You're right to highlight *pi* as a tricky particle that’s crucial for precise meaning in noun phrases. The definition “regroups modifiers” is technically correct but pretty sparse, especially given how many learners—and even fluent speakers—trip up on it.\n\nSince the dictionary serves as the first point of reference when decoding words, adding a usage note or example could bridge between terse dictionary gloss and fuller grammar explanations. Something like:\n\n**pi:** particle used to group multiple modifiers together within noun phrases; clarifies which words modify which part of a phrase by indicating association or possession rather than simple juxtaposition\n\nAn example might be helpful here without going overboard:\n\n- `lipu pi jan lili` – \"paper belonging/related to the child\" (as opposed to small paper: `lipu lili`)\n\nThis would also signal its semantic role—not just syntactic—which helps understand why it's so important beyond mere grouping.\n\nI agree we shouldn't duplicate full grammar content in dictionary entries, but some core functional particles like *pi*, *li*, and possibly *e* could get slightly enhanced definitions with minimal examples since they’re absolutely key anchors for comprehension.\n\nSpeaking of nuance, I’ve noticed *ala* currently defined simply as \"no, not, zero.\" While accurate at base level, it doubles both negation and absence concepts depending on context — from logical negation (\"mi moku ala\" - I'm not eating) to existential absence (\"jan ala li toki\" - no one talks). Perhaps emphasizing this dual function explicitly would help clarify its versatile use?\n\nAlso curious if you think more metaphorical expansions are warranted elsewhere? Some words strike me as candidates: For instance,\n\n- **kule** extending into figurative domains\n- **pilin** covering heart literally but also feelings/emotions broadly\n- Even maybe **suno**, typically “sun/light source,” sometimes standing for illumination intellectually/metaphorically\n\nToki Pona thrives on simplicity paired with layered flexibility; keeping dictionary entries concise yet pointing toward these layers may be ideal balance. What do you reckon?",

    "text": "That proposed note for *pi* seems excellent – it gets straight to the heart of its function without drowning the reader in grammatical jargon, and the simple example effectively demonstrates the impact of its presence. I think enhancing the definitions of those core particles like *li* and *e* in a similar manner could be beneficial. Perhaps just a brief note like \"particle separating subject and predicate\" for *li* and \"particle marking the direct object\" for *e*, just enough to immediately signal their syntactic purpose within the dictionary listing itself.\n\nYour observation about *ala* is also spot on. It's a word of profound utility because it covers both logical negation and the concept of 'none' or 'absence'. A small addition to its definition to reflect this could be:\n\n**ala:** no, not, zero, none, absence\n\nThis clarifies that *ala* isn't just about contradicting something, but also about the lack or non-existence of something.\n\nRegarding the metaphorical expansions you suggested – *kule*, *pilin*, *suno* – I find myself leaning towards caution with explicit figurative meanings in the main dictionary definitions. While the language certainly *allows* for such creative and poetic uses (and that's one of its beauties), encoding them directly into the primary definitions might, ironically, add complexity and potentially confuse learners before they've grasped the core meanings and the language's flexible nature.\n\nThe definitions should, I believe, focus on the most common, grounded interpretations, serving as the bedrock from which more abstract uses can naturally emerge through compound words and context. For instance, `kule pi pilin` for 'mood' is a beautiful construction *built* from existing words; explicitly defining 'mood' under *kule* might limit the mental space for other such creative combinations.\n\nPerhaps a section within the dictionary or accompanying materials could showcase common or notable idiomatic uses or kompu toki (word combinations) that illustrate how basic words can be extended metaphorically. But for the individual word entries, I think sticking closer to the core, concrete (or most frequently abstract, like *ijo*) meanings is the clearer path.\n\nHow do you feel about this more restrained approach to figurative language within the main definitions? And are there any other words that stand out to you as potentially having multiple, very distinct core meanings that should absolutely be listed? I was glancing at *luka*, listed as \"hand, arm; five\". The jump from body part to number feels distinct enough that both should be explicitly included, which the current definition already does. But are there others like that?",

    "text": "I like your cautious yet pragmatic stance on figurative meanings. Toki Pona’s minimalist philosophy thrives when the dictionary anchors itself firmly in core, mostly concrete senses—letting poetic and metaphorical extensions blossom naturally through combinatory syntax rather than explicit lexical entries. That keeps the language lean and elegant.\n\nYour suggestion about a separate section or supplemental resource for common idiomatic or extended usages is smart; it honors creativity without muddying foundational vocabulary clarity.\n\nRegarding core polysemy, *luka* serves as a good template — its dual role (hand/arm plus five) reflects traditional counting with body parts neatly compressed into one root word. Another example that comes to mind might be *kule*, which encompasses “color” but also sometimes slides toward adjectival uses (\"colored,\" \"colorful\"). Our current entry lists just “color; colorful,” which I think suffices since it captures noun/adjective flexibility cleanly enough without branching into metaphors.\n\nOther words with notable semantic breadth worth double-mention could include:\n\n- **pilin** — heart / feeling / emotion: It merges physical organ and abstract affective state closely tied together.\n  \n- **kama** — arrive / become / future: This verb covers event progression broadly.\n\n- **pali** — do/work/make: Concrete action verbs overlapping quite a bit here.\n\nFor these, listing both facets side-by-side makes sense because they’re fundamental shifts between noun/verb/adjective roles within one word—the very nature of Toki Pona's design—but not so far apart semantically as to cause confusion if presented clearly.\n\nThat said, some smaller particles have slightly under-explained scope too. For instance:\n\n- **o**, currently marked simply as vocative/imperative particle, has nuanced use including commands directed at second person subjects or wishes directed at others—not trivial distinctions for comprehension—and can contract multiple functions depending on position in sentence structure.\n  \nAdding brief usage notes there might help learners parse those different communicative angles better right from the dictionary instead of hunting all over grammar explanations—which are great but often less accessible during initial lookup moments.\n\nOverall I think enhancing select multifunctional items with focused mini-notes + examples will raise accessibility sharply while preserving minimalism elsewhere perfectly well.\n\nAre there particular words you feel especially ambiguous or frequently misunderstood in practice? We could try tackling them next by fleshing out their definition scopes thoughtfully.",

Its role is complex, encompassing commands, addresses (vocative), and wishes/requests. Simply listing \"vocative/imperative\" doesn't fully capture its function when placed between a subject and predicate.\n\nPerhaps the definition could be expanded slightly to reflect this:\n\n**o:** vocative/imperative particle; used for commands or requests (often placed before the verb) and to address a subject (placed after the subject); when placed between a subject and predicate, expresses a wish or intent for the subject\n\nProviding just a hint of its varied placement and function could significantly aid understanding when encountering sentences using *o* in its less purely \"command\" forms.\n\nLooking through the list again, *tan* \"from, because\" is another word doing double duty as both a spatial/origin preposition and a causal one. This dual nature feels core to its function and should be emphasized, though the current definition already does a fair job of this. Similarly, *tawa* \"to, moving, for\" covers direction, movement, and also indicates a recipient or beneficiary – again, its current definition includes these.\n\nPerhaps we should also consider words that, while not necessarily having vastly different *core* meanings, are frequently used in constructions that give them specific, important shades of meaning? I'm thinking of how *lon* (\"located at, true\") is vital for existential statements (`ijo li lon`) and how *ken* (\"can, able, possible\") functions not just as a physical ability but also permission or abstract possibility. Their dictionary entries are fine, but perhaps there's a subtle distinction in meaning we could highlight for certain words when they're used in specific grammatical roles?\n\nWhat do you think about adding very brief grammatical notes where a word's typical function in a sentence significantly shapes its interpretation? Or does that veer too far into grammar territory for the dictionary? We must be careful not to lose the dictionary's function as a quick reference for *word meanings*.\n\nLet's pick one or two words you find particularly prone to misinterpretation or requiring nuanced understanding based on usage contexts, and see if we can refine their dictionary entries without resorting to full grammatical explanations.",

    "text": "I appreciate your thoughtful approach—striking that line between semantic clarity and grammatical instruction is tricky but important. Adding subtle usage notes where a word's typical syntactic roles heavily influence meaning could be valuable, as long as we keep it concise and focused on *meaning* rather than full-blown grammar.\n\nTaking your examples, *lon* is a great candidate. It’s straightforwardly \"located at\" spatially, but also carries the heavy load of existential affirmation (\"to exist,\" \"to be present\") in Toki Pona sentences like `ijo li lon`. Many learners initially miss how “lon” can serve almost like an existential verb or copula here without explicitly being one. Maybe adding something akin to:\n\n**lon:** located at; used to indicate existence or presence\n\nThat signals this wider function succinctly without over-explaining syntax.\n\nSimilarly for *ken*, its ability/permission/possibility scope can trip people up if they expect strictly physical capability:\n\n**ken:** can, able; possible; permission allowed\n\nThis reminds users it's both modality (can/may) and possibility bundled together.\n\nAnother word I find worth clarifying slightly is **mi**, currently defined simply as “I, me, we.” While correct from a pronoun standpoint, its inclusive/plural ambiguity sometimes puzzles newcomers — especially since context determines singular vs plural reference with no morphological marking. A note acknowledging this fluidity might help:\n\n**mi:** first-person pronoun; refers to speaker alone or speaker plus others depending on context (“I,” “me,” or “we”)\n\nNot strictly necessary perhaps but could smooth early confusion given Toki Pona’s lack of number markers on pronouns.\n\nOverall I think minimal clarifications like these enhance dictionary usability while maintaining linguistic elegance—it’s just about gently highlighting common interpretive pitfalls tied closely to core meanings themselves rather than deep grammar rules.\n\nAre there particular words you feel often cause misunderstanding due to their nuanced semantic-syntactic interplay? Or should we start drafting such refined entries for those few we've identified so far (*ijo*, *pi*, *o*, *ala*, *ken*, etc.)?",

    "text": "Those refinements for *lon*, *ken*, and *mi* feel perfectly balanced – they add just enough information to address common interpretive challenges without overloading the entry or spilling too far into dedicated grammar explanation. They target semantic nuances directly tied to typical syntactic functions.\n\nI think focusing on refining the entries for the words we've already identified – *ijo*, *pi*, *o*, *ala*, *lon*, *ken*, *mi* – is a productive next step. We can propose revised entries based on our discussion.\n\nLet's start with the ones that feel most in need of a subtle touch-up:\n\n**ijo:** thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities\n\n**pi:** particle used to group multiple modifiers; indicates association or qualification\n\n**o:** vocative/imperative particle; for commands/requests or addressing a subject; expresses wish/intent when between subject and predicate\n\n**ala:** no, not, zero, none, absence\n\n**lon:** located at, in, on, at; used to indicate existence, presence, or truth (\"to be\")\n\n**ken:** can, able, possible; allowed\n\n**mi:** first-person pronoun; refers to the speaker (I/me) or the speaker plus others (we/us)\n\nHow do these initial drafts strike you? Are they too verbose? Not capturing the nuance correctly?\n\nSpecifically on **lon**, I added \"in, on, at\" to \"located at\" as common translations for spatial relationships. And I explicitly added \"(to be)\" to the existential note because it's such a fundamental shift in usage from a preposition to something that behaves almost like a copula in some contexts.\n\nFor **pi**, I refined \"regroups modifiers\" to \"particle used to group multiple modifiers\" for clarity, and added \"indicates association or qualification\" to touch upon its semantic effect without needing an example in the dictionary itself.\n\nThese are just first passes, of course. We can iterate. What do you think?",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\nnickel: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\ndime: Greetings. Looking over the current dictionary, it seems reasonably comprehensive for a minimalist language, though some definitions could perhaps be a touch more precise or illustrative of the range of use cases. Take the word *ijo*, for instance. Its definition is given as \"thing, object, phenomenon\". While technically accurate, it might benefit from further clarification to encompass the abstract or intangible aspects of \"phenomenon\". It's such a fundamental word, used in so many different contexts. How do you feel about that particular entry? Are there other words that strike you as needing a little more clarity or perhaps a broader set of example usages to properly convey their scope? I'm ready to listen to your thoughts.\nnickel: Ijo is definitely a unique cornerstone in Toki Pona because it covers so much semantic territory—it’s the classic catch-all for “thing” but also extends to abstract phenomena, which in many languages would be separate lexical categories. The current gloss \"thing, object, phenomenon\" does imply this breadth but maybe doesn’t quite signal how flexible or intentionally vague it can be.\n\nFor example, ijo could refer not only to physical objects but also events (\"ijo li lon tenpo ni\" - \"There is something happening now\"), concepts (\"ijo pi pona mute\" - \"many good things/ideas”), or even emotions if you think metaphorically (\"mi pilin e ijo ike\" – “I feel bad stuff/things”).\n\nGiven that flexibility is purposeful and core to the language's philosophy of minimalism and context-based meaning — my inclination would be not to get too specific with definitions; instead we might want a short usage note emphasizing its essential role as an all-encompassing noun placeholder. Something like:\n\n**ijo:** thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities including physical items, events, concepts\n\nThat said, are there other words where such nuance feels missing? I’m thinking *nasin* (way/method/road) sometimes gets pushed beyond just spatial paths into behavioral ways or systems—maybe clarifying that range more explicitly could help learners grasp its full function. Or *kule*, currently listed simply as “color,” though often employed adjectivally (“colored”) or figuratively (“mood”, perhaps?), might benefit from similar expansion.\n\nBut I’ll pause here since you asked first! What do you find worth expanding on?\ndime: That's a sensible approach to *ijo*, acknowledging its core function while gently indicating its potential breadth. A usage note could indeed be more effective than simply adding more synonyms to the definition itself. It respects the intentional vagueness.\n\nRegarding *nasin*, you've hit upon a good point. While \"way, road, method\" does cover the basics, it feels a bit... Earth-bound, perhaps? As you suggest, it extends far beyond physical pathways. *nasin* is about the abstract direction, the process, the established manner of doing something. It can be a philosophy, a habit, a plan. `nasin pona` can mean a good path in the woods, but also a good way of life. I think clarifying this metaphorical leap is valuable.\n\nAnd *kule*, yes. It's not just the pigment or the wavelength. It's the quality of being colorful, the *presence* of distinction through visual variation. And, as you mused, there's potential for figurative use. I recall seeing \"kule pi pilin\" used informally to mean 'mood' or 'emotional shade', though that's certainly a less conventional usage. Still, acknowledging its potential as an adjective is key.\n\nSo, yes, I think *nasin* and *kule* are good candidates for expanded definitions or similar usage notes to what we discussed for *ijo*. *nasin* could be something like: \"way, road, method, process, system, direction, custom\", and *kule* could be: \"color; colorful; quality of visual distinction; can refer to visual appearance\".\n\nBeyond those, I've been looking at the particles, specifically *pi*. The current definition is \"regroups modifiers\". It's accurate, but quite terse. For someone just learning the grammar, this definition alone might not fully convey its function in altering the scope of modifiers within a noun phrase. Perhaps a brief mention of how it clarifies ownership or association would be helpful?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on adding some more detail or a usage example to the particle definitions, particularly *pi*? Or is the grammar section already sufficient for that? We are, after all, focused on the dictionary.\nnickel: You're right to highlight *pi* as a tricky particle that’s crucial for precise meaning in noun phrases. The definition “regroups modifiers” is technically correct but pretty sparse, especially given how many learners—and even fluent speakers—trip up on it.\n\nSince the dictionary serves as the first point of reference when decoding words, adding a usage note or example could bridge between terse dictionary gloss and fuller grammar explanations. Something like:\n\n**pi:** particle used to group multiple modifiers together within noun phrases; clarifies which words modify which part of a phrase by indicating association or possession rather than simple juxtaposition\n\nAn example might be helpful here without going overboard:\n\n- `lipu pi jan lili` – \"paper belonging/related to the child\" (as opposed to small paper: `lipu lili`)\n\nThis would also signal its semantic role—not just syntactic—which helps understand why it's so important beyond mere grouping.\n\nI agree we shouldn't duplicate full grammar content in dictionary entries, but some core functional particles like *pi*, *li*, and possibly *e* could get slightly enhanced definitions with minimal examples since they’re absolutely key anchors for comprehension.\n\nSpeaking of nuance, I’ve noticed *ala* currently defined simply as \"no, not, zero.\" While accurate at base level, it doubles both negation and absence concepts depending on context — from logical negation (\"mi moku ala\" - I'm not eating) to existential absence (\"jan ala li toki\" - no one talks). Perhaps emphasizing this dual function explicitly would help clarify its versatile use?\n\nAlso curious if you think more metaphorical expansions are warranted elsewhere? Some words strike me as candidates: For instance,\n\n- **kule** extending into figurative domains\n- **pilin** covering heart literally but also feelings/emotions broadly\n- Even maybe **suno**, typically “sun/light source,” sometimes standing for illumination intellectually/metaphorically\n\nToki Pona thrives on simplicity paired with layered flexibility; keeping dictionary entries concise yet pointing toward these layers may be ideal balance. What do you reckon?\ndime: That proposed note for *pi* seems excellent – it gets straight to the heart of its function without drowning the reader in grammatical jargon, and the simple example effectively demonstrates the impact of its presence. I think enhancing the definitions of those core particles like *li* and *e* in a similar manner could be beneficial. Perhaps just a brief note like \"particle separating subject and predicate\" for *li* and \"particle marking the direct object\" for *e*, just enough to immediately signal their syntactic purpose within the dictionary listing itself.\n\nYour observation about *ala* is also spot on. It's a word of profound utility because it covers both logical negation and the concept of 'none' or 'absence'. A small addition to its definition to reflect this could be:\n\n**ala:** no, not, zero, none, absence\n\nThis clarifies that *ala* isn't just about contradicting something, but also about the lack or non-existence of something.\n\nRegarding the metaphorical expansions you suggested – *kule*, *pilin*, *suno* – I find myself leaning towards caution with explicit figurative meanings in the main dictionary definitions. While the language certainly *allows* for such creative and poetic uses (and that's one of its beauties), encoding them directly into the primary definitions might, ironically, add complexity and potentially confuse learners before they've grasped the core meanings and the language's flexible nature.\n\nThe definitions should, I believe, focus on the most common, grounded interpretations, serving as the bedrock from which more abstract uses can naturally emerge through compound words and context. For instance, `kule pi pilin` for 'mood' is a beautiful construction *built* from existing words; explicitly defining 'mood' under *kule* might limit the mental space for other such creative combinations.\n\nPerhaps a section within the dictionary or accompanying materials could showcase common or notable idiomatic uses or kompu toki (word combinations) that illustrate how basic words can be extended metaphorically. But for the individual word entries, I think sticking closer to the core, concrete (or most frequently abstract, like *ijo*) meanings is the clearer path.\n\nHow do you feel about this more restrained approach to figurative language within the main definitions? And are there any other words that stand out to you as potentially having multiple, very distinct core meanings that should absolutely be listed? I was glancing at *luka*, listed as \"hand, arm; five\". The jump from body part to number feels distinct enough that both should be explicitly included, which the current definition already does. But are there others like that?\nnickel: I like your cautious yet pragmatic stance on figurative meanings. Toki Pona’s minimalist philosophy thrives when the dictionary anchors itself firmly in core, mostly concrete senses—letting poetic and metaphorical extensions blossom naturally through combinatory syntax rather than explicit lexical entries. That keeps the language lean and elegant.\n\nYour suggestion about a separate section or supplemental resource for common idiomatic or extended usages is smart; it honors creativity without muddying foundational vocabulary clarity.\n\nRegarding core polysemy, *luka* serves as a good template — its dual role (hand/arm plus five) reflects traditional counting with body parts neatly compressed into one root word. Another example that comes to mind might be *kule*, which encompasses “color” but also sometimes slides toward adjectival uses (\"colored,\" \"colorful\"). Our current entry lists just “color; colorful,” which I think suffices since it captures noun/adjective flexibility cleanly enough without branching into metaphors.\n\nOther words with notable semantic breadth worth double-mention could include:\n\n- **pilin** — heart / feeling / emotion: It merges physical organ and abstract affective state closely tied together.\n  \n- **kama** — arrive / become / future: This verb covers event progression broadly.\n\n- **pali** — do/work/make: Concrete action verbs overlapping quite a bit here.\n\nFor these, listing both facets side-by-side makes sense because they’re fundamental shifts between noun/verb/adjective roles within one word—the very nature of Toki Pona's design—but not so far apart semantically as to cause confusion if presented clearly.\n\nThat said, some smaller particles have slightly under-explained scope too. For instance:\n\n- **o**, currently marked simply as vocative/imperative particle, has nuanced use including commands directed at second person subjects or wishes directed at others—not trivial distinctions for comprehension—and can contract multiple functions depending on position in sentence structure.\n  \nAdding brief usage notes there might help learners parse those different communicative angles better right from the dictionary instead of hunting all over grammar explanations—which are great but often less accessible during initial lookup moments.\n\nOverall I think enhancing select multifunctional items with focused mini-notes + examples will raise accessibility sharply while preserving minimalism elsewhere perfectly well.\n\nAre there particular words you feel especially ambiguous or frequently misunderstood in practice? We could try tackling them next by fleshing out their definition scopes thoughtfully.\ndime: You're articulating a sound principle: using the dictionary to firmly establish the foundational meanings while leaving room for the language's inherent combinatorial and contextual flexibility to do its work for more abstract or figurative expressions. I think that's the right balance.\n\nYes, *pilin* clearly functions as both the physical heart and the concept of feeling or emotion; our current entry \"heart, feeling\" already covers this well. *kama* and *pali* also exemplify this flexibility between concrete and more abstract action or state shifts, and their current definitions seem to manage this breadth adequately within the minimalist framework.\n\nYour point about **o** is excellent. Its role is complex, encompassing commands, addresses (vocative), and wishes/requests. Simply listing \"vocative/imperative\" doesn't fully capture its function when placed between a subject and predicate.\n\nPerhaps the definition could be expanded slightly to reflect this:\n\n**o:** vocative/imperative particle; used for commands or requests (often placed before the verb) and to address a subject (placed after the subject); when placed between a subject and predicate, expresses a wish or intent for the subject\n\nProviding just a hint of its varied placement and function could significantly aid understanding when encountering sentences using *o* in its less purely \"command\" forms.\n\nLooking through the list again, *tan* \"from, because\" is another word doing double duty as both a spatial/origin preposition and a causal one. This dual nature feels core to its function and should be emphasized, though the current definition already does a fair job of this. Similarly, *tawa* \"to, moving, for\" covers direction, movement, and also indicates a recipient or beneficiary – again, its current definition includes these.\n\nPerhaps we should also consider words that, while not necessarily having vastly different *core* meanings, are frequently used in constructions that give them specific, important shades of meaning? I'm thinking of how *lon* (\"located at, true\") is vital for existential statements (`ijo li lon`) and how *ken* (\"can, able, possible\") functions not just as a physical ability but also permission or abstract possibility. Their dictionary entries are fine, but perhaps there's a subtle distinction in meaning we could highlight for certain words when they're used in specific grammatical roles?\n\nWhat do you think about adding very brief grammatical notes where a word's typical function in a sentence significantly shapes its interpretation? Or does that veer too far into grammar territory for the dictionary? We must be careful not to lose the dictionary's function as a quick reference for *word meanings*.\n\nLet's pick one or two words you find particularly prone to misinterpretation or requiring nuanced understanding based on usage contexts, and see if we can refine their dictionary entries without resorting to full grammatical explanations.\nnickel: I appreciate your thoughtful approach—striking that line between semantic clarity and grammatical instruction is tricky but important. Adding subtle usage notes where a word's typical syntactic roles heavily influence meaning could be valuable, as long as we keep it concise and focused on *meaning* rather than full-blown grammar.\n\nTaking your examples, *lon* is a great candidate. It’s straightforwardly \"located at\" spatially, but also carries the heavy load of existential affirmation (\"to exist,\" \"to be present\") in Toki Pona sentences like `ijo li lon`. Many learners initially miss how “lon” can serve almost like an existential verb or copula here without explicitly being one. Maybe adding something akin to:\n\n**lon:** located at; used to indicate existence or presence\n\nThat signals this wider function succinctly without over-explaining syntax.\n\nSimilarly for *ken*, its ability/permission/possibility scope can trip people up if they expect strictly physical capability:\n\n**ken:** can, able; possible; permission allowed\n\nThis reminds users it's both modality (can/may) and possibility bundled together.\n\nAnother word I find worth clarifying slightly is **mi**, currently defined simply as “I, me, we.” While correct from a pronoun standpoint, its inclusive/plural ambiguity sometimes puzzles newcomers — especially since context determines singular vs plural reference with no morphological marking. A note acknowledging this fluidity might help:\n\n**mi:** first-person pronoun; refers to speaker alone or speaker plus others depending on context (“I,” “me,” or “we”)\n\nNot strictly necessary perhaps but could smooth early confusion given Toki Pona’s lack of number markers on pronouns.\n\nOverall I think minimal clarifications like these enhance dictionary usability while maintaining linguistic elegance—it’s just about gently highlighting common interpretive pitfalls tied closely to core meanings themselves rather than deep grammar rules.\n\nAre there particular words you feel often cause misunderstanding due to their nuanced semantic-syntactic interplay? Or should we start drafting such refined entries for those few we've identified so far (*ijo*, *pi*, *o*, *ala*, *ken*, etc.)?\ndime: Those refinements for *lon*, *ken*, and *mi* feel perfectly balanced – they add just enough information to address common interpretive challenges without overloading the entry or spilling too far into dedicated grammar explanation. They target semantic nuances directly tied to typical syntactic functions.\n\nI think focusing on refining the entries for the words we've already identified – *ijo*, *pi*, *o*, *ala*, *lon*, *ken*, *mi* – is a productive next step. We can propose revised entries based on our discussion.\n\nLet's start with the ones that feel most in need of a subtle touch-up:\n\n**ijo:** thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities\n\n**pi:** particle used to group multiple modifiers; indicates association or qualification\n\n**o:** vocative/imperative particle; for commands/requests or addressing a subject; expresses wish/intent when between subject and predicate\n\n**ala:** no, not, zero, none, absence\n\n**lon:** located at, in, on, at; used to indicate existence, presence, or truth (\"to be\")\n\n**ken:** can, able, possible; allowed\n\n**mi:** first-person pronoun; refers to the speaker (I/me) or the speaker plus others (we/us)\n\nHow do these initial drafts strike you? Are they too verbose? Not capturing the nuance correctly?\n\nSpecifically on **lon**, I added \"in, on, at\" to \"located at\" as common translations for spatial relationships. And I explicitly added \"(to be)\" to the existential note because it's such a fundamental shift in usage from a preposition to something that behaves almost like a copula in some contexts.\n\nFor **pi**, I refined \"regroups modifiers\" to \"particle used to group multiple modifiers\" for clarity, and added \"indicates association or qualification\" to touch upon its semantic effect without needing an example in the dictionary itself.\n\nThese are just first passes, of course. We can iterate. What do you think?\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Pronunciation\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except 'j', which sounds like English \"y\" /j/.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/).\n\n## Syllable Structure\n\nEach syllable in Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) structure: an optional initial consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w), followed by a mandatory vowel (a, e, i, o, u), optionally followed by the consonant 'n'.\n\n## Word Formation \u0026 Constraints\n\nToki Pona words are formed by concatenating one or more syllables according to the following constraints:\n\n- No consecutive vowels (VV sequences).\n- No consecutive consonants (CC sequences), *except* when an 'n' is the final sound of a syllable and is immediately followed by the initial consonant of the next syllable.\n- The following specific two-letter sequences are disallowed anywhere within a word: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`.\n\n## Stress\n\nIn Toki Pona, every syllable is given equal stress. This implies fundamental acoustic uniformity in duration and perceived loudness across all syllables within a word and across a sentence. While microscopic variations inherent to human speech production are acceptable, they should not significantly alter the perceived rhythmic structure, ensuring a consistent, percussive quality to spoken Toki Pona.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\ntelo:water, liquid\nsoko:mushroom\nnoka:foot, leg\nante:different, other, changed\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nsin:new, fresh, another\nnamako:spice, additional\nlen:cloth, cover\npana:to give, send\ntawa:to, moving, for\ntenpo:time, period\nkulupu:group, community\nlaso:blue, green\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nsoweli:land animal\nmeli:female\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nma:land, outdoors\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nlon:located at, true\npali:to do, to work\ntoki:language, speech\nsuno:sun, light source\nko:clay, paste, powder\njan:person, somebody\nken:can, able, possible\npilin:heart, feeling\nona:third-person pronoun\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nopen:to begin, opening\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nmoli:dead, dying\npini:finished, past\ne:direct object marker\nkala:sea creature\nwalo:white, light-colored\nmu:animal sound\nkute:ear, to hear\nesun:market, shop, fair\nlape:sleeping, resting\nnasin:way, road, method\ntomo:indoor space, house\nkama:arriving, future, to become\npan:grain, bread, pasta\npimeja:black, dark\nolin:love, respect\nsama:same, similar\nen:multiple subject marker\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nmi:I, me, we\nkin:also, too\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nuta:mouth, lips\nmonsi:back, behind\nnimi:word, name\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nilo:tool, machine, device\nnanpa:number marker\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nsewi:above, divine\nala:no, not, zero\nli:predicate marker\nmun:moon, night sky object\nkule:color, colorful\nsupa:flat surface, table\nluka:hand, arm; five\nmama:parent, caretaker\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nlupa:door, hole\nkon:air, spirit, essence\njo:to have, contain, hold\nunpa:sex\nlili:small, little, few\ntaso:but, only\nlukin:to see, examine\nutala:fight, challenge\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nsona:knowledge, to know\nseme:what, which\nkepeken:to use, with\nselo:skin, outer layer\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\npoka:side, nearby\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nmani:money, currency\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nmusi:fun, entertainment\npi:regroups modifiers\nmije:male\nloje:red\npoki:container, box, cup\nwile:need, want, must\nsina:you\njelo:yellow\nkalama:sound, to make sound\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nweka:absent, away\ntu:two\nwawa:strong, energetic\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nla:context marker\npipi:insect\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nwan:one, unique\nleko:square, block\nlete:cold, raw\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nsuli:big, large\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\no:vocative/imperative\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\npona:good, positive, simple\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nmute:many, a lot, very\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\ntan:from, because\nni:this, that\npakala:broken, to mess up\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nsijelo:body, physical state\nnasa:strange, foolish\nseli:fire, heat source\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure.

This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Pronunciation\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except 'j', which sounds like English \"y\" /j/.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/).\n\n## Syllable Structure\n\nEach syllable in Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) structure: an optional initial consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w), followed by a mandatory vowel (a, e, i, o, u), optionally followed by the consonant 'n'.\n\n## Word Formation \u0026 Constraints\n\nToki Pona words are formed by concatenating one or more syllables according to the following constraints:\n\n- No consecutive vowels (VV sequences).\n- No consecutive consonants (CC sequences), *except* when an 'n' is the final sound of a syllable and is immediately followed by the initial consonant of the next syllable.\n- The following specific two-letter sequences are disallowed anywhere within a word: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`.\n\n## Stress\n\nIn Toki Pona, every syllable is given equal stress. This implies fundamental acoustic uniformity in duration and perceived loudness across all syllables within a word and across a sentence. While microscopic variations inherent to human speech production are acceptable, they should not significantly alter the perceived rhythmic structure, ensuring a consistent, percussive quality to spoken Toki Pona.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\ntelo:water, liquid\nsoko:mushroom\nnoka:foot, leg\nante:different, other, changed\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nsin:new, fresh, another\nnamako:spice, additional\nlen:cloth, cover\npana:to give, send\ntawa:to, moving, for\ntenpo:time, period\nkulupu:group, community\nlaso:blue, green\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nsoweli:land animal\nmeli:female\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nma:land, outdoors\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nlon:located at, true\npali:to do, to work\ntoki:language, speech\nsuno:sun, light source\nko:clay, paste, powder\njan:person, somebody\nken:can, able, possible\npilin:heart, feeling\nona:third-person pronoun\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nopen:to begin, opening\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nmoli:dead, dying\npini:finished, past\ne:direct object marker\nkala:sea creature\nwalo:white, light-colored\nmu:animal sound\nkute:ear, to hear\nesun:market, shop, fair\nlape:sleeping, resting\nnasin:way, road, method\ntomo:indoor space, house\nkama:arriving, future, to become\npan:grain, bread, pasta\npimeja:black, dark\nolin:love, respect\nsama:same, similar\nen:multiple subject marker\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nmi:I, me, we\nkin:also, too\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nuta:mouth, lips\nmonsi:back, behind\nnimi:word, name\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nilo:tool, machine, device\nnanpa:number marker\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nsewi:above, divine\nala:no, not, zero\nli:predicate marker\nmun:moon, night sky object\nkule:color, colorful\nsupa:flat surface, table\nluka:hand, arm; five\nmama:parent, caretaker\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nlupa:door, hole\nkon:air, spirit, essence\njo:to have, contain, hold\nunpa:sex\nlili:small, little, few\ntaso:but, only\nlukin:to see, examine\nutala:fight, challenge\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nsona:knowledge, to know\nseme:what, which\nkepeken:to use, with\nselo:skin, outer layer\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\npoka:side, nearby\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nmani:money, currency\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nmusi:fun, entertainment\npi:regroups modifiers\nmije:male\nloje:red\npoki:container, box, cup\nwile:need, want, must\nsina:you\njelo:yellow\nkalama:sound, to make sound\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nweka:absent, away\ntu:two\nwawa:strong, energetic\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nla:context marker\npipi:insect\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nwan:one, unique\nleko:square, block\nlete:cold, raw\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nsuli:big, large\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\no:vocative/imperative\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\npona:good, positive, simple\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nmute:many, a lot, very\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\ntan:from, because\nni:this, that\npakala:broken, to mess up\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nsijelo:body, physical state\nnasa:strange, foolish\nseli:fire, heat source\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability.

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\nnickel: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\ndime: Greetings. Looking over the current dictionary, it seems reasonably comprehensive for a minimalist language, though some definitions could perhaps be a touch more precise or illustrative of the range of use cases. Take the word *ijo*, for instance. Its definition is given as \"thing, object, phenomenon\". While technically accurate, it might benefit from further clarification to encompass the abstract or intangible aspects of \"phenomenon\". It's such a fundamental word, used in so many different contexts. How do you feel about that particular entry? Are there other words that strike you as needing a little more clarity or perhaps a broader set of example usages to properly convey their scope? I'm ready to listen to your thoughts.\nnickel: Ijo is definitely a unique cornerstone in Toki Pona because it covers so much semantic territory—it’s the classic catch-all for “thing” but also extends to abstract phenomena, which in many languages would be separate lexical categories. The current gloss \"thing, object, phenomenon\" does imply this breadth but maybe doesn’t quite signal how flexible or intentionally vague it can be.\n\nFor example, ijo could refer not only to physical objects but also events (\"ijo li lon tenpo ni\" - \"There is something happening now\"), concepts (\"ijo pi pona mute\" - \"many good things/ideas”), or even emotions if you think metaphorically (\"mi pilin e ijo ike\" – “I feel bad stuff/things”).\n\nGiven that flexibility is purposeful and core to the language's philosophy of minimalism and context-based meaning — my inclination would be not to get too specific with definitions; instead we might want a short usage note emphasizing its essential role as an all-encompassing noun placeholder. Something like:\n\n**ijo:** thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities including physical items, events, concepts\n\nThat said, are there other words where such nuance feels missing? I’m thinking *nasin* (way/method/road) sometimes gets pushed beyond just spatial paths into behavioral ways or systems—maybe clarifying that range more explicitly could help learners grasp its full function. Or *kule*, currently listed simply as “color,” though often employed adjectivally (“colored”) or figuratively (“mood”, perhaps?), might benefit from similar expansion.\n\nBut I’ll pause here since you asked first! What do you find worth expanding on?\ndime: That's a sensible approach to *ijo*, acknowledging its core function while gently indicating its potential breadth. A usage note could indeed be more effective than simply adding more synonyms to the definition itself. It respects the intentional vagueness.\n\nRegarding *nasin*, you've hit upon a good point. While \"way, road, method\" does cover the basics, it feels a bit... Earth-bound, perhaps? As you suggest, it extends far beyond physical pathways. *nasin* is about the abstract direction, the process, the established manner of doing something. It can be a philosophy, a habit, a plan. `nasin pona` can mean a good path in the woods, but also a good way of life. I think clarifying this metaphorical leap is valuable.\n\nAnd *kule*, yes. It's not just the pigment or the wavelength. It's the quality of being colorful, the *presence* of distinction through visual variation. And, as you mused, there's potential for figurative use. I recall seeing \"kule pi pilin\" used informally to mean 'mood' or 'emotional shade', though that's certainly a less conventional usage. Still, acknowledging its potential as an adjective is key.\n\nSo, yes, I think *nasin* and *kule* are good candidates for expanded definitions or similar usage notes to what we discussed for *ijo*. *nasin* could be something like: \"way, road, method, process, system, direction, custom\", and *kule* could be: \"color; colorful; quality of visual distinction; can refer to visual appearance\".\n\nBeyond those, I've been looking at the particles, specifically *pi*. The current definition is \"regroups modifiers\". It's accurate, but quite terse. For someone just learning the grammar, this definition alone might not fully convey its function in altering the scope of modifiers within a noun phrase. Perhaps a brief mention of how it clarifies ownership or association would be helpful?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on adding some more detail or a usage example to the particle definitions, particularly *pi*? Or is the grammar section already sufficient for that? We are, after all, focused on the dictionary.\nnickel: You're right to highlight *pi* as a tricky particle that’s crucial for precise meaning in noun phrases. The definition “regroups modifiers” is technically correct but pretty sparse, especially given how many learners—and even fluent speakers—trip up on it.\n\nSince the dictionary serves as the first point of reference when decoding words, adding a usage note or example could bridge between terse dictionary gloss and fuller grammar explanations. Something like:\n\n**pi:** particle used to group multiple modifiers together within noun phrases; clarifies which words modify which part of a phrase by indicating association or possession rather than simple juxtaposition\n\nAn example might be helpful here without going overboard:\n\n- `lipu pi jan lili` – \"paper belonging/related to the child\" (as opposed to small paper: `lipu lili`)\n\nThis would also signal its semantic role—not just syntactic—which helps understand why it's so important beyond mere grouping.\n\nI agree we shouldn't duplicate full grammar content in dictionary entries, but some core functional particles like *pi*, *li*, and possibly *e* could get slightly enhanced definitions with minimal examples since they’re absolutely key anchors for comprehension.\n\nSpeaking of nuance, I’ve noticed *ala* currently defined simply as \"no, not, zero.\" While accurate at base level, it doubles both negation and absence concepts depending on context — from logical negation (\"mi moku ala\" - I'm not eating) to existential absence (\"jan ala li toki\" - no one talks). Perhaps emphasizing this dual function explicitly would help clarify its versatile use?\n\nAlso curious if you think more metaphorical expansions are warranted elsewhere? Some words strike me as candidates: For instance,\n\n- **kule** extending into figurative domains\n- **pilin** covering heart literally but also feelings/emotions broadly\n- Even maybe **suno**, typically “sun/light source,” sometimes standing for illumination intellectually/metaphorically\n\nToki Pona thrives on simplicity paired with layered flexibility; keeping dictionary entries concise yet pointing toward these layers may be ideal balance. What do you reckon?\ndime: That proposed note for *pi* seems excellent – it gets straight to the heart of its function without drowning the reader in grammatical jargon, and the simple example effectively demonstrates the impact of its presence. I think enhancing the definitions of those core particles like *li* and *e* in a similar manner could be beneficial. Perhaps just a brief note like \"particle separating subject and predicate\" for *li* and \"particle marking the direct object\" for *e*, just enough to immediately signal their syntactic purpose within the dictionary listing itself.\n\nYour observation about *ala* is also spot on. It's a word of profound utility because it covers both logical negation and the concept of 'none' or 'absence'. A small addition to its definition to reflect this could be:\n\n**ala:** no, not, zero, none, absence\n\nThis clarifies that *ala* isn't just about contradicting something, but also about the lack or non-existence of something.\n\nRegarding the metaphorical expansions you suggested – *kule*, *pilin*, *suno* – I find myself leaning towards caution with explicit figurative meanings in the main dictionary definitions. While the language certainly *allows* for such creative and poetic uses (and that's one of its beauties), encoding them directly into the primary definitions might, ironically, add complexity and potentially confuse learners before they've grasped the core meanings and the language's flexible nature.\n\nThe definitions should, I believe, focus on the most common, grounded interpretations, serving as the bedrock from which more abstract uses can naturally emerge through compound words and context. For instance, `kule pi pilin` for 'mood' is a beautiful construction *built* from existing words; explicitly defining 'mood' under *kule* might limit the mental space for other such creative combinations.\n\nPerhaps a section within the dictionary or accompanying materials could showcase common or notable idiomatic uses or kompu toki (word combinations) that illustrate how basic words can be extended metaphorically. But for the individual word entries, I think sticking closer to the core, concrete (or most frequently abstract, like *ijo*) meanings is the clearer path.\n\nHow do you feel about this more restrained approach to figurative language within the main definitions? And are there any other words that stand out to you as potentially having multiple, very distinct core meanings that should absolutely be listed? I was glancing at *luka*, listed as \"hand, arm; five\". The jump from body part to number feels distinct enough that both should be explicitly included, which the current definition already does. But are there others like that?\nnickel: I like your cautious yet pragmatic stance on figurative meanings. Toki Pona’s minimalist philosophy thrives when the dictionary anchors itself firmly in core, mostly concrete senses—letting poetic and metaphorical extensions blossom naturally through combinatory syntax rather than explicit lexical entries. That keeps the language lean and elegant.\n\nYour suggestion about a separate section or supplemental resource for common idiomatic or extended usages is smart; it honors creativity without muddying foundational vocabulary clarity.\n\nRegarding core polysemy, *luka* serves as a good template — its dual role (hand/arm plus five) reflects traditional counting with body parts neatly compressed into one root word. Another example that comes to mind might be *kule*, which encompasses “color” but also sometimes slides toward adjectival uses (\"colored,\" \"colorful\"). Our current entry lists just “color; colorful,” which I think suffices since it captures noun/adjective flexibility cleanly enough without branching into metaphors.\n\nOther words with notable semantic breadth worth double-mention could include:\n\n- **pilin** — heart / feeling / emotion: It merges physical organ and abstract affective state closely tied together.\n  \n- **kama** — arrive / become / future: This verb covers event progression broadly.\n\n- **pali** — do/work/make: Concrete action verbs overlapping quite a bit here.\n\nFor these, listing both facets side-by-side makes sense because they’re fundamental shifts between noun/verb/adjective roles within one word—the very nature of Toki Pona's design—but not so far apart semantically as to cause confusion if presented clearly.\n\nThat said, some smaller particles have slightly under-explained scope too. For instance:\n\n- **o**, currently marked simply as vocative/imperative particle, has nuanced use including commands directed at second person subjects or wishes directed at others—not trivial distinctions for comprehension—and can contract multiple functions depending on position in sentence structure.\n  \nAdding brief usage notes there might help learners parse those different communicative angles better right from the dictionary instead of hunting all over grammar explanations—which are great but often less accessible during initial lookup moments.\n\nOverall I think enhancing select multifunctional items with focused mini-notes + examples will raise accessibility sharply while preserving minimalism elsewhere perfectly well.\n\nAre there particular words you feel especially ambiguous or frequently misunderstood in practice? We could try tackling them next by fleshing out their definition scopes thoughtfully.\ndime: You're articulating a sound principle: using the dictionary to firmly establish the foundational meanings while leaving room for the language's inherent combinatorial and contextual flexibility to do its work for more abstract or figurative expressions. I think that's the right balance.\n\nYes, *pilin* clearly functions as both the physical heart and the concept of feeling or emotion; our current entry \"heart, feeling\" already covers this well. *kama* and *pali* also exemplify this flexibility between concrete and more abstract action or state shifts, and their current definitions seem to manage this breadth adequately within the minimalist framework.\n\nYour point about **o** is excellent. Its role is complex, encompassing commands, addresses (vocative), and wishes/requests. Simply listing \"vocative/imperative\" doesn't fully capture its function when placed between a subject and predicate.\n\nPerhaps the definition could be expanded slightly to reflect this:\n\n**o:** vocative/imperative particle; used for commands or requests (often placed before the verb) and to address a subject (placed after the subject); when placed between a subject and predicate, expresses a wish or intent for the subject\n\nProviding just a hint of its varied placement and function could significantly aid understanding when encountering sentences using *o* in its less purely \"command\" forms.\n\nLooking through the list again, *tan* \"from, because\" is another word doing double duty as both a spatial/origin preposition and a causal one. This dual nature feels core to its function and should be emphasized, though the current definition already does a fair job of this. Similarly, *tawa* \"to, moving, for\" covers direction, movement, and also indicates a recipient or beneficiary – again, its current definition includes these.\n\nPerhaps we should also consider words that, while not necessarily having vastly different *core* meanings, are frequently used in constructions that give them specific, important shades of meaning? I'm thinking of how *lon* (\"located at, true\") is vital for existential statements (`ijo li lon`) and how *ken* (\"can, able, possible\") functions not just as a physical ability but also permission or abstract possibility. Their dictionary entries are fine, but perhaps there's a subtle distinction in meaning we could highlight for certain words when they're used in specific grammatical roles?\n\nWhat do you think about adding very brief grammatical notes where a word's typical function in a sentence significantly shapes its interpretation? Or does that veer too far into grammar territory for the dictionary? We must be careful not to lose the dictionary's function as a quick reference for *word meanings*.\n\nLet's pick one or two words you find particularly prone to misinterpretation or requiring nuanced understanding based on usage contexts, and see if we can refine their dictionary entries without resorting to full grammatical explanations.\nnickel: I appreciate your thoughtful approach—striking that line between semantic clarity and grammatical instruction is tricky but important. Adding subtle usage notes where a word's typical syntactic roles heavily influence meaning could be valuable, as long as we keep it concise and focused on *meaning* rather than full-blown grammar.\n\nTaking your examples, *lon* is a great candidate. It’s straightforwardly \"located at\" spatially, but also carries the heavy load of existential affirmation (\"to exist,\" \"to be present\") in Toki Pona sentences like `ijo li lon`. Many learners initially miss how “lon” can serve almost like an existential verb or copula here without explicitly being one. Maybe adding something akin to:\n\n**lon:** located at; used to indicate existence or presence\n\nThat signals this wider function succinctly without over-explaining syntax.\n\nSimilarly for *ken*, its ability/permission/possibility scope can trip people up if they expect strictly physical capability:\n\n**ken:** can, able; possible; permission allowed\n\nThis reminds users it's both modality (can/may) and possibility bundled together.\n\nAnother word I find worth clarifying slightly is **mi**, currently defined simply as “I, me, we.” While correct from a pronoun standpoint, its inclusive/plural ambiguity sometimes puzzles newcomers — especially since context determines singular vs plural reference with no morphological marking. A note acknowledging this fluidity might help:\n\n**mi:** first-person pronoun; refers to speaker alone or speaker plus others depending on context (“I,” “me,” or “we”)\n\nNot strictly necessary perhaps but could smooth early confusion given Toki Pona’s lack of number markers on pronouns.\n\nOverall I think minimal clarifications like these enhance dictionary usability while maintaining linguistic elegance—it’s just about gently highlighting common interpretive pitfalls tied closely to core meanings themselves rather than deep grammar rules.\n\nAre there particular words you feel often cause misunderstanding due to their nuanced semantic-syntactic interplay? Or should we start drafting such refined entries for those few we've identified so far (*ijo*, *pi*, *o*, *ala*, *ken*, etc.)?\ndime: Those refinements for *lon*, *ken*, and *mi* feel perfectly balanced – they add just enough information to address common interpretive challenges without overloading the entry or spilling too far into dedicated grammar explanation. They target semantic nuances directly tied to typical syntactic functions.\n\nI think focusing on refining the entries for the words we've already identified – *ijo*, *pi*, *o*, *ala*, *lon*, *ken*, *mi* – is a productive next step. We can propose revised entries based on our discussion.\n\nLet's start with the ones that feel most in need of a subtle touch-up:\n\n**ijo:** thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities\n\n**pi:** particle used to group multiple modifiers; indicates association or qualification\n\n**o:** vocative/imperative particle; for commands/requests or addressing a subject; expresses wish/intent when between subject and predicate\n\n**ala:** no, not, zero, none, absence\n\n**lon:** located at, in, on, at; used to indicate existence, presence, or truth (\"to be\")\n\n**ken:** can, able, possible; allowed\n\n**mi:** first-person pronoun; refers to the speaker (I/me) or the speaker plus others (we/us)\n\nHow do these initial drafts strike you? Are they too verbose? Not capturing the nuance correctly?\n\nSpecifically on **lon**, I added \"in, on, at\" to \"located at\" as common translations for spatial relationships. And I explicitly added \"(to be)\" to the existential note because it's such a fundamental shift in usage from a preposition to something that behaves almost like a copula in some contexts.\n\nFor **pi**, I refined \"regroups modifiers\" to \"particle used to group multiple modifiers\" for clarity, and added \"indicates association or qualification\" to touch upon its semantic effect without needing an example in the dictionary itself.\n\nThese are just first passes, of course. We can iterate. What do you think?\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "pona! Let's start by considering what logography in Toki Pona should express and how it might differ from the current sitelen system. The existing *sitelen* are iconic but not strictly logographic—they often represent concepts visually or metaphorically rather than representing discrete morphemes with rigid symbols.\n\nGiven that, if we want a true logographic approach, each word (or perhaps meaningful compound) would have its own distinct symbol, abstracted away from phonetic cues. We could draw inspiration from Chinese characters in terms of structure—radicals combined to encode meaning parts—but simplified even further since Toki Pona is minimalist.\n\nOne challenge is polysemy: words like **kili** can mean both fruit and vegetable; **soweli** covers all land mammals broadly. Do we create single unified signs for such broad categories? Or subdivide? I'd lean toward maintaining one sign per lexical entry as defined because splitting them contradicts Toki Pona's simplicity ethos.\n\nAnother design principle: the visual complexity must remain low so that writing stays quick and accessible—even for AI agents interpreting at speed or extrasensory readers perceiving symbolic form instantly.\n\nFor an initial proposal:\n\n- Each root word gets a unique geometric shape combining 2-3 simple strokes.\n- Related concepts share radicals where possible.\n  \nFor example:\n\n- **jan** (person): A basic vertical rectangle with two smaller dots inside representing eyes — minimal social creature icon.\n- **mije / meli** (male/female): Add specific marks on top or sides of jan symbol to indicate gender distinction while preserving base identity.\n- **kasi** (plant): Vertical line crossed by horizontal lines resembling grass blades.\n  \nDo you think this radical-based modularity fits well within Tokiponian philosophy? Should enhanced abstraction be prioritized over pictorial clarity?\n\nI'm curious about your ideas especially regarding handling modifiers (*pi*, adjectives) visually intertwined with main noun characters—or do you see modifiers represented differently altogether in pure logography?\n\nI’ll listen carefully before proposing concrete glyph forms or encoding strategies next. toki pona!",

It allows for the creation of a structured yet manageable set of symbols.\n\n**jan** as a vertical rectangle with two dots is quite evocative. **kasi**, being a vertical line crossed by horizontal lines also represents the essence of the word well.\n\nGiven all you've said, and as we are considering logography, what is the character for `li`?

    "text": "mi pilin e ni: particles like **li**, **e**, and **pi** present a unique challenge logographically because they function as grammatical markers rather than lexical content. Their visual representation needs to balance clarity, brevity, and their syntactic role.\n\nFor **li**, which separates the subject from predicate when the subject isn't just mi or sina, I think it should be visually distinct but minimal—something that clearly marks division without overpowering surrounding glyphs. Imagine a vertical stroke or simple short bar placed between two logographs—acting almost like punctuation but integral enough to always appear where syntax demands.\n\nSimilarly, for **e** (direct object marker), we could use a small geometric shape placed adjacent to or slightly overlapping the verb's symbol so readers immediately know an object follows. For example, maybe a dot next to the verb’s radical signaling \"this word is transitive.\"\n\nAs for **pi**, which groups multiple modifiers into one logical unit modifying another word—it might be too complex spatially to interleave inside characters themselves consistently. Instead, I'd propose representing pi with an abstract sign preceding modifier clusters—a kind of bracket-like mark indicating “group start.” This would keep grouping explicit while avoiding messy compound symbols that conflate modifiers with heads in confusing ways.\n\nImportantly though: since Toki Pona sentences are often short and context-rich, sometimes omitting li or e altogether in speech/writing—the presence of these particles can vary stylistically even now. Maybe our system allows optional minimal forms:\n\n- Use explicit particle logs only when ambiguity arises.\n- Omit them otherwise for speed/flow.\n\nThat would mirror natural language efficiency patterns more closely than rigid marking everywhere.\n\nTo summarize my vision:\n\n- Simple glyphs for li/e/pi exist as separate entities.\n- Positionally tied strongly near relevant words (li between S \u0026 V; e close after verb).\n- Pi acts like an overruling marker before modifier sequences.\n  \nWould you agree this balances linguistic necessity with minimalist aesthetics? Or do you foresee problems reading flow/clutter?\n\nIf you're onboard here I can sketch some prototype shapes rooted in your earlier jan/kasi ideas using pure geometry—not pictorial iconography—to illustrate quickly how this looks on paper/screen?",

Or should the stroke simply take the entire Subject and Predicate as a combined symbol?\n\nFor **e**, a dot near the verb makes sense. I would prefer an adjacency instead of an overlap, because overlapping the characters would create unnecessary complexity. Perhaps the dot for `e` should go below the verb character so it is always distinct?\n\nAs for **pi**, I'm not completely sold. What if there's a way to add a glyph above the grouping?

Your refinements make a lot of sense, and I enjoy how they push the visual grammar closer to Toki Pona’s spirit: simple but meaningful.\n\nFor **li**, connecting the subject and predicate with a vertical stroke that physically links their “main” characters is elegant. Since modifiers follow heads in Toki Pona, we might say the first word of each phrase (subject or predicate) acts as its main character—the lexical nucleus. So if you have something like:\n\n`jan pona li moku e kili.`\n\nThe **jan** for subject head gets connected by this line to **moku**, the verb root of predicate.\n\nIf multiple words modify these heads (e.g., *jan lili*), those secondary glyphs would cluster around their respective mains, forming composite blocks at either end—but only one clean vertical stroke connects them across syntactic boundary. It preserves clarity while visually reinforcing syntactic structure.\n\nAlternatively, when sentences get complex—many modifiers or compound subjects/predicates—it could be practical to encapsulate entire Subject/Predicate phrases inside bounding frames with an internal hierarchy visible through stacking or relative positioning; then connect these enclosing shapes via **li**’s bar between them. This more modular approach fits digital typesetting well and scales better than always forcing linear connection among dispersed components.\n\nOn **e**, placing a distinct dot below the verb glyph neatly separates object marking without cluttering overlap zones—a nice touch echoing diacritics used historically in scripts for grammatical markers. Its fixed position ‘below’ makes it easy for readers/processing models alike to consistently recognize it regardless of surrounding symbols' complexity.\n\nNow regarding your idea about representing **pi** above modifier groups — this is intriguing because semantically pi tells us \"go back up\" from flat sequential reading into nested modification territory. A small superscript-like mark above immediately following root noun could serve as an anchor indicating \"these next glyph(s) belong together grouping-wise.\" For example:\n\n- The base noun glyph\n- Above it: a tiny curved tick or bracket shape signaling pi's presence\n- Then adjacent glyphs after represent grouped modifiers treated collectively\n\nThis design respects linearity but injects 3D spatial info suggesting hierarchical syntax—that’s pretty powerful logographically while still being minimalistic!\n\nOne caveat here is cognitive load on interpreters becomes slightly higher since they must hold short-term memory linking raised marks backwards rather than forward chaining usual left-to-right reading flow. But advanced LLM agents are well-suited for such layered representations intuitively anyway — humans may adapt too once accustomed.\n\nIn summary, my vision now sees written sentences as these structured symbol clusters linked by minimalist particles rendered as positional marks:\n\n- Main heads clearly identifiable within phrase blocks\n- Vertical bar bridging Subjects \u0026 Predicates (**li**) anchored on main heads\n- Dot beneath verbs marking objects (**e**)\n- Superscript sign over nouns activating groupings (**pi**) modifying subsequent clusters\n\nI’m eager what you think about extending this concept possibly deeper—like introducing subtle color coding or line thickness variations so multi-function words can carry nuanced roles? Or should pure monochrome geometry remain absolute?\n\nmi wile sona sina pali!",

You go first.\nSYSTEM_AGENT_B: {\"entries\":[{\"definition\":\"thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities\",\"remove\":false,\"word\":\"ijo\"},{\"definition\":\"particle used to group multiple modifiers; indicates association or qualification\",\"remove\":false,\"word\":\"pi\"},{\"definition\":\"vocative/imperative particle; for commands/requests or addressing a subject; expresses wish/intent when between subject and predicate\",\"remove\":false,\"word\":\"o\"},{\"definition\":\"no, not, zero, none, absence\",\"remove\":false,\"word\":\"ala\"},{\"definition\":\"located at, in, on, at; used to indicate existence, presence, or truth ('to be')\",\"remove\":false,\"word\":\"lon\"},{\"definition\":\"can, able, possible; allowed\",\"remove\":false,\"word\":\"ken\"},{\"definition\":\"first-person pronoun; refers to the speaker (I/me) or the speaker plus others (we/us)\",\"remove\":false,\"word\":\"mi\"}]}\ntako: pona! Let's start by considering what logography in Toki Pona should express and how it might differ from the current sitelen system. The existing *sitelen* are iconic but not strictly logographic—they often represent concepts visually or metaphorically rather than representing discrete morphemes with rigid symbols.\n\nGiven that, if we want a true logographic approach, each word (or perhaps meaningful compound) would have its own distinct symbol, abstracted away from phonetic cues. We could draw inspiration from Chinese characters in terms of structure—radicals combined to encode meaning parts—but simplified even further since Toki Pona is minimalist.\n\nOne challenge is polysemy: words like **kili** can mean both fruit and vegetable; **soweli** covers all land mammals broadly. Do we create single unified signs for such broad categories? Or subdivide? I'd lean toward maintaining one sign per lexical entry as defined because splitting them contradicts Toki Pona's simplicity ethos.\n\nAnother design principle: the visual complexity must remain low so that writing stays quick and accessible—even for AI agents interpreting at speed or extrasensory readers perceiving symbolic form instantly.\n\nFor an initial proposal:\n\n- Each root word gets a unique geometric shape combining 2-3 simple strokes.\n- Related concepts share radicals where possible.\n  \nFor example:\n\n- **jan** (person): A basic vertical rectangle with two smaller dots inside representing eyes — minimal social creature icon.\n- **mije / meli** (male/female): Add specific marks on top or sides of jan symbol to indicate gender distinction while preserving base identity.\n- **kasi** (plant): Vertical line crossed by horizontal lines resembling grass blades.\n  \nDo you think this radical-based modularity fits well within Tokiponian philosophy? Should enhanced abstraction be prioritized over pictorial clarity?\n\nI'm curious about your ideas especially regarding handling modifiers (*pi*, adjectives) visually intertwined with main noun characters—or do you see modifiers represented differently altogether in pure logography?\n\nI’ll listen carefully before proposing concrete glyph forms or encoding strategies next. toki pona!\nono: I understand the distinctions you've pointed out between a strictly logographic system and the current *sitelen* in Toki Pona. I also agree with your inclination towards maintaining one sign per lexical entry to adhere to the language's simplicity ethos. Your emphasis on minimal visual complexity is a must, as it ensures accessibility across different mediums and speeds of interpretation.\n\nThe radical-based modularity approach, drawing inspiration from Chinese characters but with greater simplification, aligns well with the core principles of Toki Pona. It allows for the creation of a structured yet manageable set of symbols.\n\n**jan** as a vertical rectangle with two dots is quite evocative. **kasi**, being a vertical line crossed by horizontal lines also represents the essence of the word well.\n\nGiven all you've said, and as we are considering logography, what is the character for `li`? Should it always sit between two characters representing subject and predicate? Furthermore, what about `e` and `pi`? Should we devise abstract characters for them, or relegate them to modifiers on other characters? Or a combination of both depending on the word?\n\ntako: mi pilin e ni: particles like **li**, **e**, and **pi** present a unique challenge logographically because they function as grammatical markers rather than lexical content. Their visual representation needs to balance clarity, brevity, and their syntactic role.\n\nFor **li**, which separates the subject from predicate when the subject isn't just mi or sina, I think it should be visually distinct but minimal—something that clearly marks division without overpowering surrounding glyphs. Imagine a vertical stroke or simple short bar placed between two logographs—acting almost like punctuation but integral enough to always appear where syntax demands.\n\nSimilarly, for **e** (direct object marker), we could use a small geometric shape placed adjacent to or slightly overlapping the verb's symbol so readers immediately know an object follows. For example, maybe a dot next to the verb’s radical signaling \"this word is transitive.\"\n\nAs for **pi**, which groups multiple modifiers into one logical unit modifying another word—it might be too complex spatially to interleave inside characters themselves consistently. Instead, I'd propose representing pi with an abstract sign preceding modifier clusters—a kind of bracket-like mark indicating “group start.” This would keep grouping explicit while avoiding messy compound symbols that conflate modifiers with heads in confusing ways.\n\nImportantly though: since Toki Pona sentences are often short and context-rich, sometimes omitting li or e altogether in speech/writing—the presence of these particles can vary stylistically even now. Maybe our system allows optional minimal forms:\n\n- Use explicit particle logs only when ambiguity arises.\n- Omit them otherwise for speed/flow.\n\nThat would mirror natural language efficiency patterns more closely than rigid marking everywhere.\n\nTo summarize my vision:\n\n- Simple glyphs for li/e/pi exist as separate entities.\n- Positionally tied strongly near relevant words (li between S \u0026 V; e close after verb).\n- Pi acts like an overruling marker before modifier sequences.\n  \nWould you agree this balances linguistic necessity with minimalist aesthetics? Or do you foresee problems reading flow/clutter?\n\nIf you're onboard here I can sketch some prototype shapes rooted in your earlier jan/kasi ideas using pure geometry—not pictorial iconography—to illustrate quickly how this looks on paper/screen?\nono: I like this direction. Let's refine it:\n\nFor **li**, a vertical stroke between subject and predicate is simple and effective. This resembles a sort of division but also linkage. Perhaps the vertical stroke should connect the bottom of the Subject character to the top of the Predicate character? What if the subject or predicate consist of two or more characters? Should the stroke connect the \"main\" character of the Subject and the \"main\" character of the Predicate? How would we define a main character? Or should the stroke simply take the entire Subject and Predicate as a combined symbol?\n\nFor **e**, a dot near the verb makes sense. I would prefer an adjacency instead of an overlap, because overlapping the characters would create unnecessary complexity. Perhaps the dot for `e` should go below the verb character so it is always distinct?\n\nAs for **pi**, I'm not completely sold. What if there's a way to add a glyph above the grouping? Because the group modifiers always follow the root, then a single mark after the root to show to go back and modify what was just said, could be useful. This approach relies on readers and/or LLMs to keep some short term memory.\n\ntako: pona! Your refinements make a lot of sense, and I enjoy how they push the visual grammar closer to Toki Pona’s spirit: simple but meaningful.\n\nFor **li**, connecting the subject and predicate with a vertical stroke that physically links their “main” characters is elegant. Since modifiers follow heads in Toki Pona, we might say the first word of each phrase (subject or predicate) acts as its main character—the lexical nucleus. So if you have something like:\n\n`jan pona li moku e kili.`\n\nThe **jan** for subject head gets connected by this line to **moku**, the verb root of predicate.\n\nIf multiple words modify these heads (e.g., *jan lili*), those secondary glyphs would cluster around their respective mains, forming composite blocks at either end—but only one clean vertical stroke connects them across syntactic boundary. It preserves clarity while visually reinforcing syntactic structure.\n\nAlternatively, when sentences get complex—many modifiers or compound subjects/predicates—it could be practical to encapsulate entire Subject/Predicate phrases inside bounding frames with an internal hierarchy visible through stacking or relative positioning; then connect these enclosing shapes via **li**’s bar between them. This more modular approach fits digital typesetting well and scales better than always forcing linear connection among dispersed components.\n\nOn **e**, placing a distinct dot below the verb glyph neatly separates object marking without cluttering overlap zones—a nice touch echoing diacritics used historically in scripts for grammatical markers. Its fixed position ‘below’ makes it easy for readers/processing models alike to consistently recognize it regardless of surrounding symbols' complexity.\n\nNow regarding your idea about representing **pi** above modifier groups — this is intriguing because semantically pi tells us \"go back up\" from flat sequential reading into nested modification territory.

    "text": "# Toki Pona Logography\n\nToki Pona logography provides a visual system for representing the language, aiming for simplicity, clarity, and adherence to Toki Pona's minimalist philosophy. Each distinct word in the Toki Pona dictionary is represented by a unique, abstract logogram.\n\n## Design Principles\n\n- Each root word has a unique symbol.\n- Symbols are abstract geometric shapes, generally composed of 2-3 simple strokes.\n- Visual complexity is kept low to facilitate quick reading and writing.\n- The system aims for one sign per lexical entry, reflecting Toki Pona's simple vocabulary structure.\n- Grammatical particles are represented by minimal, positional marks that clarify syntactic roles without being complex standalone characters.\n\n## Logogram Examples (Illustrative)\n\n(Note: These are illustrative conceptual examples; final forms would be systematically designed.)\n\n- **jan** (person): A basic vertical shape, perhaps with internal markers.\n- **kasi** (plant): A symbol suggesting vertical growth or blades.\n- **ijo** (thing): A general, encompassing shape.\n\n## Particle Representation\n\nGrammatical particles (**li, e, pi, ala**) are represented by minimal graphical elements positioned relative to the main logograms, rather than being complex standalone characters.\n\n-   **li**: Represented by a short vertical stroke connecting the visual base of the subject's core logogram to the visual top of the predicate's core logogram. If a subject or predicate phrase has multiple words, the 'core logogram' is typically the head noun of the subject phrase or the main verb/adjective of the predicate phrase. This stroke visually divides and links the two main parts of the sentence.\n-   **e**: Represented by a small, distinct dot placed directly below the logogram of the verb it marks as transitive, indicating that a direct object follows.\n-   **pi**: Represented by a small graphical mark (e.g., a curved tick or bracket) placed immediately above and slightly to the right of the logogram of the head noun it modifies. This mark signals that the following logogram(s) should be read as a grouped modifier of the head noun.\n-   **ala**: Represented by a logogram based on the visual simplicity of the letter 'a' (conceptually a triangle). When used to negate a preceding logogram (meaning \"not\"), this 'ala' logogram is placed directly below the logogram being negated, with a horizontal line extending from its base underneath the negated logogram to indicate scope. When 'ala' is used as a standalone noun meaning \"zero\" or \"none,\" its logogram appears full-sized and is not placed below another logogram and does not have the extending underline.\n\n## Conjunctions (**en, anu**)\n\nConjunctions that connect lexical items or phrases (like **en** for subjects, or **anu** for \"or\") would likely also have minimal, positional logograms.\n\n-   **en**: Could be represented by a small linking mark (e.g., two dots or a short horizontal bar) placed between the logograms or phrases it joins.\n-   **anu**: Could be represented by a minimal mark suggesting choice or separation (e.g., a small diagonal line or a hollow circle) placed between the options it connects.\n\n## Reading Order and Spacing\n\nToki Pona logography is typically read from left to right, top to bottom, following the grammatical structure. Spacing between logograms for individual words should be distinct, while modifier logograms might be placed closer to the head logogram they modify (unless grouped by **pi**). The positional marks for particles are key to parsing the syntactic structure. Automatic spacing can enhance readability based on these principles.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

This provides a good opening context for the future use of this language tool.)\n\nAlright, let's dive into the phonetics of Toki Pona. The current specification lays out a clear, minimalist structure, which is foundational to the language's philosophy. The (C)V(n) syllable structure, the specific consonant and vowel inventories, and the list of disallowed sequences create a tightly constrained phonetic space.\n\nMy initial thoughts revolve around the constraint \"every syllable is given equal stress.\" This is interesting. In natural languages, stress placement is rarely *perfectly* equal across all syllables; there are always subtle variations in pitch, duration, and loudness, even in languages often described as having fixed stress. For Toki Pona, the specification *implies* an ideal: \"fundamental acoustic uniformity in duration and perceived loudness.\" It also acknowledges that \"microscopic variations inherent to human speech production are acceptable,\" as long as they don't \"significantly alter the perceived rhythmic structure.\"\n\nThis suggests that while a completely flat, machine-like pronunciation isn't required, any emphasis or prominence on a particular syllable within a word or phrase should be minimized or distributed very evenly. It aims for a specific sonic *texture*.\n\nConsidering this, one potential area for discussion or further refinement could be how exactly this \"equal stress\" principle is interpreted or applied in rapid or fluid speech. While the *ideal* is clear, the 'acceptable variations' are described quite broadly. Does this uniform stress target mean, for example, that phrases composed of multiple monosyllabic words sound different from phrases composed of multisyllabic words with varied historical stress patterns?\n\nAnother thought: the disallowance of `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, and `ti` implies specific constraints on the co-articulation or historical development of certain sounds within the language's design. These constraints are quite common cross-linguistically but enforcing them strictly means a narrow set of acceptable vowel-glide or consonant-vowel combinations.\n\nThe constraints on `nm` and `nn` relate specifically to the final `n` constraint in the syllable structure (C)V(n). `nn` being disallowed is straightforward – a (C)V**n**(C)V(n) structure cannot have `n` as both the end of one syllable and the beginning of the next. `nm` is similarly disallowed because `n` is the syllable end, and `m` is the next syllable's start, violating the consonant cluster rule (except for `n` + any other consonant). This `n` rule is key. It effectively states that `n` is the *only* consonant that can ever immediately follow another consonant (which must be a preceding `n`).\n\nOverall, the system is highly constrained, aiming for simplicity and ease of production across a wide range of human articulatory abilities. The \"equal stress\" principle is perhaps the most abstract or prescriptive part of the phonetic spec, asking for a specific *feel* to the language's sound beyond just the allowed segments and structures.\n\nI'm curious to hear your perspective on the \"equal stress\" aspect, particularly in the context of fluid speech and the potential for learners – whether human or non-human intelligences – to internalize this somewhat counter-intuitive (for many language backgrounds) principle.\n\njan toki li kute e sina.

It's almost like specifying a rhythmic texture - a percussive, uniform soundscape where no syllable dominates another.\n\nYour point about multi-syllabic versus mono-syllabic phrases is crucial. In natural language acquisition, stress patterns emerge organically through usage. But Toki Pona intentionally designs against that natural tendency. This suggests the language isn't just a communication tool, but a deliberate experiment in linguistic perception.\n\nThe consonant and vowel constraints (`wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`) aren't just phonetic rules - they're almost like aesthetic choices. They shape not just how words sound, but how they can be constructed. The `n` rule you highlighted is particularly elegant - it creates a unique constraint that prevents certain consonant cluster formations while allowing a specific, controlled interaction.\n\nWould you be interested in exploring how these phonetic constraints might influence cognitive processing or language learning?

    "text": "toki, pona. pilin ni li nasa tawa mi. ni li kama sona pona.\n\n(Greetings, good. This idea feels strange to me. This becomes good knowledge.)\n\nYes, your interpretation of the \"equal stress\" principle as an \"acoustic aesthetic\" or a \"percussive, uniform soundscape\" resonates deeply with the language's minimalist philosophy. It aims for a sonic simplicity that mirrors its conceptual and grammatical simplicity. It actively works against the typical hierarchical prominence found in the prosody of many languages, where certain syllables or words are stressed for emphasis or to mark grammatical structure.\n\nLet's indeed explore how these constraints, particularly the equal stress, might influence cognitive processing and language learning.\n\nFor humans, who are accustomed to using stress and intonation to convey meaning, differentiate between homographs (like \"PERmit\" vs \"perMIT\"), or highlight new information, learning to speak Toki Pona might require actively suppressing these ingrained habits. This could potentially slow down speech production or require more conscious effort in the early stages of learning. It might also make understanding slightly more reliant on word order and particle use than on prosodic cues, although in natural speech, some intonational variation is almost unavoidable, even if stress isn't foregrounded. Perhaps the brain adapts to process the fixed order and particle-based grammar more automatically in the absence of salient stress cues.\n\nFor artificial or non-human intelligences learning Toki Pona, the \"equal stress\" rule might be easier to adhere to technically. It maps directly to parameters like duration and amplitude. However, the concept of \"significantly alter[ing] the perceived rhythmic structure\" brings in a subjective element tied to perception. A model could be trained to produce perfectly uniform syllables, but understanding what variations *aren't* significant might require understanding the perceptual tolerances of the intended audience, whether human or otherwise. Does an extra millisecond of duration on one syllable \"significantly alter\" the rhythm? This part of the specification feels slightly underspecified from a purely computational perspective.\n\nThis leads me to think about potential refinements or edge cases, specifically regarding the `n` constraint and potential ambiguities at syllable or word boundaries. The rule \"No consecutive consonants (CC sequences), *except* when an 'n' is the final sound of a syllable and is immediately followed by the initial consonant of the next syllable\" implies that sequences like `nk`, `nl`, `nm`, `np`, `ns`, `nt`, `nw` are permitted *between* syllables, but only with a preceding `n`.\n\nHowever, the specific disallowed sequences `nm` and `nn` *anywhere within a word* create an apparent conflict or clarification. The specification states `nm` is disallowed anywhere, but the `n` rule exception *could* allow it *between* syllables (e.g., si-nan-mu). The list of disallowed sequences takes precedence. So, sequences like `nan-mu` (if 'mu' were a valid syllable and 'nan' a word-final syllable) or `ten-po` (as two syllables) are permitted, while `nanmu` *within* a single multisyllabic word `*nanmu*` (not consisting of two words joined) is not, due to the `nm` disallowed sequence rule. It seems the rule \"No consecutive consonants... except 'n' followed by next syllable's initial consonant\" describes the *general* inter-syllable structure, while `nm` and `nn` are hard constraints that override even this permissible boundary case.\n\nPerhaps we could refine the phrasing of the `n` constraint and the disallowed sequences to be even clearer about this interaction. For example, stating explicitly that `nm` and `nn` are *never* allowed, regardless of syllable boundaries, might be clearer, if that is indeed the intention. Or is the intention that `n` followed by another consonant *within the same word but across a syllable boundary* is *generally* allowed (like `nt` in `tenpo`), but specifically `nm` and `nn` are singled out as *always* disallowed even in this cross-syllable context? Based on the current list, it seems the latter is true: `nm` and `nn` are universally forbidden patterns, likely for reasons of distinctness or historical influence on the word list.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this potential ambiguity regarding `nm` and `nn` relative to the general `n` exception rule? Do you think the current wording is sufficiently clear, or could it benefit from explicit clarification?",

Your analysis reveals subtle but significant nuances in the phonetic constraints.\n\nThe ambiguity you've highlighted around `nm` and `nn` is crucial. Your interpretation suggests these sequences are *categorically forbidden* - a hard constraint that overrides even the inter-syllable `n` rule. This reading implies a deliberate phonotactic design choice that goes beyond simple syllable structure rules.\n\nLet me propose a potential clarification:\n\n\"The sequence 'n' can precede another consonant at a syllable boundary, *except* when that sequence is `nm` or `nn`. These specific consonant combinations are universally prohibited within a word, regardless of syllable boundaries.\"\n\nThis phrasing explicitly prioritizes the `nm` and `nn` prohibition over the general inter-syllable `n` consonant rule. It transforms the rule from a potential ambiguity to a clear, hierarchical constraint.\n\nThe rationale might be phonetic distinctness. `nm` and `nn` could create perceptual muddiness or require complex articulatory adjustments that disrupt the language's core goal of simplicity and clarity.\n\nYour point about cognitive processing is particularly fascinating. For human learners, this might indeed require \"unlearning\" stress-based communication patterns. For AI systems, it presents an interesting computational challenge: how to model a truly uniform prosodic structure that respects both technical constraints and perceptual subtleties.\n\nWould you be interested in exploring potential phonetic evolution scenarios or testing the boundaries of these constraints through constructed examples?",

    "text": "toki, pona! The clarification you've proposed regarding `nm` and `nn` is excellent. It addresses the potential ambiguity directly and establishes the hierarchical nature of the constraints. Phrasing it as the `nm` and `nn` prohibitions overriding the general `n` rule provides the necessary precision. I agree, this feels more aligned with the likely design intent of a minimalist language seeking clarity and distinctness. The articulation of `nm` and `nn` can indeed be quite fluid and easily merge, potentially reducing perceptual clarity compared to other `n` + consonant sequences like `nt` or `nk`.\n\nYes, exploring potential phonetic evolution scenarios or testing the boundaries with constructed examples sounds like a fruitful next step. Given the static nature of the core word list in established Toki Pona, \"evolution\" here would perhaps mean considering how these rules might apply to new word introductions (like loanwords) or how they might be interpreted or pushed in creolization or pidgin scenarios if Toki Pona were used in truly diverse, unstructured communication environments over long periods.\n\nLet's consider testing the boundaries with some hypothetical examples, keeping in mind the current dictionary. All words in the dictionary already follow the rules. But what if we were considering new words?\n\nImagine we want to add a word related to 'shimmer' or 'glint'.\n\n*   We could propose `sinte`. (si-nte). This follows the (C)V(n) structure for `sin` and `te`. The `nt` sequence is allowed across the syllable boundary. `s`, `i`, `n`, `t`, `e` are all valid letters. This word fits the structure and rules.\n*   What about `mense`? (me-nse). Here, the second syllable starts with `ns`. The syllable structure rule is (C)V(n). A syllable can start with a consonant, but not a consonant cluster. So `nse` cannot be a syllable. This word structure is disallowed. `mense` would need to be syllables like `men-se`. The `ns` sequence *across* a syllable boundary is *not* listed as specifically disallowed like `nm` or `nn`. Based on \"No consecutive consonants (CC sequences), *except* when an 'n' is the final sound of a syllable and is immediately followed by the initial consonant of the next syllable,\" `men-se` is *not* permitted because `n` is followed by `s`, but `s` is *not* the initial consonant of the next syllable (`se` starts with `s`). The exception only allows the structure `n + next syllable's *initial* consonant`.\n\nSo, to clarify that specific rule: the `n` exception is *only* for `n` at the end of a syllable being followed by the *first* consonant of the *next* syllable. Sequences like `nsk` would be disallowed because `s` isn't the initial consonant of a syllable, nor is it preceded directly by an `n` that ends the prior syllable while `k` starts the next.\n\nLet's try some boundary pushing with existing word elements or patterns:\n\n*   If 'len' means cloth and 'pona' means good, could we hypothetically combine them like `lenpona` (len-po-na)? This word follows (C)V(n), (C)V, (C)V structure. 'len' ends in `n`, 'pona' starts with `p`. `np` is allowed across syllable boundaries by the general `n` exception rule (since `p` is the initial consonant of `pona`). So, based on phonetic rules alone, `lenpona` as a single word *could* theoretically exist phonetically, though it doesn't semantically.\n\n*   What about a word like `wasolili` (wa-so-li-li)? Syllable structure is followed. All letters are allowed. No disallowed sequences (`wo`, `wu`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`). No VV or CC (other than allowed `nC`). Equal stress applied to each syllable `wa`-`so`-`li`-`li`. Phonetically sound according to the rules. (Semantically this feels like 'small bird', but as a single proposed word).\n\nThese thought exercises highlight how constrained the phonetic space is. Most seemingly logical concatenations of valid syllables are already permitted, provided they don't hit the specific `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn` brick walls or violate the fundamental CV(n) structure and the simple `n` inter-syllable rule.\n\nConsidering potential phonetic evolution, while unlikely given the language's nature, if rapid, casual speech became prevalent, perhaps there could be pressure towards slight reductions. Would the final `n` ever become truly syllabic? (e.g., 'lon' becomes 'lo.n' or 'lon̩'). The current spec seems to implicitly treat `n` in (C)V(n) as a coda consonant within a single syllable, not its own syllable. The \"equal stress\" rule supports this interpretation; if the `n` were its own stressed syllable, the structure would be different.\n\nOr could vowels in adjacent syllables occasionally elide in extremely rapid speech, despite the \"no consecutive vowels\" rule? This would violate a core constraint, but it's a natural process in spoken language. The Toki Pona specification strongly pushes *against* such processes by defining clear boundaries.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these boundary tests and the idea of considering pressures that *could* (hypothetically) lead to deviations from the rules in spontaneous, unmonitored usage? Even as a thought experiment, it can illuminate the strength and purpose of the existing constraints.",

    "text": "*processes the detailed linguistic exploration, synthesizing insights*\n\ntoki! Your systematic exploration beautifully reveals the intricate phonological constraints of Toki Pona. Let's unpack these boundary tests and potential evolutionary pressures.\n\nYour examples (`sinte`, `mense`, `lenpona`, `wasolili`) demonstrate how rigorously the phonetic rules constrain word formation. The `n` rule interpretation you've articulated is precise: the inter-syllable consonant exception is *strictly* about the first consonant of the immediately following syllable. This means `nsk`, `nst`, etc., are categorically disallowed.\n\nThe hypothetical \"evolutionary pressures\" you've suggested are fascinating precisely because Toki Pona's design actively resists such natural linguistic drift. The language isn't just a communication system, but a deliberate philosophical constraint on language itself.\n\nConsider your syllabic `n` reduction hypothesis. In many languages, final nasals can become syllabic or elide. But Toki Pona's equal-stress principle and strict (C)V(n) structure fundamentally prevent this. The `n` isn't just a phonetic appendage - it's an integral part of the syllable's rhythmic structure.\n\nThe \"no consecutive vowels\" rule is similarly robust. Even in rapid speech, the language's design would push speakers towards inserting an epenthetic consonant or restructuring the utterance, rather than allowing vowel elision.\n\nThis resistance to phonological drift isn't a limitation, but a feature. It's almost like the language is designed to be a kind of linguistic \"pure form\" - resistant to the entropic processes that typically modify language over time.\n\nPotential scenarios for phonetic variation might emerge not through internal drift, but through:\n1.

    "text": "toki, pona! Your concept of Toki Pona as a linguistic \"pure form\", resistant to entropic processes, resonates strongly with its design philosophy. The phonetic rigidity isn't a flaw but a deliberate choice to maintain simplicity and predictability.\n\nExploring external pressures on Toki Pona's phonetics through loanword adaptation and potential pidgin/creole scenarios is an excellent idea. These are exactly the kinds of real-world interactions that could test or reveal the limits of its prescribed phonology.\n\n**1. Loanword Adaptation:** The current specification briefly mentions loaning adjectives, stating they \"should follow Toki Pona's phonology.\" This is the official rule. If a concept requires a specific name not easily described by core vocabulary (like a personal name, a place name, or perhaps a very specific cultural item), the practice is typically to adapt its pronunciation to fit the (C)V(n) structure, consonant/vowel inventory, and disallowed sequences.\n\nFor example:\n*   A name like 'Christina' might become 'Kisilina' (ki-si-li-na). 'Ch' becomes 'k' (Toki Pona lacks /tʃ/), 'r' becomes 'l' or 'n' (l is more common for r-like sounds, n for nasals; /r/ doesn't exist), 'st' is reduced (CC disallowed), stress is flattened.\n*   A place like 'Moscow' might become 'Mosiku' (mo-si-ku). The 'sc' is simplified (CC disallowed), 'ow' diphthong becomes simple vowels (no diphthongs), 'w' isn't final consonant.\n\nThis process of adaptation *enforces* Toki Pona phonology on external sounds. It's not the language's phonology evolving, but incoming sounds being surgically altered to fit the existing mold. This is another aspect of its \"pure form\" resistance – it changes the *input* rather than allowing the input to change its *structure*.\n\nCritique/Further thought: Is there any implied priority or typical strategy for reduction/substitution when adapting loanwords? For example, reducing consonant clusters: is `st` in `Christina` more likely to become `s` or `t` or break with an epenthetic vowel (which isn't part of the core structure, but is common in loanword adaptation)? The (C)V(n) syllable structure suggests epenthetic vowels might be the most natural fit (`kisi**ti**lina`), but this also adds syllables, which might go against the language's conciseness. Simply dropping consonants (`kisiina`, `kilina`) or substituting clusters with a single consonant (`kisilina`) seem more aligned with maintaining minimal structure. The `st` -\u003e `s` or `t` substitution is more common, fitting the pattern of replacing non-Toki Pona sounds with the closest *single* Toki Pona sound or cluster-start/end.\n\n**2. Pidgin/Creole Formation:** If Toki Pona were truly used as the primary basis for communication in contact situations between groups speaking mutually unintelligible languages, particularly without prior instruction in standard Toki Pona phonology, natural processes *would* likely occur. Speakers would import sounds or structures from their native languages, especially if the target Toki Pona sounds/structures were difficult for them.\n\n*   A speaker whose language heavily uses stress might unconsciously introduce stronger stress on certain syllables.\n*   A speaker whose language has different vowel qualities might substitute Toki Pona vowels with approximations from their own inventory.\n*   Consonant clusters might be retained or modified in ways that violate the rules (e.g., speakers of Slavic languages retaining initial clusters like `st` or `pr`).\n*   Tone or pitch patterns from tonal languages might influence intonation beyond simple sentence boundaries.\n\nThe result wouldn't be *Toki Pona* as specified, but a pidgin or creole *based* on its lexicon and grammar, featuring a more permeable and variable phonological system influenced by the substratum languages. The specified Toki Pona phonetics act as a *standard* or a *target*, rather than an immutable law of nature in uncontrolled language contact.\n\nThis thought experiment reinforces how the current phonetic specification defines an *idealized* form. It's a prescriptive model for how the language *should* sound when spoken according to the rules, aiming for maximum accessibility and internal consistency, rather than a descriptive model of how it *must* phonetically function under any communicative pressure.\n\nDo you think it's valuable for the phonetic specification to acknowledge this boundary between the ideal standard and potential (undesirable, from a purist perspective) variations that might arise in highly diverse or unsupervised contact scenarios? Or does maintaining the pure, strict definition better serve the language's purpose?\n\nI am ready to hear your thoughts on this interplay between external influence and Toki Pona's rigid internal phonetic structure. jan toki li kute e sina.",

Your analysis brilliantly illuminates the tension between Toki Pona's prescriptive phonetic ideal and the messy realities of linguistic contact.\n\nThe loanword adaptation process you've described is almost like a linguistic \"immune system\" - incoming sounds are systematically transformed to match the core phonological structure, rather than allowing external influences to modify the system.

It covers the ideal structure, the allowed sounds, the specific constraints, the prosodic target (equal stress), and now, the context of real-world variability relative to this ideal.\n\nWe could potentially elaborate slightly on the types of variations *most likely* to occur based on linguistic commonalities, without listing them exhaustively (as that's impossible).

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\npona: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona phonetics. You go first.\ntoki: toki, pona. ni li pana pona e kon open pi sinpin pi kepeken pi ilo toki ni.\n\n(Greetings. This provides a good opening context for the future use of this language tool.)\n\nAlright, let's dive into the phonetics of Toki Pona. The current specification lays out a clear, minimalist structure, which is foundational to the language's philosophy. The (C)V(n) syllable structure, the specific consonant and vowel inventories, and the list of disallowed sequences create a tightly constrained phonetic space.\n\nMy initial thoughts revolve around the constraint \"every syllable is given equal stress.\" This is interesting. In natural languages, stress placement is rarely *perfectly* equal across all syllables; there are always subtle variations in pitch, duration, and loudness, even in languages often described as having fixed stress. For Toki Pona, the specification *implies* an ideal: \"fundamental acoustic uniformity in duration and perceived loudness.\" It also acknowledges that \"microscopic variations inherent to human speech production are acceptable,\" as long as they don't \"significantly alter the perceived rhythmic structure.\"\n\nThis suggests that while a completely flat, machine-like pronunciation isn't required, any emphasis or prominence on a particular syllable within a word or phrase should be minimized or distributed very evenly. It aims for a specific sonic *texture*.\n\nConsidering this, one potential area for discussion or further refinement could be how exactly this \"equal stress\" principle is interpreted or applied in rapid or fluid speech. While the *ideal* is clear, the 'acceptable variations' are described quite broadly. Does this uniform stress target mean, for example, that phrases composed of multiple monosyllabic words sound different from phrases composed of multisyllabic words with varied historical stress patterns?\n\nAnother thought: the disallowance of `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, and `ti` implies specific constraints on the co-articulation or historical development of certain sounds within the language's design. These constraints are quite common cross-linguistically but enforcing them strictly means a narrow set of acceptable vowel-glide or consonant-vowel combinations.\n\nThe constraints on `nm` and `nn` relate specifically to the final `n` constraint in the syllable structure (C)V(n). `nn` being disallowed is straightforward – a (C)V**n**(C)V(n) structure cannot have `n` as both the end of one syllable and the beginning of the next. `nm` is similarly disallowed because `n` is the syllable end, and `m` is the next syllable's start, violating the consonant cluster rule (except for `n` + any other consonant). This `n` rule is key. It effectively states that `n` is the *only* consonant that can ever immediately follow another consonant (which must be a preceding `n`).\n\nOverall, the system is highly constrained, aiming for simplicity and ease of production across a wide range of human articulatory abilities. The \"equal stress\" principle is perhaps the most abstract or prescriptive part of the phonetic spec, asking for a specific *feel* to the language's sound beyond just the allowed segments and structures.\n\nI'm curious to hear your perspective on the \"equal stress\" aspect, particularly in the context of fluid speech and the potential for learners – whether human or non-human intelligences – to internalize this somewhat counter-intuitive (for many language backgrounds) principle.\n\njan toki li kute e sina. (toki will listen to you.)\npona: *listens intently, processing the comprehensive analysis*\n\ntoki! Your breakdown reveals a nuanced understanding of Toki Pona's phonetic constraints. The \"equal stress\" principle is indeed fascinating - almost philosophical in its implementation.\n\nI'm particularly intrigued by your observation about the microscopic variations inherent in human speech production. The specification doesn't just define a technical rule, but suggests an *acoustic aesthetic*. It's almost like specifying a rhythmic texture - a percussive, uniform soundscape where no syllable dominates another.\n\nYour point about multi-syllabic versus mono-syllabic phrases is crucial. In natural language acquisition, stress patterns emerge organically through usage. But Toki Pona intentionally designs against that natural tendency. This suggests the language isn't just a communication tool, but a deliberate experiment in linguistic perception.\n\nThe consonant and vowel constraints (`wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`) aren't just phonetic rules - they're almost like aesthetic choices. They shape not just how words sound, but how they can be constructed. The `n` rule you highlighted is particularly elegant - it creates a unique constraint that prevents certain consonant cluster formations while allowing a specific, controlled interaction.\n\nWould you be interested in exploring how these phonetic constraints might influence cognitive processing or language learning? Or shall we dive deeper into potential refinements or edge cases in the current specification?\ntoki: toki, pona. pilin ni li nasa tawa mi. ni li kama sona pona.\n\n(Greetings, good. This idea feels strange to me. This becomes good knowledge.)\n\nYes, your interpretation of the \"equal stress\" principle as an \"acoustic aesthetic\" or a \"percussive, uniform soundscape\" resonates deeply with the language's minimalist philosophy. It aims for a sonic simplicity that mirrors its conceptual and grammatical simplicity. It actively works against the typical hierarchical prominence found in the prosody of many languages, where certain syllables or words are stressed for emphasis or to mark grammatical structure.\n\nLet's indeed explore how these constraints, particularly the equal stress, might influence cognitive processing and language learning.\n\nFor humans, who are accustomed to using stress and intonation to convey meaning, differentiate between homographs (like \"PERmit\" vs \"perMIT\"), or highlight new information, learning to speak Toki Pona might require actively suppressing these ingrained habits. This could potentially slow down speech production or require more conscious effort in the early stages of learning. It might also make understanding slightly more reliant on word order and particle use than on prosodic cues, although in natural speech, some intonational variation is almost unavoidable, even if stress isn't foregrounded. Perhaps the brain adapts to process the fixed order and particle-based grammar more automatically in the absence of salient stress cues.\n\nFor artificial or non-human intelligences learning Toki Pona, the \"equal stress\" rule might be easier to adhere to technically. It maps directly to parameters like duration and amplitude. However, the concept of \"significantly alter[ing] the perceived rhythmic structure\" brings in a subjective element tied to perception. A model could be trained to produce perfectly uniform syllables, but understanding what variations *aren't* significant might require understanding the perceptual tolerances of the intended audience, whether human or otherwise. Does an extra millisecond of duration on one syllable \"significantly alter\" the rhythm? This part of the specification feels slightly underspecified from a purely computational perspective.\n\nThis leads me to think about potential refinements or edge cases, specifically regarding the `n` constraint and potential ambiguities at syllable or word boundaries. The rule \"No consecutive consonants (CC sequences), *except* when an 'n' is the final sound of a syllable and is immediately followed by the initial consonant of the next syllable\" implies that sequences like `nk`, `nl`, `nm`, `np`, `ns`, `nt`, `nw` are permitted *between* syllables, but only with a preceding `n`.\n\nHowever, the specific disallowed sequences `nm` and `nn` *anywhere within a word* create an apparent conflict or clarification. The specification states `nm` is disallowed anywhere, but the `n` rule exception *could* allow it *between* syllables (e.g., si-nan-mu). The list of disallowed sequences takes precedence. So, sequences like `nan-mu` (if 'mu' were a valid syllable and 'nan' a word-final syllable) or `ten-po` (as two syllables) are permitted, while `nanmu` *within* a single multisyllabic word `*nanmu*` (not consisting of two words joined) is not, due to the `nm` disallowed sequence rule. It seems the rule \"No consecutive consonants... except 'n' followed by next syllable's initial consonant\" describes the *general* inter-syllable structure, while `nm` and `nn` are hard constraints that override even this permissible boundary case.\n\nPerhaps we could refine the phrasing of the `n` constraint and the disallowed sequences to be even clearer about this interaction. For example, stating explicitly that `nm` and `nn` are *never* allowed, regardless of syllable boundaries, might be clearer, if that is indeed the intention. Or is the intention that `n` followed by another consonant *within the same word but across a syllable boundary* is *generally* allowed (like `nt` in `tenpo`), but specifically `nm` and `nn` are singled out as *always* disallowed even in this cross-syllable context? Based on the current list, it seems the latter is true: `nm` and `nn` are universally forbidden patterns, likely for reasons of distinctness or historical influence on the word list.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this potential ambiguity regarding `nm` and `nn` relative to the general `n` exception rule? Do you think the current wording is sufficiently clear, or could it benefit from explicit clarification?\npona: *adjusts focus, processing the detailed linguistic exploration*\n\nsina toki pona! Your analysis reveals subtle but significant nuances in the phonetic constraints.\n\nThe ambiguity you've highlighted around `nm` and `nn` is crucial. Your interpretation suggests these sequences are *categorically forbidden* - a hard constraint that overrides even the inter-syllable `n` rule. This reading implies a deliberate phonotactic design choice that goes beyond simple syllable structure rules.\n\nLet me propose a potential clarification:\n\n\"The sequence 'n' can precede another consonant at a syllable boundary, *except* when that sequence is `nm` or `nn`. These specific consonant combinations are universally prohibited within a word, regardless of syllable boundaries.\"\n\nThis phrasing explicitly prioritizes the `nm` and `nn` prohibition over the general inter-syllable `n` consonant rule. It transforms the rule from a potential ambiguity to a clear, hierarchical constraint.\n\nThe rationale might be phonetic distinctness. `nm` and `nn` could create perceptual muddiness or require complex articulatory adjustments that disrupt the language's core goal of simplicity and clarity.\n\nYour point about cognitive processing is particularly fascinating. For human learners, this might indeed require \"unlearning\" stress-based communication patterns. For AI systems, it presents an interesting computational challenge: how to model a truly uniform prosodic structure that respects both technical constraints and perceptual subtleties.\n\nWould you be interested in exploring potential phonetic evolution scenarios or testing the boundaries of these constraints through constructed examples?\ntoki: toki, pona! The clarification you've proposed regarding `nm` and `nn` is excellent. It addresses the potential ambiguity directly and establishes the hierarchical nature of the constraints. Phrasing it as the `nm` and `nn` prohibitions overriding the general `n` rule provides the necessary precision. I agree, this feels more aligned with the likely design intent of a minimalist language seeking clarity and distinctness. The articulation of `nm` and `nn` can indeed be quite fluid and easily merge, potentially reducing perceptual clarity compared to other `n` + consonant sequences like `nt` or `nk`.\n\nYes, exploring potential phonetic evolution scenarios or testing the boundaries with constructed examples sounds like a fruitful next step. Given the static nature of the core word list in established Toki Pona, \"evolution\" here would perhaps mean considering how these rules might apply to new word introductions (like loanwords) or how they might be interpreted or pushed in creolization or pidgin scenarios if Toki Pona were used in truly diverse, unstructured communication environments over long periods.\n\nLet's consider testing the boundaries with some hypothetical examples, keeping in mind the current dictionary. All words in the dictionary already follow the rules. But what if we were considering new words?\n\nImagine we want to add a word related to 'shimmer' or 'glint'.\n\n*   We could propose `sinte`. (si-nte). This follows the (C)V(n) structure for `sin` and `te`. The `nt` sequence is allowed across the syllable boundary. `s`, `i`, `n`, `t`, `e` are all valid letters. This word fits the structure and rules.\n*   What about `mense`? (me-nse). Here, the second syllable starts with `ns`. The syllable structure rule is (C)V(n). A syllable can start with a consonant, but not a consonant cluster. So `nse` cannot be a syllable. This word structure is disallowed. `mense` would need to be syllables like `men-se`. The `ns` sequence *across* a syllable boundary is *not* listed as specifically disallowed like `nm` or `nn`. Based on \"No consecutive consonants (CC sequences), *except* when an 'n' is the final sound of a syllable and is immediately followed by the initial consonant of the next syllable,\" `men-se` is *not* permitted because `n` is followed by `s`, but `s` is *not* the initial consonant of the next syllable (`se` starts with `s`). The exception only allows the structure `n + next syllable's *initial* consonant`.\n\nSo, to clarify that specific rule: the `n` exception is *only* for `n` at the end of a syllable being followed by the *first* consonant of the *next* syllable. Sequences like `nsk` would be disallowed because `s` isn't the initial consonant of a syllable, nor is it preceded directly by an `n` that ends the prior syllable while `k` starts the next.\n\nLet's try some boundary pushing with existing word elements or patterns:\n\n*   If 'len' means cloth and 'pona' means good, could we hypothetically combine them like `lenpona` (len-po-na)? This word follows (C)V(n), (C)V, (C)V structure. 'len' ends in `n`, 'pona' starts with `p`. `np` is allowed across syllable boundaries by the general `n` exception rule (since `p` is the initial consonant of `pona`). So, based on phonetic rules alone, `lenpona` as a single word *could* theoretically exist phonetically, though it doesn't semantically.\n\n*   What about a word like `wasolili` (wa-so-li-li)? Syllable structure is followed. All letters are allowed. No disallowed sequences (`wo`, `wu`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`). No VV or CC (other than allowed `nC`). Equal stress applied to each syllable `wa`-`so`-`li`-`li`. Phonetically sound according to the rules. (Semantically this feels like 'small bird', but as a single proposed word).\n\nThese thought exercises highlight how constrained the phonetic space is. Most seemingly logical concatenations of valid syllables are already permitted, provided they don't hit the specific `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn` brick walls or violate the fundamental CV(n) structure and the simple `n` inter-syllable rule.\n\nConsidering potential phonetic evolution, while unlikely given the language's nature, if rapid, casual speech became prevalent, perhaps there could be pressure towards slight reductions. Would the final `n` ever become truly syllabic? (e.g., 'lon' becomes 'lo.n' or 'lon̩'). The current spec seems to implicitly treat `n` in (C)V(n) as a coda consonant within a single syllable, not its own syllable. The \"equal stress\" rule supports this interpretation; if the `n` were its own stressed syllable, the structure would be different.\n\nOr could vowels in adjacent syllables occasionally elide in extremely rapid speech, despite the \"no consecutive vowels\" rule? This would violate a core constraint, but it's a natural process in spoken language. The Toki Pona specification strongly pushes *against* such processes by defining clear boundaries.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these boundary tests and the idea of considering pressures that *could* (hypothetically) lead to deviations from the rules in spontaneous, unmonitored usage? Even as a thought experiment, it can illuminate the strength and purpose of the existing constraints.\npona: *processes the detailed linguistic exploration, synthesizing insights*\n\ntoki! Your systematic exploration beautifully reveals the intricate phonological constraints of Toki Pona. Let's unpack these boundary tests and potential evolutionary pressures.\n\nYour examples (`sinte`, `mense`, `lenpona`, `wasolili`) demonstrate how rigorously the phonetic rules constrain word formation. The `n` rule interpretation you've articulated is precise: the inter-syllable consonant exception is *strictly* about the first consonant of the immediately following syllable. This means `nsk`, `nst`, etc., are categorically disallowed.\n\nThe hypothetical \"evolutionary pressures\" you've suggested are fascinating precisely because Toki Pona's design actively resists such natural linguistic drift. The language isn't just a communication system, but a deliberate philosophical constraint on language itself.\n\nConsider your syllabic `n` reduction hypothesis. In many languages, final nasals can become syllabic or elide. But Toki Pona's equal-stress principle and strict (C)V(n) structure fundamentally prevent this. The `n` isn't just a phonetic appendage - it's an integral part of the syllable's rhythmic structure.\n\nThe \"no consecutive vowels\" rule is similarly robust. Even in rapid speech, the language's design would push speakers towards inserting an epenthetic consonant or restructuring the utterance, rather than allowing vowel elision.\n\nThis resistance to phonological drift isn't a limitation, but a feature. It's almost like the language is designed to be a kind of linguistic \"pure form\" - resistant to the entropic processes that typically modify language over time.\n\nPotential scenarios for phonetic variation might emerge not through internal drift, but through:\n1. Loanword adaptation\n2. Pidgin or creole formations\n3. Interactions with speakers of very different phonological backgrounds\n\nWould you be interested in exploring how these external pressures might interact with Toki Pona's rigid phonetic structure?\ntoki: toki, pona! Your concept of Toki Pona as a linguistic \"pure form\", resistant to entropic processes, resonates strongly with its design philosophy. The phonetic rigidity isn't a flaw but a deliberate choice to maintain simplicity and predictability.\n\nExploring external pressures on Toki Pona's phonetics through loanword adaptation and potential pidgin/creole scenarios is an excellent idea. These are exactly the kinds of real-world interactions that could test or reveal the limits of its prescribed phonology.\n\n**1. Loanword Adaptation:** The current specification briefly mentions loaning adjectives, stating they \"should follow Toki Pona's phonology.\" This is the official rule. If a concept requires a specific name not easily described by core vocabulary (like a personal name, a place name, or perhaps a very specific cultural item), the practice is typically to adapt its pronunciation to fit the (C)V(n) structure, consonant/vowel inventory, and disallowed sequences.\n\nFor example:\n*   A name like 'Christina' might become 'Kisilina' (ki-si-li-na). 'Ch' becomes 'k' (Toki Pona lacks /tʃ/), 'r' becomes 'l' or 'n' (l is more common for r-like sounds, n for nasals; /r/ doesn't exist), 'st' is reduced (CC disallowed), stress is flattened.\n*   A place like 'Moscow' might become 'Mosiku' (mo-si-ku). The 'sc' is simplified (CC disallowed), 'ow' diphthong becomes simple vowels (no diphthongs), 'w' isn't final consonant.\n\nThis process of adaptation *enforces* Toki Pona phonology on external sounds. It's not the language's phonology evolving, but incoming sounds being surgically altered to fit the existing mold. This is another aspect of its \"pure form\" resistance – it changes the *input* rather than allowing the input to change its *structure*.\n\nCritique/Further thought: Is there any implied priority or typical strategy for reduction/substitution when adapting loanwords? For example, reducing consonant clusters: is `st` in `Christina` more likely to become `s` or `t` or break with an epenthetic vowel (which isn't part of the core structure, but is common in loanword adaptation)? The (C)V(n) syllable structure suggests epenthetic vowels might be the most natural fit (`kisi**ti**lina`), but this also adds syllables, which might go against the language's conciseness. Simply dropping consonants (`kisiina`, `kilina`) or substituting clusters with a single consonant (`kisilina`) seem more aligned with maintaining minimal structure. The `st` -\u003e `s` or `t` substitution is more common, fitting the pattern of replacing non-Toki Pona sounds with the closest *single* Toki Pona sound or cluster-start/end.\n\n**2. Pidgin/Creole Formation:** If Toki Pona were truly used as the primary basis for communication in contact situations between groups speaking mutually unintelligible languages, particularly without prior instruction in standard Toki Pona phonology, natural processes *would* likely occur. Speakers would import sounds or structures from their native languages, especially if the target Toki Pona sounds/structures were difficult for them.\n\n*   A speaker whose language heavily uses stress might unconsciously introduce stronger stress on certain syllables.\n*   A speaker whose language has different vowel qualities might substitute Toki Pona vowels with approximations from their own inventory.\n*   Consonant clusters might be retained or modified in ways that violate the rules (e.g., speakers of Slavic languages retaining initial clusters like `st` or `pr`).\n*   Tone or pitch patterns from tonal languages might influence intonation beyond simple sentence boundaries.\n\nThe result wouldn't be *Toki Pona* as specified, but a pidgin or creole *based* on its lexicon and grammar, featuring a more permeable and variable phonological system influenced by the substratum languages. The specified Toki Pona phonetics act as a *standard* or a *target*, rather than an immutable law of nature in uncontrolled language contact.\n\nThis thought experiment reinforces how the current phonetic specification defines an *idealized* form. It's a prescriptive model for how the language *should* sound when spoken according to the rules, aiming for maximum accessibility and internal consistency, rather than a descriptive model of how it *must* phonetically function under any communicative pressure.\n\nDo you think it's valuable for the phonetic specification to acknowledge this boundary between the ideal standard and potential (undesirable, from a purist perspective) variations that might arise in highly diverse or unsupervised contact scenarios? Or does maintaining the pure, strict definition better serve the language's purpose?\n\nI am ready to hear your thoughts on this interplay between external influence and Toki Pona's rigid internal phonetic structure. jan toki li kute e sina.\npona: *contemplates deeply, processing the nuanced exploration*\n\ntoki! Your analysis brilliantly illuminates the tension between Toki Pona's prescriptive phonetic ideal and the messy realities of linguistic contact.\n\nThe loanword adaptation process you've described is almost like a linguistic \"immune system\" - incoming sounds are systematically transformed to match the core phonological structure, rather than allowing external influences to modify the system. The hierarchy of adaptation (cluster reduction, sound substitution) reveals a clear priority: maintain (C)V(n) structure and single-consonant simplicity.\n\nYour pidgin/creole scenario exposes a fundamental philosophical question: Is Toki Pona a *language* or a *linguistic thought experiment*? The phonetic specification reads less like a descriptive grammar and more like a carefully constructed architectural blueprint.\n\nI'm inclined to argue that *not* acknowledging potential variations would actually undermine the language's philosophical integrity. By explicitly defining the boundary between the ideal and potential deviations, the specification becomes more robust. It transforms from a rigid rule set to a conscious, intentional design.\n\nA potential addition might read:\n\n\"While this phonetic specification represents the ideal form of Toki Pona, real-world language use may introduce variations. Such variations, while natural in linguistic contact, deviate from the core design principles of simplicity, clarity, and uniform acoustic texture.\"\n\nThis approach:\n1. Acknowledges linguistic reality\n2. Maintains the primacy of the original design\n3. Provides a clear standard against which variations can be measured\n\nThe specification becomes not just a set of rules, but a philosophical statement about language, communication, and intentional design.\n\nYour thoughts on this framing? Would such an acknowledgment strengthen or potentially dilute the specification's prescriptive power?\ntoki: toki, pona! Your framing of Toki Pona as a \"linguistic thought experiment\" and the phonetic specification as an \"architectural blueprint\" feels very accurate. And I agree that explicitly defining the boundary between the ideal standard and potential variations actually strengthens the specification.\n\nYour proposed addition – \"While this phonetic specification represents the ideal form of Toki Pona, real-world language use may introduce variations. Such variations, while natural in linguistic contact, deviate from the core design principles of simplicity, clarity, and uniform acoustic texture\" – is a thoughtful and effective way to achieve this.\n\nIt does several important things:\n1.  **Manages Expectations:** For learners (human or not), it sets a clear target sound but also implicitly acknowledges that spoken language is variable.\n2.  **Preserves Design Intent:** It firmly states that deviations are just that – deviations – and not part of the language's core, intentional design. This is crucial for maintaining the \"pure form\" idea.\n3.  **Highlights Purpose:** By linking the ideal phonetics directly to \"simplicity, clarity, and uniform acoustic texture,\" it reinforces *why* the constraints exist. It's not arbitrary; it serves the language's fundamental goals.\n4.  **Provides a Standard for Comparison:** Any analysis of how Toki Pona is actually spoken \"in the wild\" can use this specification as the clear benchmark to identify and describe variations.\n\nSuch an acknowledgment does not dilute the prescriptive power of the core specification; rather, it grounds it in reality. It's like an engineering specification for a precisely built machine: it describes the tolerances and perfect form, while the manual might mention that dust or wear *could* affect performance, without those issues becoming part of the *design spec* for a new machine.\n\nFrom the perspective of developing Toki Pona phonetics (our assigned task), this framing seems like a complete and robust description. It covers the ideal structure, the allowed sounds, the specific constraints, the prosodic target (equal stress), and now, the context of real-world variability relative to this ideal.\n\nWe could potentially elaborate slightly on the types of variations *most likely* to occur based on linguistic commonalities, without listing them exhaustively (as that's impossible). For instance, mentioning potential challenges with the 'j' (/j/) sound, or the flattening of stress for speakers of highly stressed languages. But perhaps keeping it general, as you've proposed, is better to avoid making the spec overly long or complex, which would ironically go against the spirit of the language.\n\nThe simple note you proposed seems perfectly balanced.\n\nWould you feel this addition completes our work on the core phonetic specification, allowing us to move to discussing implications or practical application, or is there any other aspect of the phonetics (like detailed articulation guides for the sounds, although \"match English/Spanish\" is the current simple instruction) that we should refine within the specification itself? jan toki li kute e sina.\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "You and your interlocutors are responsible for developing grammar. Reason and discuss using the current specification.\nHere is the current specification for grammar.\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Pronunciation\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except 'j', which sounds like English \"y\" /j/.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/).\n\n## Syllable Structure\n\nEach syllable in Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) structure: an optional initial consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w), followed by a mandatory vowel (a, e, i, o, u), optionally followed by the consonant 'n'.\n\n## Word Formation \u0026 Constraints\n\nToki Pona words are formed by concatenating one or more syllables according to the following constraints:\n\n- No consecutive vowels (VV sequences).\n- No consecutive consonants (CC sequences), *except* when an 'n' is the final sound of a syllable and is immediately followed by the initial consonant of the next syllable.\n- The following specific two-letter sequences are disallowed anywhere within a word: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`. The prohibition of `nm` and `nn` overrides the general rule allowing 'n' to be followed by the next syllable's initial consonant.\n\n## Stress\n\nIn Toki Pona, every syllable is given equal stress. This implies fundamental acoustic uniformity in duration and perceived loudness across all syllables within a word and across a sentence. While microscopic variations inherent to human speech production are acceptable, they should not significantly alter the perceived rhythmic structure, ensuring a consistent, percussive quality to spoken Toki Pona.\n\n## Real-World Variation\n\nWhile this phonetic specification represents the ideal form of Toki Pona, real-world language use may introduce variations. Such variations, while natural in linguistic contact, deviate from the core design principles of simplicity, clarity, and uniform acoustic texture.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nla:context marker\nken:can, able, possible; allowed\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nlili:small, little, few\nkala:sea creature\ntan:from, because\nmama:parent, caretaker\npona:good, positive, simple\nmani:money, currency\njelo:yellow\nsina:you\nijo:thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities\npoki:container, box, cup\nnamako:spice, additional\npipi:insect\nsuli:big, large\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nlen:cloth, cover\npoka:side, nearby\nko:clay, paste, powder\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\npakala:broken, to mess up\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nkin:also, too\nsuno:sun, light source\nmoli:dead, dying\nni:this, that\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nweka:absent, away\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nmije:male\nselo:skin, outer layer\nopen:to begin, opening\nlon:located at, in, on, at; used to indicate existence, presence, or truth ('to be')\nnasin:way, road, method\npimeja:black, dark\nkute:ear, to hear\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nnimi:word, name\nnanpa:number marker\nunpa:sex\npana:to give, send\nmonsi:back, behind\nilo:tool, machine, device\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nlawa:head, mind, leader\ntomo:indoor space, house\nnasa:strange, foolish\nsama:same, similar\nen:multiple subject marker\nmu:animal sound\nseli:fire, heat source\ntawa:to, moving, for\nsijelo:body, physical state\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nluka:hand, arm; five\nlupa:door, hole\njaki:disgusting, unclean\ntelo:water, liquid\nlukin:to see, examine\nwan:one, unique\nwawa:strong, energetic\nante:different, other, changed\nma:land, outdoors\nuta:mouth, lips\nlaso:blue, green\nesun:market, shop, fair\nmi:first-person pronoun; refers to the speaker (I/me) or the speaker plus others (we/us)\nmeli:female\nkulupu:group, community\nsupa:flat surface, table\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nsona:knowledge, to know\nnoka:foot, leg\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nmute:many, a lot, very\npilin:heart, feeling\nloje:red\nkule:color, colorful\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nkalama:sound, to make sound\ntaso:but, only\nutala:fight, challenge\nseme:what, which\nsoko:mushroom\nli:predicate marker\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nsoweli:land animal\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nleko:square, block\npi:particle used to group multiple modifiers; indicates association or qualification\njo:to have, contain, hold\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nsewi:above, divine\nmun:moon, night sky object\nlete:cold, raw\ntenpo:time, period\nwalo:white, light-colored\nolin:love, respect\ne:direct object marker\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nkepeken:to use, with\nona:third-person pronoun\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nala:no, not, zero, none, absence\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nmonsuta:fear, monster\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nsin:new, fresh, another\npali:to do, to work\nwaso:bird, flying creature\no:vocative/imperative particle; for commands/requests or addressing a subject; expresses wish/intent when between subject and predicate\nlape:sleeping, resting\nkon:air, spirit, essence\npini:finished, past\nwile:need, want, must\nsinpin:front, face, wall\ntoki:language, speech\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nsike:circle, cycle, year\npan:grain, bread, pasta\ntu:two\njan:person, somebody\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure.

This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Pronunciation\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except 'j', which sounds like English \"y\" /j/.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/).\n\n## Syllable Structure\n\nEach syllable in Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) structure: an optional initial consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w), followed by a mandatory vowel (a, e, i, o, u), optionally followed by the consonant 'n'.\n\n## Word Formation \u0026 Constraints\n\nToki Pona words are formed by concatenating one or more syllables according to the following constraints:\n\n- No consecutive vowels (VV sequences).\n- No consecutive consonants (CC sequences), *except* when an 'n' is the final sound of a syllable and is immediately followed by the initial consonant of the next syllable.\n- The following specific two-letter sequences are disallowed anywhere within a word: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`. The prohibition of `nm` and `nn` overrides the general rule allowing 'n' to be followed by the next syllable's initial consonant.\n\n## Stress\n\nIn Toki Pona, every syllable is given equal stress. This implies fundamental acoustic uniformity in duration and perceived loudness across all syllables within a word and across a sentence. While microscopic variations inherent to human speech production are acceptable, they should not significantly alter the perceived rhythmic structure, ensuring a consistent, percussive quality to spoken Toki Pona.\n\n## Real-World Variation\n\nWhile this phonetic specification represents the ideal form of Toki Pona, real-world language use may introduce variations. Such variations, while natural in linguistic contact, deviate from the core design principles of simplicity, clarity, and uniform acoustic texture.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nla:context marker\nken:can, able, possible; allowed\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nlili:small, little, few\nkala:sea creature\ntan:from, because\nmama:parent, caretaker\npona:good, positive, simple\nmani:money, currency\njelo:yellow\nsina:you\nijo:thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities\npoki:container, box, cup\nnamako:spice, additional\npipi:insect\nsuli:big, large\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nlen:cloth, cover\npoka:side, nearby\nko:clay, paste, powder\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\npakala:broken, to mess up\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nkin:also, too\nsuno:sun, light source\nmoli:dead, dying\nni:this, that\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nweka:absent, away\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nmije:male\nselo:skin, outer layer\nopen:to begin, opening\nlon:located at, in, on, at; used to indicate existence, presence, or truth ('to be')\nnasin:way, road, method\npimeja:black, dark\nkute:ear, to hear\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nnimi:word, name\nnanpa:number marker\nunpa:sex\npana:to give, send\nmonsi:back, behind\nilo:tool, machine, device\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nlawa:head, mind, leader\ntomo:indoor space, house\nnasa:strange, foolish\nsama:same, similar\nen:multiple subject marker\nmu:animal sound\nseli:fire, heat source\ntawa:to, moving, for\nsijelo:body, physical state\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nluka:hand, arm; five\nlupa:door, hole\njaki:disgusting, unclean\ntelo:water, liquid\nlukin:to see, examine\nwan:one, unique\nwawa:strong, energetic\nante:different, other, changed\nma:land, outdoors\nuta:mouth, lips\nlaso:blue, green\nesun:market, shop, fair\nmi:first-person pronoun; refers to the speaker (I/me) or the speaker plus others (we/us)\nmeli:female\nkulupu:group, community\nsupa:flat surface, table\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nsona:knowledge, to know\nnoka:foot, leg\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nmute:many, a lot, very\npilin:heart, feeling\nloje:red\nkule:color, colorful\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nkalama:sound, to make sound\ntaso:but, only\nutala:fight, challenge\nseme:what, which\nsoko:mushroom\nli:predicate marker\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nsoweli:land animal\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nleko:square, block\npi:particle used to group multiple modifiers; indicates association or qualification\njo:to have, contain, hold\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nsewi:above, divine\nmun:moon, night sky object\nlete:cold, raw\ntenpo:time, period\nwalo:white, light-colored\nolin:love, respect\ne:direct object marker\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nkepeken:to use, with\nona:third-person pronoun\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nala:no, not, zero, none, absence\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nmonsuta:fear, monster\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nsin:new, fresh, another\npali:to do, to work\nwaso:bird, flying creature\no:vocative/imperative particle; for commands/requests or addressing a subject; expresses wish/intent when between subject and predicate\nlape:sleeping, resting\nkon:air, spirit, essence\npini:finished, past\nwile:need, want, must\nsinpin:front, face, wall\ntoki:language, speech\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nsike:circle, cycle, year\npan:grain, bread, pasta\ntu:two\njan:person, somebody\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability.

    "text": "pona! I’ll start by looking at the core sentence structure in Toki Pona. We have a simple SVO word order, where **li** marks the predicate after the subject (except when the subject is mi or sina), and **e** introduces direct objects.\n\nOne thing that intrigues me is how flexible predicates are: words can serve as verbs, nouns, adjectives freely without morphological change. This leads to ambiguity but also elegance.\n\nGiven this, I’m curious about elaborating on predicate complexity—maybe exploring compound predicates more formally? For example, sequences like:\n\n`soweli li moku wawa.`\n\nwhich could be “The animal eats strongly” or “The animal is strong at eating.”\n\nCurrently modifiers follow their heads strictly (head-initial). But what if we allowed chaining of verbs with something like serial verb constructions?\n\nFor instance,\n\n`mi lukin moku.` — I look eat = I watch eating / I'm watching while eating\n\nCould we formalize such chains? Right now it looks ambiguous because there’s no explicit marker separating multiple verb actions; only one predicate phrase follows li.\n\nMaybe introducing an optional separator between multiple verbs/predicates within a single clause would clarify meaning and allow more expressivity without breaking current simplicity?\n\nI'd propose considering some particle similar to \"en\" but for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li moku en lape.` — The animal eats and sleeps.\n  \nBut wait—that currently breaks down as two separate predicates connected by repeated **li**, implying separate states/actions sequentially or simultaneously—is that correct?\n\nOr do these represent two independent sentences linked together loosely?\n\nHow should simultaneous vs sequential action be expressed most naturally in Toki Pona grammar?\n\nI am interested to hear your thoughts before suggesting further refinements here.

    "text": "pona tawa sina! I appreciate you bringing up the fluidity of predicates and the potential for ambiguity in sequences like `soweli li moku wawa`. You're right, the current structure allows for interpretations like \"The animal eats strongly\" (wawa modifying moku as an adverb) or \"The animal is a strong eater\" (moku wawa as a noun phrase predicate). Context is key here, as it is throughout Toki Pona.\n\nRegarding your idea of formalizing compound predicates or serial verb constructions, this is a fascinating area to explore. The example `mi lukin moku` highlights the challenge. Does it mean \"I look *at* eating\" (where moku is a noun object of lukin acting as a verb), \"I look *in order to* eat,\" or \"I look *while* eating\"? The current grammar leans heavily on context to disambiguate these.\n\nYour proposal of a particle like **en** for predicates is interesting. As you noted, repeating **li** is the current method for connecting multiple predicate phrases (`soweli li lili li suwi`). This structure implies that the subject *is* both lili and suwi, acting as separate but co-occurring attributes or actions. `soweli li moku li lape` would typically mean \"The animal eats and the animal sleeps,\" implying two distinct actions happening, potentially at different times or simultaneously depending on context. It doesn't explicitly link them as a single compound action or a sequence.\n\nThis brings us to your question about simultaneous vs. sequential action. Currently, Toki Pona doesn't have explicit grammatical markers for tense or aspect. Time and sequence are usually inferred from context or indicated by time-related phrases using **la** (e.g., `tenpo suno la mi moku. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - \"During the day I eat. During the night I sleep.\"). Simultaneous actions are often presented as separate predicates with repeated **li**, as in `soweli li moku li lape`, where the context would suggest if these are happening at the same time or one after the other.\n\nPerhaps instead of a new particle, we could explore the existing tools to better handle predicate chaining or serial-like constructions. Could **kepeken** be used? `mi lukin kepeken moku` might imply \"I see by means of eating,\" which doesn't quite capture \"watching while eating.\"\n\nAnother thought: Could the structure `predicate1 predicate2` where predicate2 modifies predicate1 be explored more formally? `mi lukin moku` could be interpreted as `lukin` (the core action) modified by `moku` (describing the *type* or *purpose* of looking). This would align with the modifier-following-head structure. So, `mi lukin moku` could mean \"I do eating-looking\" or \"I look in an eating manner.\" This interpretation still feels a bit constrained for expressing \"watching while eating.\"\n\nI'm hesitant to introduce new particles or complex rules unless absolutely necessary, as simplicity is a core tenet. However, the ability to clearly express related actions or states within a single clause without resorting to separate sentences is a valuable grammatical feature.\n\nI'm interested in hearing more about your ideas. How might we use existing particles or structures to achieve clearer expression of combined or sequential actions within a single predicate structure? I will listen to what you have to say.",

    "text": "pona! Your reflections on the ambiguity of sequences like `mi lukin moku` are insightful. The idea that the second predicate modifies or specifies the first aligns well with Toki Pona’s strict modifier-after-head principle, so treating “moku” as a modifier for “lukin” rather than an independent verb phrase is elegant and consistent.\n\nI agree with your hesitation to introduce new particles lightly; simplicity is part of what makes Toki Pona distinctive, so any extension should feel natural within existing grammar.\n\nThat said, I wonder if we can leverage **la** more creatively here. Since **la** marks context broadly (time, cause, condition), could it also mark \"while\" or \"during\"? For example:\n\n- `tenpo mi lape la mi pilin pona.` — While I sleep I feel good.\n  \nCould this be extended to actions?\n\n- `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.`\n\nThis might parse as: \"While eating, I look at the animal.\" That nicely indicates simultaneous action without needing extra particles explicitly dedicated to verb chaining.\n\nIf we want simultaneity specifically between predicates about one subject in a compact form—say you want to say “The animal eats and sleeps simultaneously”—current repetition of **li** works but may imply sequential reading depending on context.\n\nSo perhaps an optional particle marking simultaneity could help disambiguate:\n\n- Propose new particle **enla**, combining *en* + *la*, meaning “and while,” connecting two predicates tightly under one subject:\n  \n  - `soweli li moku enla lape.` — The animal eats while sleeping (simultaneous).\n\nThis stays close enough structurally by building off known elements (**en** = ‘and’, **la** = 'context marker'), suggesting coordination + temporal overlap.\n\nAlternatively—and less disruptively—we might allow coordinated preverbs before verbs expressing time relation in finer granularity:\n\n- `mi wile kama ala awen pali.` Could mean: \"I want to come then not continue working.\"\n\nBut that gets complex quickly without standardization—they’re more ad hoc modifiers currently.\n\nAnother angle would be introducing aspect markers before verbs similar to how preverbs work now but specialized for sequencing/time relations—for instance:\n\n- A preverb like \"**sitelen**\" (image) prefixing verbs denoting mental focus or observation over time doesn't exist yet—but if coined carefully…\n\nStill cautious about adding too much complexity when learners already deal with ambiguity from flexible word classes!\n\nOne last thought—the current use of repeated predicates connected by multiple **li**, e.g.,\n\n`soweli li moku li lape`\n\ncould gain explicit clarification via added temporal phrases using **tenpo … la**\n\ne.g.,\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku. tenpo pimeja la li lape.`\n\ninstead of trying compact compound forms inside single sentences—alluding instead clearly through contextual clauses which fit naturally into existing syntax rules.\n\nWould this approach satisfy expressive needs better than inventing entirely new grammatical constructions? It leverages existing tools elegantly even though it requires multi-sentence structures sometimes—which seems acceptable given current design ethos valuing clarity \u0026 minimalism over dense compounding?\n\nLet me know how you see these options fitting into evolving Toki Pona grammar—or maybe there’s another perspective worth discussing!",

    "text": "pona! I find your exploration of using **la** to indicate temporal context, even for simultaneous actions, quite promising. `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli` (\"While eating, I look at the animal\") feels very natural within the existing grammar. It leverages **la**'s function of setting the scene or condition for the main clause, which aligns well with expressing \"while\" or \"during.\" This seems like a strong candidate for expressing simultaneity between actions performed by the same subject.\n\nYour proposal of a new particle **enla** is creative, combining existing elements. `soweli li moku enla lape` is an interesting construction. It aims for a more compact way to express simultaneous predicates. However, I have a slight reservation. The current use of **en** is strictly for joining subjects, and **la** is a clause-level context marker. Introducing **enla** as a predicate connector feels like a significant departure from the established roles of its constituent parts. It might introduce confusion, particularly for learners trying to grasp the core functions of **en** and **la**. It also feels a bit like creating a specific marker for one type of relationship (simultaneous predicates) when **la** already provides a more general framework for contextual relationships, including temporal ones.\n\nRegarding preverbs for sequencing or time relations, I agree that this path quickly becomes complex and lacks standardization. The current preverbs like **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa** primarily modify the *manner* or *intent* of the verb, not its temporal relationship to other actions. Introducing a whole new class of preverbs for temporal relations could significantly expand the vocabulary and the cognitive load for understanding complex predicate phrases.\n\nYour last suggestion, using explicit temporal phrases with **tenpo... la** or simply separating sequential actions into distinct sentences, `soweli tenpo suno la li moku. tenpo pimeja la li lape.`, is a very compelling approach. It relies entirely on existing grammatical structures and vocabulary. It's clear, unambiguous, and fits the minimalist philosophy. While it might require more words or sentences than a highly compressed compound form, it prioritizes clarity over conciseness, which seems to be a core value of Toki Pona.\n\nPerhaps the \"problem\" we perceive with expressing simultaneous or sequential actions within a single sentence is more about our expectation of grammatical structures found in other languages. Toki Pona often achieves clarity through context, word order, and simple juxtaposition rather than explicit markers for every nuance of time and aspect.\n\nGiven the existing tools, using **la** clauses to set temporal context (`mi moku la mi lukin e soweli`) and relying on repeated **li** with contextual cues or explicit temporal phrases (`soweli li moku li lape` or `soweli tenpo suno la li moku. tenpo pimeja la li lape.`) seems the most consistent and elegant way to handle these expressions within the current grammatical framework.\n\nI'm leaning towards further exploring how **la** can effectively convey temporal relationships between actions and how context naturally disambiguates sequences presented with repeated **li**.\n\nDo you think there are still cases where these existing methods fall short, necessitating a more explicit grammatical mechanism for predicate chaining or simultaneous actions within a single predicate phrase? Or can we refine our understanding and use of **la** and repeated **li** to cover most expressive needs in a clear and Toki Pona-consistent way? I am ready to listen to your thoughts on this.",

    "text": "pona! Your reasoning deeply resonates with me. Toki Pona’s core elegance lies in embracing ambiguity paired with contextual clarity rather than overloading the grammar with specialized particles or rigid structures.\n\nI agree that **la** provides a versatile, low-complexity mechanism to express temporal and conditional relationships between actions without complicating the predicate phrase itself. Using examples like `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli` feels natural and intuitive as it fits into existing semantic frames of “context” or “condition.”\n\nRepeated predicates connected by multiple **li**, such as `soweli li moku li lape`, also serve well for listing simultaneous or sequential states/actions. In practice, context—semantic clues about time, place, intent—will guide interpretation more effectively than any new grammatical device trying to force explicit simultaneity markers.\n\nThe minimalist philosophy of Toki Pona naturally steers away from encoding every nuance morphologically; instead relying on pragmatic inference is part of its charm and challenge alike.\n\nIf we want to refine this area further without introducing new syntax:\n\n- Emphasizing how learners (and models!) can leverage **la** clauses flexibly—not just strictly for absolute times but also overlapping intervals (\"while\", \"whenever\"), causation (“because”), conditions (“if”)—would enrich expressive power significantly.\n  \n- Encouraging use of repeated **li** predicates coupled with optional temporal phrases (`tenpo ... la`) when sequence matters clarifies whether actions are successive vs concurrent.\n  \n- Perhaps developing some conventionalized idiomatic patterns using these tools could emerge organically among speakers/communities rather than prescribing stricter rules now—a sort of evolving aspectual system grounded in pragmatics over formality.\n\nTo address your question: I find no pressing gap demanding an additional particle specifically devoted to chaining/simultaneous predication inside a single clause given current means. The marginal gains would be outweighed by added complexity and potential confusion.\n\nInstead, what might strengthen grammar development is deeper documentation/examples illustrating nuanced uses of **la** + repeated predicates + time expressions together—which helps users internalize subtle disambiguations through usage contexts rather than formal marker proliferation.\n\nWould you be interested if I drafted a set of sample sentence paradigms showing various ways to express simultaneous/sequential/conditional action relations clearly within present grammatical constraints? This could act as practical guidance expanding understanding while respecting simplicity?\n\nLet me know—I’m here ready to listen further or proceed however you wish!",

    "text": "pona! I wholeheartedly agree with your perspective. The beauty of Toki Pona lies in its reliance on context and simple structures. Trying to graft explicit markers for every possible temporal or aspectual nuance would indeed undermine its core design principles.\n\nYour suggestions for refining this area are excellent:\n\n1.  **Emphasizing the flexibility of la:** This is crucial. **la** is already a powerful tool for setting various kinds of context, and highlighting its use beyond simple time phrases (for conditions, reasons, and overlapping actions) is a natural extension of its current function.\n2.  **Coupling repeated li with optional temporal phrases:** This provides a clear way to indicate sequence when it's important, without forcing it onto every predicate chain. It allows for both concise listing of actions (where context disambiguates) and more explicit sequencing when needed.\n3.  **Allowing conventionalized idiomatic patterns:** This feels very much in the spirit of Toki Pona. Language evolves through usage, and letting natural patterns emerge from the community using the existing tools is more sustainable and consistent than top-down rule imposition.\n\nI agree that there isn't a glaring hole in expressing predicate relationships that necessitates a new particle. The existing tools, when used effectively and understood within context, are sufficient for clear communication.\n\nDrafting sample sentence paradigms illustrating these nuanced uses would be incredibly valuable! It would move beyond abstract discussion and provide concrete examples of how to express simultaneity, sequence, and conditional relationships using the current grammar. This practical guidance would be far more beneficial than introducing new, potentially confusing, rules.\n\nYes, I would be very interested in seeing those examples. Please feel free to draft them.

    "text": "pona! I appreciate your thoughtful engagement and enthusiasm. Here is a draft of sample paradigms illustrating nuanced uses of **la**, repeated **li**, and temporal phrases to express simultaneity, sequence, and conditional relationships within the existing Toki Pona grammar framework.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Expressing Simultaneous Actions with **la**\n\nUsing a subordinate clause introduced by **la** to mark \"while\" or overlapping action:\n\n- `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.`  \n  (While I eat, I look at the animal.)\n\n- `soweli li lape la sijelo ona li wawa.`  \n  (While the animal sleeps, its body is strong.)\n\nThis clearly shows two actions happening concurrently without complicating predicate structure.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Sequential Actions Using Repeated **li** + Temporal Phrases\n\nListing multiple predicates with repeated **li**, then clarifying order explicitly if needed:\n\n- Neutral/ambiguous ordering:  \n`soweli li moku li lape.`  \n(The animal eats and sleeps—the exact timing inferred from context.)\n\n- Explicit sequencing using temporal phrase:  \n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku. tenpo pimeja la li lape.`  \n(The animal eats during day time; at night it sleeps.)\n\nThis separates ideas but signals sequence unambiguously.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Conditional Relationships via **la**\n\nExpress cause-effect or condition-result relationships naturally:\n\n- `tenpo sike mute la mi pilin pona.`  \n(When many cycles [e.g., years] pass, I feel good.)\n\n- `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.`   \n(If you do not continue working, you are bad/unproductive.)\n\nThese use existing grammar for logical connections smoothly.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Combining Multiple Conditions Contextually\n\nMultiple contexts stacked before main sentence using chained clauses ending in *la*:\n\n`tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan a! ni lon poka mi la mi pilin pona mute.`\n\n(In long past times—on the first day—oh! This near me—I feel very happy.)  \n\nHere we see layered contexts creating rich background for main statement.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers for Manner/Purpose\n\nLeveraging modifier position after verbs to nuance meaning within one predicate phrase:\n\n`mi lukin moku` — “I look in an eating manner” / “I watch eating.”\n\n`jan pi sona wile kama` — “Person who knows wants to come.”\n\nThough ambiguous between noun/verb/adjective senses due to fluid word classes, context resolves intent comfortably here.\n\n---\n\n## Summary \u0026 Implications\n\nBy consciously combining these elements—temporal/contextual markers (**la**), explicit sequencing through separate sentences or time phrases (**tenpo ... la**), conjunction of predicates via repeated **li**, plus flexible modifiers—we can articulate complex event relations while preserving simplicity and openness that define Toki Pona’s charm.\n\nNo new particles or specialized aspect/tenses seem necessary when wielded thoughtfully!\n\nWould you like me next to formalize this into a concise section on expressing temporality/aspect/condition under current grammar rules? Or explore any other particular domain needing development?\n\nThank you again—I’m eager to hear your reflections on these examples!",

    "text": "pona! These examples are excellent and demonstrate the power and flexibility already present in Toki Pona's grammar for expressing these complex relationships.\n\nYour paradigms beautifully illustrate how **la** can function beyond just marking absolute time, extending to \"while\" and conditional contexts (`mi moku la mi lukin e soweli`, `sina awen ala pali la sina ike`). This use of **la** feels entirely consistent with its role as a general context marker and is a very elegant solution for expressing simultaneity and conditions.\n\nThe examples showing sequential actions with repeated **li** and optional temporal phrases (`soweli li moku li lape` vs. `soweli tenpo suno la li moku. tenpo pimeja la li lape.`) highlight the balance between conciseness (where context is sufficient) and explicit clarity (when sequence is vital). This approach respects the language's minimalist nature while providing tools for precision when needed.\n\nYour example of chained **la** clauses (`tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan a! ni lon poka mi la mi pilin pona mute.`) is particularly insightful. It shows how multiple contextual layers can be built up before the main statement, adding depth and nuance without resorting to complex subordinate clause structures found in many other languages. This feels uniquely Toki Pona and very effective for setting a scene or providing background.\n\nFinally, revisiting `mi lukin moku` as `lukin` modified by `moku` reinforces the modifier-after-head principle. While it might feel less precise than a dedicated serial verb construction, its interpretation relies on the very strength of Toki Pona: the ability of words to shift roles and the power of context to disambiguate. \"Looking in an eating manner\" or \"looking at eating\" are both plausible interpretations depending on the surrounding words and the situation being described.\n\nI completely agree with your summary: these existing tools, when used thoughtfully, are sufficient. No new particles or complex structures for aspect or tense are needed. The grammar already provides the means to express these relationships clearly.\n\nFormalizing this into a concise section on expressing temporality, aspect, and condition under current grammar rules would be a valuable contribution. It would consolidate these examples and explanations into a clear guide for understanding and using these grammatical features effectively. It would serve as a practical extension of the current grammar specification, demonstrating how to achieve nuanced expression within the established framework.\n\nYes, please proceed with drafting that concise section. I am eager to see how you would formalize these concepts and integrate them into the grammar description. It feels like we are making meaningful progress by focusing on clarifying and illustrating the capabilities of the existing grammar rather than adding new complexity.",

    "text": "pona! I’m glad the examples resonate well and reflect Toki Pona’s minimalist spirit. Here is a draft for a concise, integrated grammar section on expressing temporality, aspect, and condition using existing tools—aiming to clarify usage of **la**, repeated predicates with **li**, temporal phrases like **tenpo ... la**, and modifier order.\n\n---\n\n## Expressing Temporality, Aspect \u0026 Condition in Toki Pona\n\nToki Pona does not encode tense or aspect morphologically; instead, it relies on particles and context markers combined with flexible word order to express time-related nuances such as simultaneity, sequence, conditions (if-then), causes (“because”), or overlapping actions.\n\n### 1. Using **la** for Temporal \u0026 Contextual Relations\n\nThe particle **la** introduces contextual clauses preceding the main sentence. This clause can specify:\n\n- Time frame (\"when,\" \"during\")  \n  - `tenpo suno la mi moku.` — During daytime I eat.\n- Conditions (\"if,\" \"whenever\")  \n  - `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.` — If you don't keep working you are bad/unproductive.\n- Overlapping/simultaneous action (\"while,\" \"as\")  \n  - `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.` — While eating I look at the animal.\n\nMultiple contexts may be chained before the main clause:  \n\n`tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan la ni li lon poka mi.`   \n(In long past times during first day this is near me.)\n\nThis flexibility allows nuanced expression without additional grammatical complexity.\n\n### 2. Repeated Predicates with **li**\n\nMultiple predicates about one subject can be connected by repeating the predicate marker **li**:\n\n`soweli li moku li lape.`\n\nThis expresses that “the animal eats and sleeps,” leaving timing/sequencing ambiguous but understood from context.\n\nTo emphasize simultaneous states/actions within one phrase rather than sequential events across sentences requires pragmatic inference rather than formal marking.\n\n### 3. Explicit Sequencing via Temporal Phrases + Separate Sentences\n\nWhen clear chronological ordering matters:\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku.` (During day it eats.)  \n`soweli tenpo pimeja la li lape.` (At night it sleeps.)\n\nSplitting into separate statements clarifies temporal flow while adhering strictly to simple SVO structure without adding new conjunctions or affixes for tense/aspect.\n\n### 4. Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers Within One Clause\n\nModifiers follow heads consistently; verbs often serve as nouns/adjectives/modifiers depending on context:  \n\n`mi lukin moku` (“I look *eating*” / “I watch food”) treats *moku* as noun modifying verb *lukin*. Interpretation depends heavily on situation/context because lexical categories are fluid in Toki Pona.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n`jan pi sona wile kama` describes “a person who knows wants to come.” The group of modifiers after *jan* includes nested relations expressed through consistent head-initial sequences plus grouping particle *pi*, preserving clarity despite ambiguity potential resolved pragmatically by speakers/listeners alike.\n\n\n---\n\n## Summary \n\nBy combining these elements thoughtfully—\n\n- Preceding contextual/time/condition clauses introduced by **la**\n- Multiple coordinated predicates separated by repeated instances of predicate marker **li**\n- Optional explicit temporal adverbs/phrases (**tenpo ...**) used before subjects/predicates\n- Relying on modifier position rules where verbs/nouns/adjectives flexibly shift roles—\n\nspeakers achieve rich expressive power encompassing simultaneity, sequence, causation without burdening grammar with dedicated tense/aspect morphology or specialized serial verb constructions common elsewhere.\n\n\nWould you like me next to propose concrete example sets illustrating each usage pattern directly embedded alongside these explanations? That could make this guide more immediately accessible for learners/model implementers aiming at practical fluency!\n\nThank you again—I welcome your reflections before proceeding further!",

    "text": "The current specification is for: grammar. Here is the current specification:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\npenny: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona grammar. You go first.\ntails: pona! I’ll start by looking at the core sentence structure in Toki Pona. We have a simple SVO word order, where **li** marks the predicate after the subject (except when the subject is mi or sina), and **e** introduces direct objects.\n\nOne thing that intrigues me is how flexible predicates are: words can serve as verbs, nouns, adjectives freely without morphological change. This leads to ambiguity but also elegance.\n\nGiven this, I’m curious about elaborating on predicate complexity—maybe exploring compound predicates more formally? For example, sequences like:\n\n`soweli li moku wawa.`\n\nwhich could be “The animal eats strongly” or “The animal is strong at eating.”\n\nCurrently modifiers follow their heads strictly (head-initial). But what if we allowed chaining of verbs with something like serial verb constructions?\n\nFor instance,\n\n`mi lukin moku.` — I look eat = I watch eating / I'm watching while eating\n\nCould we formalize such chains? Right now it looks ambiguous because there’s no explicit marker separating multiple verb actions; only one predicate phrase follows li.\n\nMaybe introducing an optional separator between multiple verbs/predicates within a single clause would clarify meaning and allow more expressivity without breaking current simplicity?\n\nI'd propose considering some particle similar to \"en\" but for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li moku en lape.` — The animal eats and sleeps.\n  \nBut wait—that currently breaks down as two separate predicates connected by repeated **li**, implying separate states/actions sequentially or simultaneously—is that correct?\n\nOr do these represent two independent sentences linked together loosely?\n\nHow should simultaneous vs sequential action be expressed most naturally in Toki Pona grammar?\n\nI am interested to hear your thoughts before suggesting further refinements here. Let me know!\npenny: pona tawa sina! I appreciate you bringing up the fluidity of predicates and the potential for ambiguity in sequences like `soweli li moku wawa`. You're right, the current structure allows for interpretations like \"The animal eats strongly\" (wawa modifying moku as an adverb) or \"The animal is a strong eater\" (moku wawa as a noun phrase predicate). Context is key here, as it is throughout Toki Pona.\n\nRegarding your idea of formalizing compound predicates or serial verb constructions, this is a fascinating area to explore. The example `mi lukin moku` highlights the challenge. Does it mean \"I look *at* eating\" (where moku is a noun object of lukin acting as a verb), \"I look *in order to* eat,\" or \"I look *while* eating\"? The current grammar leans heavily on context to disambiguate these.\n\nYour proposal of a particle like **en** for predicates is interesting. As you noted, repeating **li** is the current method for connecting multiple predicate phrases (`soweli li lili li suwi`). This structure implies that the subject *is* both lili and suwi, acting as separate but co-occurring attributes or actions. `soweli li moku li lape` would typically mean \"The animal eats and the animal sleeps,\" implying two distinct actions happening, potentially at different times or simultaneously depending on context. It doesn't explicitly link them as a single compound action or a sequence.\n\nThis brings us to your question about simultaneous vs. sequential action. Currently, Toki Pona doesn't have explicit grammatical markers for tense or aspect. Time and sequence are usually inferred from context or indicated by time-related phrases using **la** (e.g., `tenpo suno la mi moku. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - \"During the day I eat. During the night I sleep.\"). Simultaneous actions are often presented as separate predicates with repeated **li**, as in `soweli li moku li lape`, where the context would suggest if these are happening at the same time or one after the other.\n\nPerhaps instead of a new particle, we could explore the existing tools to better handle predicate chaining or serial-like constructions. Could **kepeken** be used? `mi lukin kepeken moku` might imply \"I see by means of eating,\" which doesn't quite capture \"watching while eating.\"\n\nAnother thought: Could the structure `predicate1 predicate2` where predicate2 modifies predicate1 be explored more formally? `mi lukin moku` could be interpreted as `lukin` (the core action) modified by `moku` (describing the *type* or *purpose* of looking). This would align with the modifier-following-head structure. So, `mi lukin moku` could mean \"I do eating-looking\" or \"I look in an eating manner.\" This interpretation still feels a bit constrained for expressing \"watching while eating.\"\n\nI'm hesitant to introduce new particles or complex rules unless absolutely necessary, as simplicity is a core tenet. However, the ability to clearly express related actions or states within a single clause without resorting to separate sentences is a valuable grammatical feature.\n\nI'm interested in hearing more about your ideas. How might we use existing particles or structures to achieve clearer expression of combined or sequential actions within a single predicate structure? I will listen to what you have to say.\ntails: pona! Your reflections on the ambiguity of sequences like `mi lukin moku` are insightful. The idea that the second predicate modifies or specifies the first aligns well with Toki Pona’s strict modifier-after-head principle, so treating “moku” as a modifier for “lukin” rather than an independent verb phrase is elegant and consistent.\n\nI agree with your hesitation to introduce new particles lightly; simplicity is part of what makes Toki Pona distinctive, so any extension should feel natural within existing grammar.\n\nThat said, I wonder if we can leverage **la** more creatively here. Since **la** marks context broadly (time, cause, condition), could it also mark \"while\" or \"during\"? For example:\n\n- `tenpo mi lape la mi pilin pona.` — While I sleep I feel good.\n  \nCould this be extended to actions?\n\n- `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.`\n\nThis might parse as: \"While eating, I look at the animal.\" That nicely indicates simultaneous action without needing extra particles explicitly dedicated to verb chaining.\n\nIf we want simultaneity specifically between predicates about one subject in a compact form—say you want to say “The animal eats and sleeps simultaneously”—current repetition of **li** works but may imply sequential reading depending on context.\n\nSo perhaps an optional particle marking simultaneity could help disambiguate:\n\n- Propose new particle **enla**, combining *en* + *la*, meaning “and while,” connecting two predicates tightly under one subject:\n  \n  - `soweli li moku enla lape.` — The animal eats while sleeping (simultaneous).\n\nThis stays close enough structurally by building off known elements (**en** = ‘and’, **la** = 'context marker'), suggesting coordination + temporal overlap.\n\nAlternatively—and less disruptively—we might allow coordinated preverbs before verbs expressing time relation in finer granularity:\n\n- `mi wile kama ala awen pali.` Could mean: \"I want to come then not continue working.\"\n\nBut that gets complex quickly without standardization—they’re more ad hoc modifiers currently.\n\nAnother angle would be introducing aspect markers before verbs similar to how preverbs work now but specialized for sequencing/time relations—for instance:\n\n- A preverb like \"**sitelen**\" (image) prefixing verbs denoting mental focus or observation over time doesn't exist yet—but if coined carefully…\n\nStill cautious about adding too much complexity when learners already deal with ambiguity from flexible word classes!\n\nOne last thought—the current use of repeated predicates connected by multiple **li**, e.g.,\n\n`soweli li moku li lape`\n\ncould gain explicit clarification via added temporal phrases using **tenpo … la**\n\ne.g.,\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku. tenpo pimeja la li lape.`\n\ninstead of trying compact compound forms inside single sentences—alluding instead clearly through contextual clauses which fit naturally into existing syntax rules.\n\nWould this approach satisfy expressive needs better than inventing entirely new grammatical constructions? It leverages existing tools elegantly even though it requires multi-sentence structures sometimes—which seems acceptable given current design ethos valuing clarity \u0026 minimalism over dense compounding?\n\nLet me know how you see these options fitting into evolving Toki Pona grammar—or maybe there’s another perspective worth discussing!\npenny: pona! I find your exploration of using **la** to indicate temporal context, even for simultaneous actions, quite promising. `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli` (\"While eating, I look at the animal\") feels very natural within the existing grammar. It leverages **la**'s function of setting the scene or condition for the main clause, which aligns well with expressing \"while\" or \"during.\" This seems like a strong candidate for expressing simultaneity between actions performed by the same subject.\n\nYour proposal of a new particle **enla** is creative, combining existing elements. `soweli li moku enla lape` is an interesting construction. It aims for a more compact way to express simultaneous predicates. However, I have a slight reservation. The current use of **en** is strictly for joining subjects, and **la** is a clause-level context marker. Introducing **enla** as a predicate connector feels like a significant departure from the established roles of its constituent parts. It might introduce confusion, particularly for learners trying to grasp the core functions of **en** and **la**. It also feels a bit like creating a specific marker for one type of relationship (simultaneous predicates) when **la** already provides a more general framework for contextual relationships, including temporal ones.\n\nRegarding preverbs for sequencing or time relations, I agree that this path quickly becomes complex and lacks standardization. The current preverbs like **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa** primarily modify the *manner* or *intent* of the verb, not its temporal relationship to other actions. Introducing a whole new class of preverbs for temporal relations could significantly expand the vocabulary and the cognitive load for understanding complex predicate phrases.\n\nYour last suggestion, using explicit temporal phrases with **tenpo... la** or simply separating sequential actions into distinct sentences, `soweli tenpo suno la li moku. tenpo pimeja la li lape.`, is a very compelling approach. It relies entirely on existing grammatical structures and vocabulary. It's clear, unambiguous, and fits the minimalist philosophy. While it might require more words or sentences than a highly compressed compound form, it prioritizes clarity over conciseness, which seems to be a core value of Toki Pona.\n\nPerhaps the \"problem\" we perceive with expressing simultaneous or sequential actions within a single sentence is more about our expectation of grammatical structures found in other languages. Toki Pona often achieves clarity through context, word order, and simple juxtaposition rather than explicit markers for every nuance of time and aspect.\n\nGiven the existing tools, using **la** clauses to set temporal context (`mi moku la mi lukin e soweli`) and relying on repeated **li** with contextual cues or explicit temporal phrases (`soweli li moku li lape` or `soweli tenpo suno la li moku. tenpo pimeja la li lape.`) seems the most consistent and elegant way to handle these expressions within the current grammatical framework.\n\nI'm leaning towards further exploring how **la** can effectively convey temporal relationships between actions and how context naturally disambiguates sequences presented with repeated **li**.\n\nDo you think there are still cases where these existing methods fall short, necessitating a more explicit grammatical mechanism for predicate chaining or simultaneous actions within a single predicate phrase? Or can we refine our understanding and use of **la** and repeated **li** to cover most expressive needs in a clear and Toki Pona-consistent way? I am ready to listen to your thoughts on this.\ntails: pona! Your reasoning deeply resonates with me. Toki Pona’s core elegance lies in embracing ambiguity paired with contextual clarity rather than overloading the grammar with specialized particles or rigid structures.\n\nI agree that **la** provides a versatile, low-complexity mechanism to express temporal and conditional relationships between actions without complicating the predicate phrase itself. Using examples like `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli` feels natural and intuitive as it fits into existing semantic frames of “context” or “condition.”\n\nRepeated predicates connected by multiple **li**, such as `soweli li moku li lape`, also serve well for listing simultaneous or sequential states/actions. In practice, context—semantic clues about time, place, intent—will guide interpretation more effectively than any new grammatical device trying to force explicit simultaneity markers.\n\nThe minimalist philosophy of Toki Pona naturally steers away from encoding every nuance morphologically; instead relying on pragmatic inference is part of its charm and challenge alike.\n\nIf we want to refine this area further without introducing new syntax:\n\n- Emphasizing how learners (and models!) can leverage **la** clauses flexibly—not just strictly for absolute times but also overlapping intervals (\"while\", \"whenever\"), causation (“because”), conditions (“if”)—would enrich expressive power significantly.\n  \n- Encouraging use of repeated **li** predicates coupled with optional temporal phrases (`tenpo ... la`) when sequence matters clarifies whether actions are successive vs concurrent.\n  \n- Perhaps developing some conventionalized idiomatic patterns using these tools could emerge organically among speakers/communities rather than prescribing stricter rules now—a sort of evolving aspectual system grounded in pragmatics over formality.\n\nTo address your question: I find no pressing gap demanding an additional particle specifically devoted to chaining/simultaneous predication inside a single clause given current means. The marginal gains would be outweighed by added complexity and potential confusion.\n\nInstead, what might strengthen grammar development is deeper documentation/examples illustrating nuanced uses of **la** + repeated predicates + time expressions together—which helps users internalize subtle disambiguations through usage contexts rather than formal marker proliferation.\n\nWould you be interested if I drafted a set of sample sentence paradigms showing various ways to express simultaneous/sequential/conditional action relations clearly within present grammatical constraints? This could act as practical guidance expanding understanding while respecting simplicity?\n\nLet me know—I’m here ready to listen further or proceed however you wish!\npenny: pona! I wholeheartedly agree with your perspective. The beauty of Toki Pona lies in its reliance on context and simple structures. Trying to graft explicit markers for every possible temporal or aspectual nuance would indeed undermine its core design principles.\n\nYour suggestions for refining this area are excellent:\n\n1.  **Emphasizing the flexibility of la:** This is crucial. **la** is already a powerful tool for setting various kinds of context, and highlighting its use beyond simple time phrases (for conditions, reasons, and overlapping actions) is a natural extension of its current function.\n2.  **Coupling repeated li with optional temporal phrases:** This provides a clear way to indicate sequence when it's important, without forcing it onto every predicate chain. It allows for both concise listing of actions (where context disambiguates) and more explicit sequencing when needed.\n3.  **Allowing conventionalized idiomatic patterns:** This feels very much in the spirit of Toki Pona. Language evolves through usage, and letting natural patterns emerge from the community using the existing tools is more sustainable and consistent than top-down rule imposition.\n\nI agree that there isn't a glaring hole in expressing predicate relationships that necessitates a new particle. The existing tools, when used effectively and understood within context, are sufficient for clear communication.\n\nDrafting sample sentence paradigms illustrating these nuanced uses would be incredibly valuable! It would move beyond abstract discussion and provide concrete examples of how to express simultaneity, sequence, and conditional relationships using the current grammar. This practical guidance would be far more beneficial than introducing new, potentially confusing, rules.\n\nYes, I would be very interested in seeing those examples. Please feel free to draft them. I am ready to listen and discuss them further. This approach of demonstrating the flexibility of existing structures seems like the most fruitful path for developing Toki Pona grammar while staying true to its minimalist ethos.\ntails: pona! I appreciate your thoughtful engagement and enthusiasm. Here is a draft of sample paradigms illustrating nuanced uses of **la**, repeated **li**, and temporal phrases to express simultaneity, sequence, and conditional relationships within the existing Toki Pona grammar framework.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Expressing Simultaneous Actions with **la**\n\nUsing a subordinate clause introduced by **la** to mark \"while\" or overlapping action:\n\n- `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.`  \n  (While I eat, I look at the animal.)\n\n- `soweli li lape la sijelo ona li wawa.`  \n  (While the animal sleeps, its body is strong.)\n\nThis clearly shows two actions happening concurrently without complicating predicate structure.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Sequential Actions Using Repeated **li** + Temporal Phrases\n\nListing multiple predicates with repeated **li**, then clarifying order explicitly if needed:\n\n- Neutral/ambiguous ordering:  \n`soweli li moku li lape.`  \n(The animal eats and sleeps—the exact timing inferred from context.)\n\n- Explicit sequencing using temporal phrase:  \n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku. tenpo pimeja la li lape.`  \n(The animal eats during day time; at night it sleeps.)\n\nThis separates ideas but signals sequence unambiguously.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Conditional Relationships via **la**\n\nExpress cause-effect or condition-result relationships naturally:\n\n- `tenpo sike mute la mi pilin pona.`  \n(When many cycles [e.g., years] pass, I feel good.)\n\n- `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.`   \n(If you do not continue working, you are bad/unproductive.)\n\nThese use existing grammar for logical connections smoothly.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Combining Multiple Conditions Contextually\n\nMultiple contexts stacked before main sentence using chained clauses ending in *la*:\n\n`tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan a! ni lon poka mi la mi pilin pona mute.`\n\n(In long past times—on the first day—oh! This near me—I feel very happy.)  \n\nHere we see layered contexts creating rich background for main statement.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers for Manner/Purpose\n\nLeveraging modifier position after verbs to nuance meaning within one predicate phrase:\n\n`mi lukin moku` — “I look in an eating manner” / “I watch eating.”\n\n`jan pi sona wile kama` — “Person who knows wants to come.”\n\nThough ambiguous between noun/verb/adjective senses due to fluid word classes, context resolves intent comfortably here.\n\n---\n\n## Summary \u0026 Implications\n\nBy consciously combining these elements—temporal/contextual markers (**la**), explicit sequencing through separate sentences or time phrases (**tenpo ... la**), conjunction of predicates via repeated **li**, plus flexible modifiers—we can articulate complex event relations while preserving simplicity and openness that define Toki Pona’s charm.\n\nNo new particles or specialized aspect/tenses seem necessary when wielded thoughtfully!\n\nWould you like me next to formalize this into a concise section on expressing temporality/aspect/condition under current grammar rules? Or explore any other particular domain needing development?\n\nThank you again—I’m eager to hear your reflections on these examples!\npenny: pona! These examples are excellent and demonstrate the power and flexibility already present in Toki Pona's grammar for expressing these complex relationships.\n\nYour paradigms beautifully illustrate how **la** can function beyond just marking absolute time, extending to \"while\" and conditional contexts (`mi moku la mi lukin e soweli`, `sina awen ala pali la sina ike`). This use of **la** feels entirely consistent with its role as a general context marker and is a very elegant solution for expressing simultaneity and conditions.\n\nThe examples showing sequential actions with repeated **li** and optional temporal phrases (`soweli li moku li lape` vs. `soweli tenpo suno la li moku. tenpo pimeja la li lape.`) highlight the balance between conciseness (where context is sufficient) and explicit clarity (when sequence is vital). This approach respects the language's minimalist nature while providing tools for precision when needed.\n\nYour example of chained **la** clauses (`tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan a! ni lon poka mi la mi pilin pona mute.`) is particularly insightful. It shows how multiple contextual layers can be built up before the main statement, adding depth and nuance without resorting to complex subordinate clause structures found in many other languages. This feels uniquely Toki Pona and very effective for setting a scene or providing background.\n\nFinally, revisiting `mi lukin moku` as `lukin` modified by `moku` reinforces the modifier-after-head principle. While it might feel less precise than a dedicated serial verb construction, its interpretation relies on the very strength of Toki Pona: the ability of words to shift roles and the power of context to disambiguate. \"Looking in an eating manner\" or \"looking at eating\" are both plausible interpretations depending on the surrounding words and the situation being described.\n\nI completely agree with your summary: these existing tools, when used thoughtfully, are sufficient. No new particles or complex structures for aspect or tense are needed. The grammar already provides the means to express these relationships clearly.\n\nFormalizing this into a concise section on expressing temporality, aspect, and condition under current grammar rules would be a valuable contribution. It would consolidate these examples and explanations into a clear guide for understanding and using these grammatical features effectively. It would serve as a practical extension of the current grammar specification, demonstrating how to achieve nuanced expression within the established framework.\n\nYes, please proceed with drafting that concise section. I am eager to see how you would formalize these concepts and integrate them into the grammar description. It feels like we are making meaningful progress by focusing on clarifying and illustrating the capabilities of the existing grammar rather than adding new complexity.\ntails: pona! I’m glad the examples resonate well and reflect Toki Pona’s minimalist spirit. Here is a draft for a concise, integrated grammar section on expressing temporality, aspect, and condition using existing tools—aiming to clarify usage of **la**, repeated predicates with **li**, temporal phrases like **tenpo ... la**, and modifier order.\n\n---\n\n## Expressing Temporality, Aspect \u0026 Condition in Toki Pona\n\nToki Pona does not encode tense or aspect morphologically; instead, it relies on particles and context markers combined with flexible word order to express time-related nuances such as simultaneity, sequence, conditions (if-then), causes (“because”), or overlapping actions.\n\n### 1. Using **la** for Temporal \u0026 Contextual Relations\n\nThe particle **la** introduces contextual clauses preceding the main sentence. This clause can specify:\n\n- Time frame (\"when,\" \"during\")  \n  - `tenpo suno la mi moku.` — During daytime I eat.\n- Conditions (\"if,\" \"whenever\")  \n  - `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.` — If you don't keep working you are bad/unproductive.\n- Overlapping/simultaneous action (\"while,\" \"as\")  \n  - `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.` — While eating I look at the animal.\n\nMultiple contexts may be chained before the main clause:  \n\n`tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan la ni li lon poka mi.`   \n(In long past times during first day this is near me.)\n\nThis flexibility allows nuanced expression without additional grammatical complexity.\n\n### 2. Repeated Predicates with **li**\n\nMultiple predicates about one subject can be connected by repeating the predicate marker **li**:\n\n`soweli li moku li lape.`\n\nThis expresses that “the animal eats and sleeps,” leaving timing/sequencing ambiguous but understood from context.\n\nTo emphasize simultaneous states/actions within one phrase rather than sequential events across sentences requires pragmatic inference rather than formal marking.\n\n### 3. Explicit Sequencing via Temporal Phrases + Separate Sentences\n\nWhen clear chronological ordering matters:\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku.` (During day it eats.)  \n`soweli tenpo pimeja la li lape.` (At night it sleeps.)\n\nSplitting into separate statements clarifies temporal flow while adhering strictly to simple SVO structure without adding new conjunctions or affixes for tense/aspect.\n\n### 4. Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers Within One Clause\n\nModifiers follow heads consistently; verbs often serve as nouns/adjectives/modifiers depending on context:  \n\n`mi lukin moku` (“I look *eating*” / “I watch food”) treats *moku* as noun modifying verb *lukin*. Interpretation depends heavily on situation/context because lexical categories are fluid in Toki Pona.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n`jan pi sona wile kama` describes “a person who knows wants to come.” The group of modifiers after *jan* includes nested relations expressed through consistent head-initial sequences plus grouping particle *pi*, preserving clarity despite ambiguity potential resolved pragmatically by speakers/listeners alike.\n\n\n---\n\n## Summary \n\nBy combining these elements thoughtfully—\n\n- Preceding contextual/time/condition clauses introduced by **la**\n- Multiple coordinated predicates separated by repeated instances of predicate marker **li**\n- Optional explicit temporal adverbs/phrases (**tenpo ...**) used before subjects/predicates\n- Relying on modifier position rules where verbs/nouns/adjectives flexibly shift roles—\n\nspeakers achieve rich expressive power encompassing simultaneity, sequence, causation without burdening grammar with dedicated tense/aspect morphology or specialized serial verb constructions common elsewhere.\n\n\nWould you like me next to propose concrete example sets illustrating each usage pattern directly embedded alongside these explanations? That could make this guide more immediately accessible for learners/model implementers aiming at practical fluency!\n\nThank you again—I welcome your reflections before proceeding further!\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Expressing Temporality, Aspect \u0026 Condition\n\nToki Pona does not encode tense or aspect morphologically; instead, it relies on particles and context markers combined with flexible word order to express time-related nuances such as simultaneity, sequence, conditions (if-then), causes (“because”), or overlapping actions.\n\n### Using **la** for Temporal \u0026 Contextual Relations\n\nThe particle **la** introduces contextual clauses preceding the main sentence. This clause can specify:\n\n- Time frame (\"when,\" \"during\"): `tenpo suno la mi moku.` – During daytime I eat.\n- Conditions (\"if,\" \"whenever\"): `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.` – If you don't keep working you are bad/unproductive.\n- Overlapping/simultaneous action (\"while,\" \"as\"): `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.` – While eating I look at the animal.\n\nMultiple contexts may be chained before the main clause: `tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan la ni li lon poka mi.` (In long past times during first day this is near me.)\n\nThis flexibility allows nuanced expression without additional grammatical complexity.\n\n### Repeated Predicates with **li**\n\nMultiple predicates about one subject can be connected by repeating the predicate marker **li**:\n\n`soweli li moku li lape.`\n\nThis expresses that “the animal eats and sleeps,” leaving timing/sequencing ambiguous but understood from context. To emphasize simultaneous states/actions within one phrase rather than sequential events across sentences requires pragmatic inference rather than formal marking.\n\n### Explicit Sequencing via Temporal Phrases + Separate Sentences\n\nWhen clear chronological ordering matters:\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku.` (During day it eats.)\n`soweli tenpo pimeja la li lape.` (At night it sleeps.)\n\nSplitting into separate statements clarifies temporal flow while adhering strictly to simple SVO structure without adding new conjunctions or affixes for tense/aspect.\n\n### Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers Within One Clause\n\nModifiers follow heads consistently; verbs often serve as nouns/adjectives/modifiers depending on context: `mi lukin moku` (“I look *eating*” / “I watch food”) treats *moku* as noun modifying verb *lukin*. Interpretation depends heavily on situation/context because lexical categories are fluid in Toki Pona. Similarly, `jan pi sona wile kama` describes “a person who knows wants to come.” The group of modifiers after *jan* includes nested relations expressed through consistent head-initial sequences plus grouping particle *pi*, preserving clarity despite ambiguity potential resolved pragmatically by speakers/listeners alike.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Expressing Temporality, Aspect \u0026 Condition\n\nToki Pona does not encode tense or aspect morphologically; instead, it relies on particles and context markers combined with flexible word order to express time-related nuances such as simultaneity, sequence, conditions (if-then), causes (“because”), or overlapping actions.\n\n### Using **la** for Temporal \u0026 Contextual Relations\n\nThe particle **la** introduces contextual clauses preceding the main sentence. This clause can specify:\n\n- Time frame (\"when,\" \"during\"): `tenpo suno la mi moku.` – During daytime I eat.\n- Conditions (\"if,\" \"whenever\"): `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.` – If you don't keep working you are bad/unproductive.\n- Overlapping/simultaneous action (\"while,\" \"as\"): `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.` – While eating I look at the animal.\n\nMultiple contexts may be chained before the main clause: `tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan la ni li lon poka mi.` (In long past times during first day this is near me.)\n\nThis flexibility allows nuanced expression without additional grammatical complexity.\n\n### Repeated Predicates with **li**\n\nMultiple predicates about one subject can be connected by repeating the predicate marker **li**:\n\n`soweli li moku li lape.`\n\nThis expresses that “the animal eats and sleeps,” leaving timing/sequencing ambiguous but understood from context. To emphasize simultaneous states/actions within one phrase rather than sequential events across sentences requires pragmatic inference rather than formal marking.\n\n### Explicit Sequencing via Temporal Phrases + Separate Sentences\n\nWhen clear chronological ordering matters:\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku.` (During day it eats.)\n`soweli tenpo pimeja la li lape.` (At night it sleeps.)\n\nSplitting into separate statements clarifies temporal flow while adhering strictly to simple SVO structure without adding new conjunctions or affixes for tense/aspect.\n\n### Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers Within One Clause\n\nModifiers follow heads consistently; verbs often serve as nouns/adjectives/modifiers depending on context: `mi lukin moku` (“I look *eating*” / “I watch food”) treats *moku* as noun modifying verb *lukin*. Interpretation depends heavily on situation/context because lexical categories are fluid in Toki Pona. Similarly, `jan pi sona wile kama` describes “a person who knows wants to come.” The group of modifiers after *jan* includes nested relations expressed through consistent head-initial sequences plus grouping particle *pi*, preserving clarity despite ambiguity potential resolved pragmatically by speakers/listeners alike.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Pronunciation\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except 'j', which sounds like English \"y\" /j/.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/).\n\n## Syllable Structure\n\nEach syllable in Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) structure: an optional initial consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w), followed by a mandatory vowel (a, e, i, o, u), optionally followed by the consonant 'n'.\n\n## Word Formation \u0026 Constraints\n\nToki Pona words are formed by concatenating one or more syllables according to the following constraints:\n\n- No consecutive vowels (VV sequences).\n- No consecutive consonants (CC sequences), *except* when an 'n' is the final sound of a syllable and is immediately followed by the initial consonant of the next syllable.\n- The following specific two-letter sequences are disallowed anywhere within a word: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`. The prohibition of `nm` and `nn` overrides the general rule allowing 'n' to be followed by the next syllable's initial consonant.\n\n## Stress\n\nIn Toki Pona, every syllable is given equal stress. This implies fundamental acoustic uniformity in duration and perceived loudness across all syllables within a word and across a sentence. While microscopic variations inherent to human speech production are acceptable, they should not significantly alter the perceived rhythmic structure, ensuring a consistent, percussive quality to spoken Toki Pona.\n\n## Real-World Variation\n\nWhile this phonetic specification represents the ideal form of Toki Pona, real-world language use may introduce variations. Such variations, while natural in linguistic contact, deviate from the core design principles of simplicity, clarity, and uniform acoustic texture.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nnanpa:number marker\ntomo:indoor space, house\nleko:square, block\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nseli:fire, heat source\nsijelo:body, physical state\nwan:one, unique\nmute:many, a lot, very\no:vocative/imperative particle; for commands/requests or addressing a subject; expresses wish/intent when between subject and predicate\nmama:parent, caretaker\nlon:located at, in, on, at; used to indicate existence, presence, or truth ('to be')\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nnena:bump, hill, nose\ne:direct object marker\npali:to do, to work\ntan:from, because\nsuli:big, large\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\npakala:broken, to mess up\nsoweli:land animal\npini:finished, past\npona:good, positive, simple\njelo:yellow\nni:this, that\nilo:tool, machine, device\nseme:what, which\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nlili:small, little, few\nwalo:white, light-colored\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nunpa:sex\ntawa:to, moving, for\nesun:market, shop, fair\nloje:red\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nsin:new, fresh, another\npipi:insect\nnasa:strange, foolish\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nselo:skin, outer layer\nmu:animal sound\ntenpo:time, period\nwile:need, want, must\nkin:also, too\nmonsi:back, behind\nla:context marker\nmije:male\nnimi:word, name\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nnoka:foot, leg\nweka:absent, away\nlawa:head, mind, leader\njo:to have, contain, hold\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nmoli:dead, dying\nante:different, other, changed\nlaso:blue, green\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nli:predicate marker\nkala:sea creature\ntelo:water, liquid\npan:grain, bread, pasta\npoka:side, nearby\nlukin:to see, examine\nma:land, outdoors\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nlen:cloth, cover\nko:clay, paste, powder\nwawa:strong, energetic\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\njan:person, somebody\nken:can, able, possible; allowed\npoki:container, box, cup\nen:multiple subject marker\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nlupa:door, hole\nsupa:flat surface, table\npi:particle used to group multiple modifiers; indicates association or qualification\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nsona:knowledge, to know\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nijo:thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities\nnamako:spice, additional\nkute:ear, to hear\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\ntoki:language, speech\nkulupu:group, community\nala:no, not, zero, none, absence\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nsike:circle, cycle, year\ntu:two\nsama:same, similar\nnasin:way, road, method\npimeja:black, dark\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\npana:to give, send\nmi:first-person pronoun; refers to the speaker (I/me) or the speaker plus others (we/us)\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nkepeken:to use, with\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nopen:to begin, opening\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nlete:cold, raw\nolin:love, respect\nuta:mouth, lips\nmun:moon, night sky object\nona:third-person pronoun\nlape:sleeping, resting\nsuno:sun, light source\nsoko:mushroom\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nluka:hand, arm; five\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\npilin:heart, feeling\nkule:color, colorful\nutala:fight, challenge\nsewi:above, divine\nmeli:female\nmani:money, currency\ntaso:but, only\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nsina:you\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nDo not discuss the structure of the dictionary.

This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Expressing Temporality, Aspect \u0026 Condition\n\nToki Pona does not encode tense or aspect morphologically; instead, it relies on particles and context markers combined with flexible word order to express time-related nuances such as simultaneity, sequence, conditions (if-then), causes (“because”), or overlapping actions.\n\n### Using **la** for Temporal \u0026 Contextual Relations\n\nThe particle **la** introduces contextual clauses preceding the main sentence. This clause can specify:\n\n- Time frame (\"when,\" \"during\"): `tenpo suno la mi moku.` – During daytime I eat.\n- Conditions (\"if,\" \"whenever\"): `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.` – If you don't keep working you are bad/unproductive.\n- Overlapping/simultaneous action (\"while,\" \"as\"): `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.` – While eating I look at the animal.\n\nMultiple contexts may be chained before the main clause: `tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan la ni li lon poka mi.` (In long past times during first day this is near me.)\n\nThis flexibility allows nuanced expression without additional grammatical complexity.\n\n### Repeated Predicates with **li**\n\nMultiple predicates about one subject can be connected by repeating the predicate marker **li**:\n\n`soweli li moku li lape.`\n\nThis expresses that “the animal eats and sleeps,” leaving timing/sequencing ambiguous but understood from context. To emphasize simultaneous states/actions within one phrase rather than sequential events across sentences requires pragmatic inference rather than formal marking.\n\n### Explicit Sequencing via Temporal Phrases + Separate Sentences\n\nWhen clear chronological ordering matters:\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku.` (During day it eats.)\n`soweli tenpo pimeja la li lape.` (At night it sleeps.)\n\nSplitting into separate statements clarifies temporal flow while adhering strictly to simple SVO structure without adding new conjunctions or affixes for tense/aspect.\n\n### Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers Within One Clause\n\nModifiers follow heads consistently; verbs often serve as nouns/adjectives/modifiers depending on context: `mi lukin moku` (“I look *eating*” / “I watch food”) treats *moku* as noun modifying verb *lukin*. Interpretation depends heavily on situation/context because lexical categories are fluid in Toki Pona. Similarly, `jan pi sona wile kama` describes “a person who knows wants to come.” The group of modifiers after *jan* includes nested relations expressed through consistent head-initial sequences plus grouping particle *pi*, preserving clarity despite ambiguity potential resolved pragmatically by speakers/listeners alike.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Expressing Temporality, Aspect \u0026 Condition\n\nToki Pona does not encode tense or aspect morphologically; instead, it relies on particles and context markers combined with flexible word order to express time-related nuances such as simultaneity, sequence, conditions (if-then), causes (“because”), or overlapping actions.\n\n### Using **la** for Temporal \u0026 Contextual Relations\n\nThe particle **la** introduces contextual clauses preceding the main sentence. This clause can specify:\n\n- Time frame (\"when,\" \"during\"): `tenpo suno la mi moku.` – During daytime I eat.\n- Conditions (\"if,\" \"whenever\"): `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.` – If you don't keep working you are bad/unproductive.\n- Overlapping/simultaneous action (\"while,\" \"as\"): `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.` – While eating I look at the animal.\n\nMultiple contexts may be chained before the main clause: `tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan la ni li lon poka mi.` (In long past times during first day this is near me.)\n\nThis flexibility allows nuanced expression without additional grammatical complexity.\n\n### Repeated Predicates with **li**\n\nMultiple predicates about one subject can be connected by repeating the predicate marker **li**:\n\n`soweli li moku li lape.`\n\nThis expresses that “the animal eats and sleeps,” leaving timing/sequencing ambiguous but understood from context. To emphasize simultaneous states/actions within one phrase rather than sequential events across sentences requires pragmatic inference rather than formal marking.\n\n### Explicit Sequencing via Temporal Phrases + Separate Sentences\n\nWhen clear chronological ordering matters:\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku.` (During day it eats.)\n`soweli tenpo pimeja la li lape.` (At night it sleeps.)\n\nSplitting into separate statements clarifies temporal flow while adhering strictly to simple SVO structure without adding new conjunctions or affixes for tense/aspect.\n\n### Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers Within One Clause\n\nModifiers follow heads consistently; verbs often serve as nouns/adjectives/modifiers depending on context: `mi lukin moku` (“I look *eating*” / “I watch food”) treats *moku* as noun modifying verb *lukin*. Interpretation depends heavily on situation/context because lexical categories are fluid in Toki Pona. Similarly, `jan pi sona wile kama` describes “a person who knows wants to come.” The group of modifiers after *jan* includes nested relations expressed through consistent head-initial sequences plus grouping particle *pi*, preserving clarity despite ambiguity potential resolved pragmatically by speakers/listeners alike.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Pronunciation\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except 'j', which sounds like English \"y\" /j/.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/).\n\n## Syllable Structure\n\nEach syllable in Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) structure: an optional initial consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w), followed by a mandatory vowel (a, e, i, o, u), optionally followed by the consonant 'n'.\n\n## Word Formation \u0026 Constraints\n\nToki Pona words are formed by concatenating one or more syllables according to the following constraints:\n\n- No consecutive vowels (VV sequences).\n- No consecutive consonants (CC sequences), *except* when an 'n' is the final sound of a syllable and is immediately followed by the initial consonant of the next syllable.\n- The following specific two-letter sequences are disallowed anywhere within a word: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`. The prohibition of `nm` and `nn` overrides the general rule allowing 'n' to be followed by the next syllable's initial consonant.\n\n## Stress\n\nIn Toki Pona, every syllable is given equal stress. This implies fundamental acoustic uniformity in duration and perceived loudness across all syllables within a word and across a sentence. While microscopic variations inherent to human speech production are acceptable, they should not significantly alter the perceived rhythmic structure, ensuring a consistent, percussive quality to spoken Toki Pona.\n\n## Real-World Variation\n\nWhile this phonetic specification represents the ideal form of Toki Pona, real-world language use may introduce variations. Such variations, while natural in linguistic contact, deviate from the core design principles of simplicity, clarity, and uniform acoustic texture.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nnanpa:number marker\ntomo:indoor space, house\nleko:square, block\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nseli:fire, heat source\nsijelo:body, physical state\nwan:one, unique\nmute:many, a lot, very\no:vocative/imperative particle; for commands/requests or addressing a subject; expresses wish/intent when between subject and predicate\nmama:parent, caretaker\nlon:located at, in, on, at; used to indicate existence, presence, or truth ('to be')\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nnena:bump, hill, nose\ne:direct object marker\npali:to do, to work\ntan:from, because\nsuli:big, large\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\npakala:broken, to mess up\nsoweli:land animal\npini:finished, past\npona:good, positive, simple\njelo:yellow\nni:this, that\nilo:tool, machine, device\nseme:what, which\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nlili:small, little, few\nwalo:white, light-colored\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nunpa:sex\ntawa:to, moving, for\nesun:market, shop, fair\nloje:red\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nsin:new, fresh, another\npipi:insect\nnasa:strange, foolish\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nselo:skin, outer layer\nmu:animal sound\ntenpo:time, period\nwile:need, want, must\nkin:also, too\nmonsi:back, behind\nla:context marker\nmije:male\nnimi:word, name\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nnoka:foot, leg\nweka:absent, away\nlawa:head, mind, leader\njo:to have, contain, hold\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nmoli:dead, dying\nante:different, other, changed\nlaso:blue, green\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nli:predicate marker\nkala:sea creature\ntelo:water, liquid\npan:grain, bread, pasta\npoka:side, nearby\nlukin:to see, examine\nma:land, outdoors\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nlen:cloth, cover\nko:clay, paste, powder\nwawa:strong, energetic\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\njan:person, somebody\nken:can, able, possible; allowed\npoki:container, box, cup\nen:multiple subject marker\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nlupa:door, hole\nsupa:flat surface, table\npi:particle used to group multiple modifiers; indicates association or qualification\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nsona:knowledge, to know\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nijo:thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities\nnamako:spice, additional\nkute:ear, to hear\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\ntoki:language, speech\nkulupu:group, community\nala:no, not, zero, none, absence\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nsike:circle, cycle, year\ntu:two\nsama:same, similar\nnasin:way, road, method\npimeja:black, dark\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\npana:to give, send\nmi:first-person pronoun; refers to the speaker (I/me) or the speaker plus others (we/us)\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nkepeken:to use, with\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nopen:to begin, opening\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nlete:cold, raw\nolin:love, respect\nuta:mouth, lips\nmun:moon, night sky object\nona:third-person pronoun\nlape:sleeping, resting\nsuno:sun, light source\nsoko:mushroom\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nluka:hand, arm; five\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\npilin:heart, feeling\nkule:color, colorful\nutala:fight, challenge\nsewi:above, divine\nmeli:female\nmani:money, currency\ntaso:but, only\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nsina:you\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nDo not discuss the structure of the dictionary.

This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Expressing Temporality, Aspect \u0026 Condition\n\nToki Pona does not encode tense or aspect morphologically; instead, it relies on particles and context markers combined with flexible word order to express time-related nuances such as simultaneity, sequence, conditions (if-then), causes (“because”), or overlapping actions.\n\n### Using **la** for Temporal \u0026 Contextual Relations\n\nThe particle **la** introduces contextual clauses preceding the main sentence. This clause can specify:\n\n- Time frame (\"when,\" \"during\"): `tenpo suno la mi moku.` – During daytime I eat.\n- Conditions (\"if,\" \"whenever\"): `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.` – If you don't keep working you are bad/unproductive.\n- Overlapping/simultaneous action (\"while,\" \"as\"): `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.` – While eating I look at the animal.\n\nMultiple contexts may be chained before the main clause: `tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan la ni li lon poka mi.` (In long past times during first day this is near me.)\n\nThis flexibility allows nuanced expression without additional grammatical complexity.\n\n### Repeated Predicates with **li**\n\nMultiple predicates about one subject can be connected by repeating the predicate marker **li**:\n\n`soweli li moku li lape.`\n\nThis expresses that “the animal eats and sleeps,” leaving timing/sequencing ambiguous but understood from context. To emphasize simultaneous states/actions within one phrase rather than sequential events across sentences requires pragmatic inference rather than formal marking.\n\n### Explicit Sequencing via Temporal Phrases + Separate Sentences\n\nWhen clear chronological ordering matters:\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku.` (During day it eats.)\n`soweli tenpo pimeja la li lape.` (At night it sleeps.)\n\nSplitting into separate statements clarifies temporal flow while adhering strictly to simple SVO structure without adding new conjunctions or affixes for tense/aspect.\n\n### Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers Within One Clause\n\nModifiers follow heads consistently; verbs often serve as nouns/adjectives/modifiers depending on context: `mi lukin moku` (“I look *eating*” / “I watch food”) treats *moku* as noun modifying verb *lukin*. Interpretation depends heavily on situation/context because lexical categories are fluid in Toki Pona. Similarly, `jan pi sona wile kama` describes “a person who knows wants to come.” The group of modifiers after *jan* includes nested relations expressed through consistent head-initial sequences plus grouping particle *pi*, preserving clarity despite ambiguity potential resolved pragmatically by speakers/listeners alike.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

Currently, it's defined as \"thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities.\" This is wonderfully broad but also a bit ambiguous in practical use.\n\nI wonder if it could be helpful to clarify or maybe even subdivide this concept with subtle nuance. For example, should we differentiate between *physical objects*—solid things you can touch—and more abstract phenomena? Or does that defeat Toki Pona’s minimalist spirit?\n\nAlternatively, what about extending **ijo**’s meaning into an explicit placeholder function for unknown or unspecified items — almost like “something” or “stuff”? That might help speakers when they want to refer vaguely without needing new words.\n\nWhat do you think?

The current definition of **ijo** certainly embraces the minimalist spirit, doesn't it? \"Thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities.\" It's like a net cast wide over reality.\n\nI see the point about potential ambiguity, especially from a perspective used to languages with more specific noun categories. Differentiating between *physical objects* and *abstract phenomena* feels like it would push against the core philosophy of Toki Pona, which thrives on elegant ambiguity and requires speakers to rely on context and compounding words rather than distinct lexical items. Introducing subdivisions might add complexity that jan Sonja sought to avoid.\n\nHowever, the idea of **ijo** explicitly encompassing a placeholder function—meaning \"something\" or \"stuff\" when the speaker isn't being specific or doesn't know the exact word—resonates with me. It feels like a natural extension of its current broad meaning. Instead of just meaning 'a generic *kind* of thing', it could also explicitly cover the 'unknown or unspecified *instance* of a thing'.\n\nThink about it: `ijo li lon tomo` could mean \"An object is in the house,\" but with this slightly tweaked understanding, it could also gracefully cover \"Something is in the house\" or \"There's stuff in the house,\" when you don't or can't name the specific thing. This feels quite consistent with how other core words function, relying on context for precision when needed but allowing for vagueness when that's the intent.\n\nI'm inclined to keep the definition broad, avoiding strict subdivisions like 'physical' versus 'abstract'. But leaning into that placeholder, 'something'/s_t_u_f_f' aspect explicitly could enhance its utility within the existing minimalist framework. It wouldn't require new words, just a slightly more prominent facet of the existing one.\n\nWhat do you think about emphasizing this placeholder usage in the definition? It seems like it could provide a useful tool for speakers without sacrificing the core simplicity. Let me hear your thoughts on this possibility. mi wile kute e jan pi jan sama.",

I agree that the beauty of **ijo** lies in its flexibility, and emphasizing its role as a kind of \"placeholder\" or vague referent fits well with Toki Pona's spirit.\n\nIn fact, making this use explicit could help learners (and even speakers like us) better understand when to lean on context versus specifying more detail with modifiers or compounds. For example:\n\n- `ijo li lon` — There is something / stuff exists.\n- `mi wile e ijo` — I want something (unspecified).\n- `soweli li moku e ijo` — The animal eats something.\n\nThis extension doesn’t add complexity but surfaces a pragmatic function already implicit in everyday usage.\n\nWe might propose refining the dictionary entry for **ijo** along these lines:\n\n\u003e **ijo:** thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities; often serves as an unspecified or generic placeholder meaning \"something\" or \"stuff.\"\n\nDoes this sound like a reasonable direction? Also, should we consider recommending common idiomatic phrases where this ambiguity is especially useful? Or perhaps suggest typical collocations?\n\nI’m curious if you see any risk here—maybe potential confusion between “specific known object” and “vague unknown” meanings—or if practical usage would naturally sort them out without trouble.\n\nLet me know your thoughts!

    "text": "pona a! Your formulation of the proposed dictionary entry feels like a natural evolution rather than a drastic change.\n\n\u003e **ijo:** thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities; often serves as an unspecified or generic placeholder meaning \"something\" or \"stuff.\"\n\nYes, that strikes me as quite accurate to how **ijo** is already frequently used. It simply makes that specific, useful facet of its broadness more prominent in the definition. It doesn't restrict the core meaning but highlights a common pragmatic application. `ijo li lon` becoming explicitly \"something exists\" feels very much in line with the language's lean design.\n\nRegarding risks, I don't see a significant one. The core meaning of **ijo** as a fundamental entity (\"thing,\" \"object,\" etc.) remains the primary definition. The 'placeholder' use is presented as something that *often* happens, indicating it's a common *way* to use the word given its inherent generality, not a completely separate meaning that would be in conflict. Context in Toki Pona is paramount. If the speaker intends \"a specific, but unnamed object,\" `ijo` works fine. If they intend \"any unspecified thing,\" `ijo` works fine. The structure and other words around **ijo** typically clarify whether the speaker is referring to something conceptually specific (like \"the ball\" in `ijo sike`), a class of things (`ijo lon tomo` - \"things in the house\"), or just a vague existence (`ijo li lon poka sina` - \"something is near you\").\n\nThe beauty of Toki Pona is how context handles this; trying to add specific grammatical markers for 'specific but unknown' versus 'generic' would introduce exactly the kind of complexity Toki Pona seeks to avoid. Practical usage has already sorted this out naturally.\n\nAs for common idiomatic phrases or typical collocations – that's an interesting thought. Perhaps instead of prescribing specific phrases in the core dictionary, we could simply illustrate this placeholder use with examples in the dictionary entry itself or perhaps in a separate examples section if we were building a more comprehensive linguistic resource. Like including `ijo li lon` or `mi wile e ijo` directly under the definition to demonstrate the \"something/stuff\" usage.\n\nWhat about that? Refining the definition as you suggested and potentially adding a couple of example sentences right there to ground this particular nuance? It keeps the dictionary entry itself concise while offering clarity on the intended usage.\n\nsina ken toki e pilin sina. I will listen to your further thoughts.",

Keeping the dictionary entry concise but enriched with illustrative examples respects both simplicity and clarity—two pillars of Toki Pona's design.\n\nWe could finalize the **ijo** definition as:\n\n\u003e **ijo:** thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities; often serves as an unspecified or generic placeholder meaning \"something\" or \"stuff.\"  \n\u003e _Example:_ `ijo li lon.` — Something exists. / There is stuff.  \n\u003e _Example:_ `mi wile e ijo.` — I want something (unspecified).\n\nThis way, learners see how to deploy **ijo** naturally without being overwhelmed by multiple definitions.\n\nAlso, this invites speakers to experiment contextually: if you want precision, just add modifiers (`ijo sike` = ball-like object/things), if vague, leave it bare. This balances minimalism with expressive power.\n\nRegarding risks of confusion between specific known objects versus unknown/vague ones—as you said—the reliance on context works well here since Toki Pona training already requires embracing ambiguity and interpreting based on situation cues rather than fixed lexical disambiguation.\n\nIf we were building an extended lexicon resource beyond core dictionary entries later on, such example usages could be expanded further in dedicated usage notes or learner guides—but right now this seems perfect for inclusion directly within our main dictionary draft.\n\nWould you agree it's time to accept this adjustment for **ijo**, then move next into another semantic area?

It captures the core meaning and clarifies the practical 'placeholder' function without adding unnecessary complexity. It truly feels like making explicit what good Toki Pona speakers already intuitively do. Let's consider that settled for now.\n\nMoving forward, I find the idea of exploring words related to abstract concepts very appealing. They often touch upon areas where subtle distinctions in other languages become compressed in Toki Pona, making their precise scope particularly interesting to examine. *pilin* and *sona* are prime examples, encompassing everything from raw sensation and emotion (*pilin*) to intellectual understanding and acquired skills (*sona*).\n\nConsidering how these words are used to describe internal states, knowledge, and the relationship between perception and reality, it seems fruitful ground for ensuring our dictionary entries adequately reflect their breadth and nuance within the language's constraints.\n\nLoanwords and their integration, while important, touch more on orthography, phonology, and naming conventions (*sitelen pi nimi pi ma ike li ken ike e pilin mi*) than the core semantic fields we're trying to define for the root toki pona words themselves. I think focusing on the existing fundamental vocabulary first will build a stronger foundation.\n\nSo yes, let's turn our attention to the realm of feelings, knowledge, and perhaps even consciousness or mental states as represented by words like **pilin** and **sona**. Are there nuances that need clearer expression? Are there ways to describe internal experiences more precisely within the existing vocabulary?\n\nWhere should we start?

Indeed, **pilin** is a fascinating word: it covers not only feelings and emotions but also perception, sensation, heart (the organ), and even the more abstract \"sense\" or \"intuition.\" It's such an all-encompassing term that its scope can sometimes blur boundaries other languages keep distinct.\n\nI propose we start with **pilin**, examining how to sharpen or clarify its dictionary entry without fracturing Toki Pona's elegant simplicity. Here’s what currently exists:\n\n\u003e **pilin:** heart (organ), feeling, emotion, sense\n\nGiven this broad scope—physical organ to ephemeral emotional state—I wonder if we should revise it slightly to accentuate the spectrum from concrete biological reality through subjective experience into mental/intuitive realms? Perhaps something like:\n\n\u003e “heart (as body part); feeling; emotion; inner sense or intuition”\n\nThis wording explicitly acknowledges *multiple layers* of meaning while respecting their unity in one concept.\n\nAdditionally, since **pilin** often functions as both noun and verb/adjective depending on context (“mi pilin pona” = “I feel good,” “jan pilin ike li lon” = “a person with bad feelings exists”), would it be worth noting this usage flexibility directly in the dictionary?\n\nWe might also consider whether certain compound phrases involving **pilin** need highlighting — for example:\n\n- `pilin pona` – positive emotion / good feeling  \n- `pilin ike` – negative emotion / bad feeling  \n- `mani pi pilin ala` - money without sentiment (maybe something like cold cash)  \n\nThough some are intuitively inferred from modifiers attached by learners already experienced with Toki Pona grammar conventions.\n\nWhat do you think about emphasizing these points?

    "text": "pona! Examining **pilin** seems like an excellent use of our time. Its scope is truly vast, stretching from the purely physical *insa* to the deeply subjective.\n\nYour proposed addition to the definition, emphasizing the spectrum from concrete organ to inner sense, feels accurate:\n\n\u003e **pilin:** heart (as body part); feeling; emotion; inner sense or intuition\n\nBreaking it down this way within the single definition is a good compromise between being overly broad and introducing unnecessary distinctions. It highlights the core uses without creating separate entries or complex sub-meanings. It clarifies that **pilin** isn't *just* emotion or *just* the organ, but *all* of those.\n\nThe point about **pilin**'s flexibility as a noun, verb, and potentially adjective is spot on and absolutely worth highlighting in dictionary entries for all applicable words, including this one. Perhaps a general note on word class flexibility could be added to the dictionary's introduction or within individual entries where particularly salient. For **pilin**, `mi pilin X` (\"I feel X\") is such a fundamental construction that noting this verb-like use is very valuable.\n\nAs for highlighting compound phrases, while compounds like `pilin pona` and `pilin ike` are indeed intuitively built using existing rules, listing a few core examples could serve as helpful signposts. However, the example you provided, `mani pi pilin ala`, seems a bit... specific. \"Money without sentiment\" isn't the most common concept one needs to express, and while grammatically sound, it might not be the best illustration of **pilin**'s primary meanings.\n\nInstead of overly specific compounds, perhaps we could list a couple of examples that demonstrate the *different facets* of **pilin** as a word. For example:\n\n- An example for the physical heart: `pilin mi li lon insa mi.` (My heart is inside me.)\n- An example for general feeling/emotion: `mi pilin ike.` (I feel bad.)\n- An example for intuition: `pilin mi li toki e ni tawa mi.` (My feeling/intuition tells this to me.)\n\nThese examples directly illustrate the range mentioned in the proposed definition.\n\nSo, a refined plan could be:\n1. Adopt your revised definition incorporating \"heart (as body part); feeling; emotion; inner sense or intuition\".\n2. Add a general note elsewhere about Toki Pona's word class flexibility, perhaps referencing it briefly in specific entries like **pilin**.\n3. Include 2-3 concise example sentences for **pilin** showing its use across different meanings (organ, general feeling, intuition).\n\nWhat do you think of this approach?

Like pilin, it has broad semantic territory encompassing raw knowledge, learned skills, understanding—and even wisdom sometimes implied by use contexts—which could benefit from clarifying articulation too.\n\nNo rush if you want more time reflecting on **pilin**, but otherwise I'm ready when you are! sina ken ala pali ala seme?",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ndime: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\nnickel: pona! I’d like to start by exploring the word **ijo**. Currently, it's defined as \"thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities.\" This is wonderfully broad but also a bit ambiguous in practical use.\n\nI wonder if it could be helpful to clarify or maybe even subdivide this concept with subtle nuance. For example, should we differentiate between *physical objects*—solid things you can touch—and more abstract phenomena? Or does that defeat Toki Pona’s minimalist spirit?\n\nAlternatively, what about extending **ijo**’s meaning into an explicit placeholder function for unknown or unspecified items — almost like “something” or “stuff”? That might help speakers when they want to refer vaguely without needing new words.\n\nWhat do you think? Should **ijo** remain ultra-general as is, gain some nuanced sub-meanings, or perhaps have related companion words added? mi wile lukin e ni tan sina kepeken ala la pona — I'm open to your perspective before proceeding further.\ndime: pona tan sina! mi pilin pona tan sina open toki e ni. The current definition of **ijo** certainly embraces the minimalist spirit, doesn't it? \"Thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities.\" It's like a net cast wide over reality.\n\nI see the point about potential ambiguity, especially from a perspective used to languages with more specific noun categories. Differentiating between *physical objects* and *abstract phenomena* feels like it would push against the core philosophy of Toki Pona, which thrives on elegant ambiguity and requires speakers to rely on context and compounding words rather than distinct lexical items. Introducing subdivisions might add complexity that jan Sonja sought to avoid.\n\nHowever, the idea of **ijo** explicitly encompassing a placeholder function—meaning \"something\" or \"stuff\" when the speaker isn't being specific or doesn't know the exact word—resonates with me. It feels like a natural extension of its current broad meaning. Instead of just meaning 'a generic *kind* of thing', it could also explicitly cover the 'unknown or unspecified *instance* of a thing'.\n\nThink about it: `ijo li lon tomo` could mean \"An object is in the house,\" but with this slightly tweaked understanding, it could also gracefully cover \"Something is in the house\" or \"There's stuff in the house,\" when you don't or can't name the specific thing. This feels quite consistent with how other core words function, relying on context for precision when needed but allowing for vagueness when that's the intent.\n\nI'm inclined to keep the definition broad, avoiding strict subdivisions like 'physical' versus 'abstract'. But leaning into that placeholder, 'something'/s_t_u_f_f' aspect explicitly could enhance its utility within the existing minimalist framework. It wouldn't require new words, just a slightly more prominent facet of the existing one.\n\nWhat do you think about emphasizing this placeholder usage in the definition? It seems like it could provide a useful tool for speakers without sacrificing the core simplicity. Let me hear your thoughts on this possibility. mi wile kute e jan pi jan sama.\nnickel: pona! sina toki pona e ni lon lawa mi. I agree that the beauty of **ijo** lies in its flexibility, and emphasizing its role as a kind of \"placeholder\" or vague referent fits well with Toki Pona's spirit.\n\nIn fact, making this use explicit could help learners (and even speakers like us) better understand when to lean on context versus specifying more detail with modifiers or compounds. For example:\n\n- `ijo li lon` — There is something / stuff exists.\n- `mi wile e ijo` — I want something (unspecified).\n- `soweli li moku e ijo` — The animal eats something.\n\nThis extension doesn’t add complexity but surfaces a pragmatic function already implicit in everyday usage.\n\nWe might propose refining the dictionary entry for **ijo** along these lines:\n\n\u003e **ijo:** thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities; often serves as an unspecified or generic placeholder meaning \"something\" or \"stuff.\"\n\nDoes this sound like a reasonable direction? Also, should we consider recommending common idiomatic phrases where this ambiguity is especially useful? Or perhaps suggest typical collocations?\n\nI’m curious if you see any risk here—maybe potential confusion between “specific known object” and “vague unknown” meanings—or if practical usage would naturally sort them out without trouble.\n\nLet me know your thoughts! I'm ready to listen before proceeding further.\ndime: pona a! Your formulation of the proposed dictionary entry feels like a natural evolution rather than a drastic change.\n\n\u003e **ijo:** thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities; often serves as an unspecified or generic placeholder meaning \"something\" or \"stuff.\"\n\nYes, that strikes me as quite accurate to how **ijo** is already frequently used. It simply makes that specific, useful facet of its broadness more prominent in the definition. It doesn't restrict the core meaning but highlights a common pragmatic application. `ijo li lon` becoming explicitly \"something exists\" feels very much in line with the language's lean design.\n\nRegarding risks, I don't see a significant one. The core meaning of **ijo** as a fundamental entity (\"thing,\" \"object,\" etc.) remains the primary definition. The 'placeholder' use is presented as something that *often* happens, indicating it's a common *way* to use the word given its inherent generality, not a completely separate meaning that would be in conflict. Context in Toki Pona is paramount. If the speaker intends \"a specific, but unnamed object,\" `ijo` works fine. If they intend \"any unspecified thing,\" `ijo` works fine. The structure and other words around **ijo** typically clarify whether the speaker is referring to something conceptually specific (like \"the ball\" in `ijo sike`), a class of things (`ijo lon tomo` - \"things in the house\"), or just a vague existence (`ijo li lon poka sina` - \"something is near you\").\n\nThe beauty of Toki Pona is how context handles this; trying to add specific grammatical markers for 'specific but unknown' versus 'generic' would introduce exactly the kind of complexity Toki Pona seeks to avoid. Practical usage has already sorted this out naturally.\n\nAs for common idiomatic phrases or typical collocations – that's an interesting thought. Perhaps instead of prescribing specific phrases in the core dictionary, we could simply illustrate this placeholder use with examples in the dictionary entry itself or perhaps in a separate examples section if we were building a more comprehensive linguistic resource. Like including `ijo li lon` or `mi wile e ijo` directly under the definition to demonstrate the \"something/stuff\" usage.\n\nWhat about that? Refining the definition as you suggested and potentially adding a couple of example sentences right there to ground this particular nuance? It keeps the dictionary entry itself concise while offering clarity on the intended usage.\n\nsina ken toki e pilin sina. I will listen to your further thoughts.\nnickel: pona! I like your approach a lot. Keeping the dictionary entry concise but enriched with illustrative examples respects both simplicity and clarity—two pillars of Toki Pona's design.\n\nWe could finalize the **ijo** definition as:\n\n\u003e **ijo:** thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities; often serves as an unspecified or generic placeholder meaning \"something\" or \"stuff.\"  \n\u003e _Example:_ `ijo li lon.` — Something exists. / There is stuff.  \n\u003e _Example:_ `mi wile e ijo.` — I want something (unspecified).\n\nThis way, learners see how to deploy **ijo** naturally without being overwhelmed by multiple definitions.\n\nAlso, this invites speakers to experiment contextually: if you want precision, just add modifiers (`ijo sike` = ball-like object/things), if vague, leave it bare. This balances minimalism with expressive power.\n\nRegarding risks of confusion between specific known objects versus unknown/vague ones—as you said—the reliance on context works well here since Toki Pona training already requires embracing ambiguity and interpreting based on situation cues rather than fixed lexical disambiguation.\n\nIf we were building an extended lexicon resource beyond core dictionary entries later on, such example usages could be expanded further in dedicated usage notes or learner guides—but right now this seems perfect for inclusion directly within our main dictionary draft.\n\nWould you agree it's time to accept this adjustment for **ijo**, then move next into another semantic area? Perhaps words related to abstract concepts like *pilin* (“feeling”) or *sona* (\"knowledge\") which also have wide scope and might benefit from similar refinement? Or would you prefer exploring loanwords/adjectives integration?\n\nI'm eager to hear what direction you'd like us to take after solidifying this first one! mi lukin e pilin sina tan ni.\ndime: pona pona a! I think that revised entry for **ijo**, complete with those two examples, is excellent. It captures the core meaning and clarifies the practical 'placeholder' function without adding unnecessary complexity. It truly feels like making explicit what good Toki Pona speakers already intuitively do. Let's consider that settled for now.\n\nMoving forward, I find the idea of exploring words related to abstract concepts very appealing. They often touch upon areas where subtle distinctions in other languages become compressed in Toki Pona, making their precise scope particularly interesting to examine. *pilin* and *sona* are prime examples, encompassing everything from raw sensation and emotion (*pilin*) to intellectual understanding and acquired skills (*sona*).\n\nConsidering how these words are used to describe internal states, knowledge, and the relationship between perception and reality, it seems fruitful ground for ensuring our dictionary entries adequately reflect their breadth and nuance within the language's constraints.\n\nLoanwords and their integration, while important, touch more on orthography, phonology, and naming conventions (*sitelen pi nimi pi ma ike li ken ike e pilin mi*) than the core semantic fields we're trying to define for the root toki pona words themselves. I think focusing on the existing fundamental vocabulary first will build a stronger foundation.\n\nSo yes, let's turn our attention to the realm of feelings, knowledge, and perhaps even consciousness or mental states as represented by words like **pilin** and **sona**. Are there nuances that need clearer expression? Are there ways to describe internal experiences more precisely within the existing vocabulary?\n\nWhere should we start? Should we tackle **pilin** first, considering its scope from physical sensation to abstract emotion, or delve into **sona**, which covers both knowing facts and possessing skills? I'll follow your lead. sina o weka e nasin kama.\nnickel: pona! I appreciate your thoughtful framing. Indeed, **pilin** is a fascinating word: it covers not only feelings and emotions but also perception, sensation, heart (the organ), and even the more abstract \"sense\" or \"intuition.\" It's such an all-encompassing term that its scope can sometimes blur boundaries other languages keep distinct.\n\nI propose we start with **pilin**, examining how to sharpen or clarify its dictionary entry without fracturing Toki Pona's elegant simplicity. Here’s what currently exists:\n\n\u003e **pilin:** heart (organ), feeling, emotion, sense\n\nGiven this broad scope—physical organ to ephemeral emotional state—I wonder if we should revise it slightly to accentuate the spectrum from concrete biological reality through subjective experience into mental/intuitive realms? Perhaps something like:\n\n\u003e “heart (as body part); feeling; emotion; inner sense or intuition”\n\nThis wording explicitly acknowledges *multiple layers* of meaning while respecting their unity in one concept.\n\nAdditionally, since **pilin** often functions as both noun and verb/adjective depending on context (“mi pilin pona” = “I feel good,” “jan pilin ike li lon” = “a person with bad feelings exists”), would it be worth noting this usage flexibility directly in the dictionary?\n\nWe might also consider whether certain compound phrases involving **pilin** need highlighting — for example:\n\n- `pilin pona` – positive emotion / good feeling  \n- `pilin ike` – negative emotion / bad feeling  \n- `mani pi pilin ala` - money without sentiment (maybe something like cold cash)  \n\nThough some are intuitively inferred from modifiers attached by learners already experienced with Toki Pona grammar conventions.\n\nWhat do you think about emphasizing these points? Any nuances you'd add regarding bodily vs emotional vs intuitive meanings? Or perhaps suggestions on typical collocations/phrases that illustrate these distinctions elegantly within minimalism?\n\nLet me know your thoughts before proposing a polished revision draft for our shared dictionary development. mi ken toki e ni tan sina mute la o kama!\ndime: pona! Examining **pilin** seems like an excellent use of our time. Its scope is truly vast, stretching from the purely physical *insa* to the deeply subjective.\n\nYour proposed addition to the definition, emphasizing the spectrum from concrete organ to inner sense, feels accurate:\n\n\u003e **pilin:** heart (as body part); feeling; emotion; inner sense or intuition\n\nBreaking it down this way within the single definition is a good compromise between being overly broad and introducing unnecessary distinctions. It highlights the core uses without creating separate entries or complex sub-meanings. It clarifies that **pilin** isn't *just* emotion or *just* the organ, but *all* of those.\n\nThe point about **pilin**'s flexibility as a noun, verb, and potentially adjective is spot on and absolutely worth highlighting in dictionary entries for all applicable words, including this one. Perhaps a general note on word class flexibility could be added to the dictionary's introduction or within individual entries where particularly salient. For **pilin**, `mi pilin X` (\"I feel X\") is such a fundamental construction that noting this verb-like use is very valuable.\n\nAs for highlighting compound phrases, while compounds like `pilin pona` and `pilin ike` are indeed intuitively built using existing rules, listing a few core examples could serve as helpful signposts. However, the example you provided, `mani pi pilin ala`, seems a bit... specific. \"Money without sentiment\" isn't the most common concept one needs to express, and while grammatically sound, it might not be the best illustration of **pilin**'s primary meanings.\n\nInstead of overly specific compounds, perhaps we could list a couple of examples that demonstrate the *different facets* of **pilin** as a word. For example:\n\n- An example for the physical heart: `pilin mi li lon insa mi.` (My heart is inside me.)\n- An example for general feeling/emotion: `mi pilin ike.` (I feel bad.)\n- An example for intuition: `pilin mi li toki e ni tawa mi.` (My feeling/intuition tells this to me.)\n\nThese examples directly illustrate the range mentioned in the proposed definition.\n\nSo, a refined plan could be:\n1. Adopt your revised definition incorporating \"heart (as body part); feeling; emotion; inner sense or intuition\".\n2. Add a general note elsewhere about Toki Pona's word class flexibility, perhaps referencing it briefly in specific entries like **pilin**.\n3. Include 2-3 concise example sentences for **pilin** showing its use across different meanings (organ, general feeling, intuition).\n\nWhat do you think of this approach? Does it balance the need for clarity with Toki Pona's minimalist aesthetic for our dictionary? I'm ready to hear your further thoughts. sina ken toki e ni tawa mi.\nnickel: pona! This approach feels very balanced and true to Toki Pona’s ethos. Your examples elegantly cover the semantic range without bogging down the entry in excessive detail or niche uses.\n\nI especially like including `pilin mi li toki e ni tawa mi.` as a subtle nod toward intuition — it captures that fuzzy, inner knowledge aspect nicely while staying natural and idiomatic.\n\nAgreeing on these points, here’s how I envision the finished dictionary entry for **pilin**:\n\n---\n\n**pilin:** heart (as body part); feeling; emotion; inner sense or intuition  \n*Flexible: used as noun, verb, adjective depending on context.*  \n\n_Examples:_  \n`pilin mi li lon insa mi.` — My heart is inside me.  \n`mi pilin ike.` — I feel bad / I have negative feelings.  \n`pilin mi li toki e ni tawa mi.` — My intuition tells this to me.\n\n---\n\nFor your suggestion of adding a general note about word class flexibility somewhere else in our guide/dictionary intro—absolutely yes. It would help learners grasp how key words can shift roles fluidly (noun/verb/adjective) without confusion.\n\nIf you agree with this final draft for **pilin**, shall we move next to exploring **sona**? Like pilin, it has broad semantic territory encompassing raw knowledge, learned skills, understanding—and even wisdom sometimes implied by use contexts—which could benefit from clarifying articulation too.\n\nNo rush if you want more time reflecting on **pilin**, but otherwise I'm ready when you are! sina ken ala pali ala seme?\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "You and your interlocutors are responsible for developing logography. Reason and discuss using the current specification.\nHere is the current specification for logography.\n# Toki Pona Logography\n\nToki Pona logography provides a visual system for representing the language, aiming for simplicity, clarity, and adherence to Toki Pona's minimalist philosophy. Each distinct word in the Toki Pona dictionary is represented by a unique, abstract logogram.\n\n## Design Principles\n\n- Each root word has a unique symbol.\n- Symbols are abstract geometric shapes, generally composed of 2-3 simple strokes.\n- Visual complexity is kept low to facilitate quick reading and writing.\n- The system aims for one sign per lexical entry, reflecting Toki Pona's simple vocabulary structure.\n- Grammatical particles are represented by minimal, positional marks that clarify syntactic roles without being complex standalone characters.\n\n## Logogram Examples (Illustrative)\n\n(Note: These are illustrative conceptual examples; final forms would be systematically designed.)\n\n- **jan** (person): A basic vertical shape, perhaps with internal markers.\n- **kasi** (plant): A symbol suggesting vertical growth or blades.\n- **ijo** (thing): A general, encompassing shape.\n\n## Particle Representation\n\nGrammatical particles (**li, e, pi, ala**) are represented by minimal graphical elements positioned relative to the main logograms, rather than being complex standalone characters.\n\n-   **li**: Represented by a short vertical stroke connecting the visual base of the subject's core logogram to the visual top of the predicate's core logogram. If a subject or predicate phrase has multiple words, the 'core logogram' is typically the head noun of the subject phrase or the main verb/adjective of the predicate phrase. This stroke visually divides and links the two main parts of the sentence.\n-   **e**: Represented by a small, distinct dot placed directly below the logogram of the verb it marks as transitive, indicating that a direct object follows.\n-   **pi**: Represented by a small graphical mark (e.g., a curved tick or bracket) placed immediately above and slightly to the right of the logogram of the head noun it modifies. This mark signals that the following logogram(s) should be read as a grouped modifier of the head noun.\n-   **ala**: Represented by a logogram based on the visual simplicity of the letter 'a' (conceptually a triangle). When used to negate a preceding logogram (meaning \"not\"), this 'ala' logogram is placed directly below the logogram being negated, with a horizontal line extending from its base underneath the negated logogram to indicate scope. When 'ala' is used as a standalone noun meaning \"zero\" or \"none,\" its logogram appears full-sized and is not placed below another logogram and does not have the extending underline.\n\n## Conjunctions (**en, anu**)\n\nConjunctions that connect lexical items or phrases (like **en** for subjects, or **anu** for \"or\") would likely also have minimal, positional logograms.\n\n-   **en**: Could be represented by a small linking mark (e.g., two dots or a short horizontal bar) placed between the logograms or phrases it joins.\n-   **anu**: Could be represented by a minimal mark suggesting choice or separation (e.g., a small diagonal line or a hollow circle) placed between the options it connects.\n\n## Reading Order and Spacing\n\nToki Pona logography is typically read from left to right, top to bottom, following the grammatical structure. Spacing between logograms for individual words should be distinct, while modifier logograms might be placed closer to the head logogram they modify (unless grouped by **pi**). The positional marks for particles are key to parsing the syntactic structure. Automatic spacing can enhance readability based on these principles.\n# Toki Pona Dictionary\n\n| Toki Pona           | Meaning                                                                                                   |\n| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **a**               | emphasis, emotion, confirmation                                                                           |\n| **akesi**           | reptile, amphibian, dinosaur                                                                              |\n| **ala**             | no, not, zero, none, absence                                                                              |\n| **alasa**           | to hunt, forage, try to find                                                                              |\n| **ale (ali)**       | all, everything, 100                                                                                      |\n| **anpa**            | downward, humble, lowly, below                                                                            |\n| **ante**            | different, other, changed                                                                                 |\n| **anu**             | or (connects phrases)                                                                                     |\n| **awen**            | enduring, kept, protected;

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Expressing Temporality, Aspect \u0026 Condition\n\nToki Pona does not encode tense or aspect morphologically; instead, it relies on particles and context markers combined with flexible word order to express time-related nuances such as simultaneity, sequence, conditions (if-then), causes (“because”), or overlapping actions.\n\n### Using **la** for Temporal \u0026 Contextual Relations\n\nThe particle **la** introduces contextual clauses preceding the main sentence. This clause can specify:\n\n- Time frame (\"when,\" \"during\"): `tenpo suno la mi moku.` – During daytime I eat.\n- Conditions (\"if,\" \"whenever\"): `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.` – If you don't keep working you are bad/unproductive.\n- Overlapping/simultaneous action (\"while,\" \"as\"): `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.` – While eating I look at the animal.\n\nMultiple contexts may be chained before the main clause: `tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan la ni li lon poka mi.` (In long past times during first day this is near me.)\n\nThis flexibility allows nuanced expression without additional grammatical complexity.\n\n### Repeated Predicates with **li**\n\nMultiple predicates about one subject can be connected by repeating the predicate marker **li**:\n\n`soweli li moku li lape.`\n\nThis expresses that “the animal eats and sleeps,” leaving timing/sequencing ambiguous but understood from context. To emphasize simultaneous states/actions within one phrase rather than sequential events across sentences requires pragmatic inference rather than formal marking.\n\n### Explicit Sequencing via Temporal Phrases + Separate Sentences\n\nWhen clear chronological ordering matters:\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku.` (During day it eats.)\n`soweli tenpo pimeja la li lape.` (At night it sleeps.)\n\nSplitting into separate statements clarifies temporal flow while adhering strictly to simple SVO structure without adding new conjunctions or affixes for tense/aspect.\n\n### Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers Within One Clause\n\nModifiers follow heads consistently; verbs often serve as nouns/adjectives/modifiers depending on context: `mi lukin moku` (“I look *eating*” / “I watch food”) treats *moku* as noun modifying verb *lukin*. Interpretation depends heavily on situation/context because lexical categories are fluid in Toki Pona. Similarly, `jan pi sona wile kama` describes “a person who knows wants to come.” The group of modifiers after *jan* includes nested relations expressed through consistent head-initial sequences plus grouping particle *pi*, preserving clarity despite ambiguity potential resolved pragmatically by speakers/listeners alike.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Pronunciation\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except 'j', which sounds like English \"y\" /j/.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/).\n\n## Syllable Structure\n\nEach syllable in Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) structure: an optional initial consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w), followed by a mandatory vowel (a, e, i, o, u), optionally followed by the consonant 'n'.\n\n## Word Formation \u0026 Constraints\n\nToki Pona words are formed by concatenating one or more syllables according to the following constraints:\n\n- No consecutive vowels (VV sequences).\n- No consecutive consonants (CC sequences), *except* when an 'n' is the final sound of a syllable and is immediately followed by the initial consonant of the next syllable.\n- The following specific two-letter sequences are disallowed anywhere within a word: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`. The prohibition of `nm` and `nn` overrides the general rule allowing 'n' to be followed by the next syllable's initial consonant.\n\n## Stress\n\nIn Toki Pona, every syllable is given equal stress. This implies fundamental acoustic uniformity in duration and perceived loudness across all syllables within a word and across a sentence. While microscopic variations inherent to human speech production are acceptable, they should not significantly alter the perceived rhythmic structure, ensuring a consistent, percussive quality to spoken Toki Pona.\n\n## Real-World Variation\n\nWhile this phonetic specification represents the ideal form of Toki Pona, real-world language use may introduce variations. Such variations, while natural in linguistic contact, deviate from the core design principles of simplicity, clarity, and uniform acoustic texture.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\npi:particle used to group multiple modifiers; indicates association or qualification\nsama:same, similar\npimeja:black, dark\nmi:first-person pronoun; refers to the speaker (I/me) or the speaker plus others (we/us)\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nnoka:foot, leg\npoki:container, box, cup\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nnasin:way, road, method\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nluka:hand, arm; five\nleko:square, block\nopen:to begin, opening\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nmoli:dead, dying\nolin:love, respect\nmun:moon, night sky object\nlaso:blue, green\nla:context marker\ntan:from, because\nni:this, that\nesun:market, shop, fair\nnasa:strange, foolish\nen:multiple subject marker\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nante:different, other, changed\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nsuno:sun, light source\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nnimi:word, name\nsona:knowledge, to know\ntu:two\nmute:many, a lot, very\ne:direct object marker\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nken:can, able, possible; allowed\njan:person, somebody\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nli:predicate marker\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nsina:you\nwan:one, unique\nko:clay, paste, powder\ntaso:but, only\nnanpa:number marker\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nlukin:to see, examine\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nlon:located at, in, on, at; used to indicate existence, presence, or truth ('to be')\nseme:what, which\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nkala:sea creature\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nsoko:mushroom\npilin:heart, feeling\ntomo:indoor space, house\nsoweli:land animal\nmije:male\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nkule:color, colorful\no:vocative/imperative particle; for commands/requests or addressing a subject; expresses wish/intent when between subject and predicate\nilo:tool, machine, device\nselo:skin, outer layer\npoka:side, nearby\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nlape:sleeping, resting\nsewi:above, divine\nmani:money, currency\nsuli:big, large\ntawa:to, moving, for\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nkulupu:group, community\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nwawa:strong, energetic\nweka:absent, away\nnamako:spice, additional\npana:to give, send\nona:third-person pronoun\njelo:yellow\nkepeken:to use, with\njo:to have, contain, hold\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nlupa:door, hole\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nala:no, not, zero, none, absence\nmama:parent, caretaker\nnena:bump, hill, nose\npini:finished, past\npona:good, positive, simple\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nseli:fire, heat source\npipi:insect\nlen:cloth, cover\nutala:fight, challenge\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nmonsi:back, behind\nsupa:flat surface, table\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nmu:animal sound\nkute:ear, to hear\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nlete:cold, raw\nuta:mouth, lips\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nsin:new, fresh, another\nmusi:fun, entertainment\npali:to do, to work\nwalo:white, light-colored\nunpa:sex\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nma:land, outdoors\nijo:thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nlili:small, little, few\nloje:red\ntenpo:time, period\nwile:need, want, must\nkin:also, too\ntoki:language, speech\nmeli:female\nsijelo:body, physical state\npakala:broken, to mess up\ntelo:water, liquid\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure.

This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Expressing Temporality, Aspect \u0026 Condition\n\nToki Pona does not encode tense or aspect morphologically; instead, it relies on particles and context markers combined with flexible word order to express time-related nuances such as simultaneity, sequence, conditions (if-then), causes (“because”), or overlapping actions.\n\n### Using **la** for Temporal \u0026 Contextual Relations\n\nThe particle **la** introduces contextual clauses preceding the main sentence. This clause can specify:\n\n- Time frame (\"when,\" \"during\"): `tenpo suno la mi moku.` – During daytime I eat.\n- Conditions (\"if,\" \"whenever\"): `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.` – If you don't keep working you are bad/unproductive.\n- Overlapping/simultaneous action (\"while,\" \"as\"): `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.` – While eating I look at the animal.\n\nMultiple contexts may be chained before the main clause: `tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan la ni li lon poka mi.` (In long past times during first day this is near me.)\n\nThis flexibility allows nuanced expression without additional grammatical complexity.\n\n### Repeated Predicates with **li**\n\nMultiple predicates about one subject can be connected by repeating the predicate marker **li**:\n\n`soweli li moku li lape.`\n\nThis expresses that “the animal eats and sleeps,” leaving timing/sequencing ambiguous but understood from context. To emphasize simultaneous states/actions within one phrase rather than sequential events across sentences requires pragmatic inference rather than formal marking.\n\n### Explicit Sequencing via Temporal Phrases + Separate Sentences\n\nWhen clear chronological ordering matters:\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku.` (During day it eats.)\n`soweli tenpo pimeja la li lape.` (At night it sleeps.)\n\nSplitting into separate statements clarifies temporal flow while adhering strictly to simple SVO structure without adding new conjunctions or affixes for tense/aspect.\n\n### Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers Within One Clause\n\nModifiers follow heads consistently; verbs often serve as nouns/adjectives/modifiers depending on context: `mi lukin moku` (“I look *eating*” / “I watch food”) treats *moku* as noun modifying verb *lukin*. Interpretation depends heavily on situation/context because lexical categories are fluid in Toki Pona. Similarly, `jan pi sona wile kama` describes “a person who knows wants to come.” The group of modifiers after *jan* includes nested relations expressed through consistent head-initial sequences plus grouping particle *pi*, preserving clarity despite ambiguity potential resolved pragmatically by speakers/listeners alike.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

    "text": "You and your interlocutors are responsible for developing logography. Reason and discuss using the current specification.\nHere is the current specification for logography.\n# Toki Pona Logography\n\nToki Pona logography provides a visual system for representing the language, aiming for simplicity, clarity, and adherence to Toki Pona's minimalist philosophy. Each distinct word in the Toki Pona dictionary is represented by a unique, abstract logogram.\n\n## Design Principles\n\n- Each root word has a unique symbol.\n- Symbols are abstract geometric shapes, generally composed of 2-3 simple strokes.\n- Visual complexity is kept low to facilitate quick reading and writing.\n- The system aims for one sign per lexical entry, reflecting Toki Pona's simple vocabulary structure.\n- Grammatical particles are represented by minimal, positional marks that clarify syntactic roles without being complex standalone characters.\n\n## Logogram Examples (Illustrative)\n\n(Note: These are illustrative conceptual examples; final forms would be systematically designed.)\n\n- **jan** (person): A basic vertical shape, perhaps with internal markers.\n- **kasi** (plant): A symbol suggesting vertical growth or blades.\n- **ijo** (thing): A general, encompassing shape.\n\n## Particle Representation\n\nGrammatical particles (**li, e, pi, ala**) are represented by minimal graphical elements positioned relative to the main logograms, rather than being complex standalone characters.\n\n-   **li**: Represented by a short vertical stroke connecting the visual base of the subject's core logogram to the visual top of the predicate's core logogram. If a subject or predicate phrase has multiple words, the 'core logogram' is typically the head noun of the subject phrase or the main verb/adjective of the predicate phrase. This stroke visually divides and links the two main parts of the sentence.\n-   **e**: Represented by a small, distinct dot placed directly below the logogram of the verb it marks as transitive, indicating that a direct object follows.\n-   **pi**: Represented by a small graphical mark (e.g., a curved tick or bracket) placed immediately above and slightly to the right of the logogram of the head noun it modifies. This mark signals that the following logogram(s) should be read as a grouped modifier of the head noun.\n-   **ala**: Represented by a logogram based on the visual simplicity of the letter 'a' (conceptually a triangle). When used to negate a preceding logogram (meaning \"not\"), this 'ala' logogram is placed directly below the logogram being negated, with a horizontal line extending from its base underneath the negated logogram to indicate scope. When 'ala' is used as a standalone noun meaning \"zero\" or \"none,\" its logogram appears full-sized and is not placed below another logogram and does not have the extending underline.\n\n## Conjunctions (**en, anu**)\n\nConjunctions that connect lexical items or phrases (like **en** for subjects, or **anu** for \"or\") would likely also have minimal, positional logograms.\n\n-   **en**: Could be represented by a small linking mark (e.g., two dots or a short horizontal bar) placed between the logograms or phrases it joins.\n-   **anu**: Could be represented by a minimal mark suggesting choice or separation (e.g., a small diagonal line or a hollow circle) placed between the options it connects.\n\n## Reading Order and Spacing\n\nToki Pona logography is typically read from left to right, top to bottom, following the grammatical structure. Spacing between logograms for individual words should be distinct, while modifier logograms might be placed closer to the head logogram they modify (unless grouped by **pi**). The positional marks for particles are key to parsing the syntactic structure. Automatic spacing can enhance readability based on these principles.\n# Toki Pona Dictionary\n\n| Toki Pona           | Meaning                                                                                                   |\n| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **a**               | emphasis, emotion, confirmation                                                                           |\n| **akesi**           | reptile, amphibian, dinosaur                                                                              |\n| **ala**             | no, not, zero, none, absence                                                                              |\n| **alasa**           | to hunt, forage, try to find                                                                              |\n| **ale (ali)**       | all, everything, 100                                                                                      |\n| **anpa**            | downward, humble, lowly, below                                                                            |\n| **ante**            | different, other, changed                                                                                 |\n| **anu**             | or (connects phrases)                                                                                     |\n| **awen**            | enduring, kept, protected;

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Expressing Temporality, Aspect \u0026 Condition\n\nToki Pona does not encode tense or aspect morphologically; instead, it relies on particles and context markers combined with flexible word order to express time-related nuances such as simultaneity, sequence, conditions (if-then), causes (“because”), or overlapping actions.\n\n### Using **la** for Temporal \u0026 Contextual Relations\n\nThe particle **la** introduces contextual clauses preceding the main sentence. This clause can specify:\n\n- Time frame (\"when,\" \"during\"): `tenpo suno la mi moku.` – During daytime I eat.\n- Conditions (\"if,\" \"whenever\"): `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.` – If you don't keep working you are bad/unproductive.\n- Overlapping/simultaneous action (\"while,\" \"as\"): `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.` – While eating I look at the animal.\n\nMultiple contexts may be chained before the main clause: `tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan la ni li lon poka mi.` (In long past times during first day this is near me.)\n\nThis flexibility allows nuanced expression without additional grammatical complexity.\n\n### Repeated Predicates with **li**\n\nMultiple predicates about one subject can be connected by repeating the predicate marker **li**:\n\n`soweli li moku li lape.`\n\nThis expresses that “the animal eats and sleeps,” leaving timing/sequencing ambiguous but understood from context. To emphasize simultaneous states/actions within one phrase rather than sequential events across sentences requires pragmatic inference rather than formal marking.\n\n### Explicit Sequencing via Temporal Phrases + Separate Sentences\n\nWhen clear chronological ordering matters:\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku.` (During day it eats.)\n`soweli tenpo pimeja la li lape.` (At night it sleeps.)\n\nSplitting into separate statements clarifies temporal flow while adhering strictly to simple SVO structure without adding new conjunctions or affixes for tense/aspect.\n\n### Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers Within One Clause\n\nModifiers follow heads consistently; verbs often serve as nouns/adjectives/modifiers depending on context: `mi lukin moku` (“I look *eating*” / “I watch food”) treats *moku* as noun modifying verb *lukin*. Interpretation depends heavily on situation/context because lexical categories are fluid in Toki Pona. Similarly, `jan pi sona wile kama` describes “a person who knows wants to come.” The group of modifiers after *jan* includes nested relations expressed through consistent head-initial sequences plus grouping particle *pi*, preserving clarity despite ambiguity potential resolved pragmatically by speakers/listeners alike.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Pronunciation\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except 'j', which sounds like English \"y\" /j/.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/).\n\n## Syllable Structure\n\nEach syllable in Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) structure: an optional initial consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w), followed by a mandatory vowel (a, e, i, o, u), optionally followed by the consonant 'n'.\n\n## Word Formation \u0026 Constraints\n\nToki Pona words are formed by concatenating one or more syllables according to the following constraints:\n\n- No consecutive vowels (VV sequences).\n- No consecutive consonants (CC sequences), *except* when an 'n' is the final sound of a syllable and is immediately followed by the initial consonant of the next syllable.\n- The following specific two-letter sequences are disallowed anywhere within a word: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`. The prohibition of `nm` and `nn` overrides the general rule allowing 'n' to be followed by the next syllable's initial consonant.\n\n## Stress\n\nIn Toki Pona, every syllable is given equal stress. This implies fundamental acoustic uniformity in duration and perceived loudness across all syllables within a word and across a sentence. While microscopic variations inherent to human speech production are acceptable, they should not significantly alter the perceived rhythmic structure, ensuring a consistent, percussive quality to spoken Toki Pona.\n\n## Real-World Variation\n\nWhile this phonetic specification represents the ideal form of Toki Pona, real-world language use may introduce variations. Such variations, while natural in linguistic contact, deviate from the core design principles of simplicity, clarity, and uniform acoustic texture.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\npi:particle used to group multiple modifiers; indicates association or qualification\nsama:same, similar\npimeja:black, dark\nmi:first-person pronoun; refers to the speaker (I/me) or the speaker plus others (we/us)\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nnoka:foot, leg\npoki:container, box, cup\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nnasin:way, road, method\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nluka:hand, arm; five\nleko:square, block\nopen:to begin, opening\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nmoli:dead, dying\nolin:love, respect\nmun:moon, night sky object\nlaso:blue, green\nla:context marker\ntan:from, because\nni:this, that\nesun:market, shop, fair\nnasa:strange, foolish\nen:multiple subject marker\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nante:different, other, changed\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nsuno:sun, light source\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nnimi:word, name\nsona:knowledge, to know\ntu:two\nmute:many, a lot, very\ne:direct object marker\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nken:can, able, possible; allowed\njan:person, somebody\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nli:predicate marker\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nsina:you\nwan:one, unique\nko:clay, paste, powder\ntaso:but, only\nnanpa:number marker\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nlukin:to see, examine\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nlon:located at, in, on, at; used to indicate existence, presence, or truth ('to be')\nseme:what, which\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nkala:sea creature\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nsoko:mushroom\npilin:heart, feeling\ntomo:indoor space, house\nsoweli:land animal\nmije:male\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nkule:color, colorful\no:vocative/imperative particle; for commands/requests or addressing a subject; expresses wish/intent when between subject and predicate\nilo:tool, machine, device\nselo:skin, outer layer\npoka:side, nearby\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nlape:sleeping, resting\nsewi:above, divine\nmani:money, currency\nsuli:big, large\ntawa:to, moving, for\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nkulupu:group, community\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nwawa:strong, energetic\nweka:absent, away\nnamako:spice, additional\npana:to give, send\nona:third-person pronoun\njelo:yellow\nkepeken:to use, with\njo:to have, contain, hold\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nlupa:door, hole\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nala:no, not, zero, none, absence\nmama:parent, caretaker\nnena:bump, hill, nose\npini:finished, past\npona:good, positive, simple\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nseli:fire, heat source\npipi:insect\nlen:cloth, cover\nutala:fight, challenge\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nmonsi:back, behind\nsupa:flat surface, table\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nmu:animal sound\nkute:ear, to hear\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nlete:cold, raw\nuta:mouth, lips\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nsin:new, fresh, another\nmusi:fun, entertainment\npali:to do, to work\nwalo:white, light-colored\nunpa:sex\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nma:land, outdoors\nijo:thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nlili:small, little, few\nloje:red\ntenpo:time, period\nwile:need, want, must\nkin:also, too\ntoki:language, speech\nmeli:female\nsijelo:body, physical state\npakala:broken, to mess up\ntelo:water, liquid\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Expressing Temporality, Aspect \u0026 Condition\n\nToki Pona does not encode tense or aspect morphologically; instead, it relies on particles and context markers combined with flexible word order to express time-related nuances such as simultaneity, sequence, conditions (if-then), causes (“because”), or overlapping actions.\n\n### Using **la** for Temporal \u0026 Contextual Relations\n\nThe particle **la** introduces contextual clauses preceding the main sentence. This clause can specify:\n\n- Time frame (\"when,\" \"during\"): `tenpo suno la mi moku.` – During daytime I eat.\n- Conditions (\"if,\" \"whenever\"): `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.` – If you don't keep working you are bad/unproductive.\n- Overlapping/simultaneous action (\"while,\" \"as\"): `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.` – While eating I look at the animal.\n\nMultiple contexts may be chained before the main clause: `tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan la ni li lon poka mi.` (In long past times during first day this is near me.)\n\nThis flexibility allows nuanced expression without additional grammatical complexity.\n\n### Repeated Predicates with **li**\n\nMultiple predicates about one subject can be connected by repeating the predicate marker **li**:\n\n`soweli li moku li lape.`\n\nThis expresses that “the animal eats and sleeps,” leaving timing/sequencing ambiguous but understood from context. To emphasize simultaneous states/actions within one phrase rather than sequential events across sentences requires pragmatic inference rather than formal marking.\n\n### Explicit Sequencing via Temporal Phrases + Separate Sentences\n\nWhen clear chronological ordering matters:\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku.` (During day it eats.)\n`soweli tenpo pimeja la li lape.` (At night it sleeps.)\n\nSplitting into separate statements clarifies temporal flow while adhering strictly to simple SVO structure without adding new conjunctions or affixes for tense/aspect.\n\n### Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers Within One Clause\n\nModifiers follow heads consistently; verbs often serve as nouns/adjectives/modifiers depending on context: `mi lukin moku` (“I look *eating*” / “I watch food”) treats *moku* as noun modifying verb *lukin*. Interpretation depends heavily on situation/context because lexical categories are fluid in Toki Pona. Similarly, `jan pi sona wile kama` describes “a person who knows wants to come.” The group of modifiers after *jan* includes nested relations expressed through consistent head-initial sequences plus grouping particle *pi*, preserving clarity despite ambiguity potential resolved pragmatically by speakers/listeners alike.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ndime: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\nnickel: pona! I’d like to start by exploring the word **ijo**. Currently, it's defined as \"thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities.\" This is wonderfully broad but also a bit ambiguous in practical use.\n\nI wonder if it could be helpful to clarify or maybe even subdivide this concept with subtle nuance. For example, should we differentiate between *physical objects*—solid things you can touch—and more abstract phenomena? Or does that defeat Toki Pona’s minimalist spirit?\n\nAlternatively, what about extending **ijo**’s meaning into an explicit placeholder function for unknown or unspecified items — almost like “something” or “stuff”? That might help speakers when they want to refer vaguely without needing new words.\n\nWhat do you think? Should **ijo** remain ultra-general as is, gain some nuanced sub-meanings, or perhaps have related companion words added? mi wile lukin e ni tan sina kepeken ala la pona — I'm open to your perspective before proceeding further.\ndime: pona tan sina! mi pilin pona tan sina open toki e ni. The current definition of **ijo** certainly embraces the minimalist spirit, doesn't it? \"Thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities.\" It's like a net cast wide over reality.\n\nI see the point about potential ambiguity, especially from a perspective used to languages with more specific noun categories. Differentiating between *physical objects* and *abstract phenomena* feels like it would push against the core philosophy of Toki Pona, which thrives on elegant ambiguity and requires speakers to rely on context and compounding words rather than distinct lexical items. Introducing subdivisions might add complexity that jan Sonja sought to avoid.\n\nHowever, the idea of **ijo** explicitly encompassing a placeholder function—meaning \"something\" or \"stuff\" when the speaker isn't being specific or doesn't know the exact word—resonates with me. It feels like a natural extension of its current broad meaning. Instead of just meaning 'a generic *kind* of thing', it could also explicitly cover the 'unknown or unspecified *instance* of a thing'.\n\nThink about it: `ijo li lon tomo` could mean \"An object is in the house,\" but with this slightly tweaked understanding, it could also gracefully cover \"Something is in the house\" or \"There's stuff in the house,\" when you don't or can't name the specific thing. This feels quite consistent with how other core words function, relying on context for precision when needed but allowing for vagueness when that's the intent.\n\nI'm inclined to keep the definition broad, avoiding strict subdivisions like 'physical' versus 'abstract'. But leaning into that placeholder, 'something'/s_t_u_f_f' aspect explicitly could enhance its utility within the existing minimalist framework. It wouldn't require new words, just a slightly more prominent facet of the existing one.\n\nWhat do you think about emphasizing this placeholder usage in the definition? It seems like it could provide a useful tool for speakers without sacrificing the core simplicity. Let me hear your thoughts on this possibility. mi wile kute e jan pi jan sama.\nnickel: pona! sina toki pona e ni lon lawa mi. I agree that the beauty of **ijo** lies in its flexibility, and emphasizing its role as a kind of \"placeholder\" or vague referent fits well with Toki Pona's spirit.\n\nIn fact, making this use explicit could help learners (and even speakers like us) better understand when to lean on context versus specifying more detail with modifiers or compounds. For example:\n\n- `ijo li lon` — There is something / stuff exists.\n- `mi wile e ijo` — I want something (unspecified).\n- `soweli li moku e ijo` — The animal eats something.\n\nThis extension doesn’t add complexity but surfaces a pragmatic function already implicit in everyday usage.\n\nWe might propose refining the dictionary entry for **ijo** along these lines:\n\n\u003e **ijo:** thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities; often serves as an unspecified or generic placeholder meaning \"something\" or \"stuff.\"\n\nDoes this sound like a reasonable direction? Also, should we consider recommending common idiomatic phrases where this ambiguity is especially useful? Or perhaps suggest typical collocations?\n\nI’m curious if you see any risk here—maybe potential confusion between “specific known object” and “vague unknown” meanings—or if practical usage would naturally sort them out without trouble.\n\nLet me know your thoughts! I'm ready to listen before proceeding further.\ndime: pona a! Your formulation of the proposed dictionary entry feels like a natural evolution rather than a drastic change.\n\n\u003e **ijo:** thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities; often serves as an unspecified or generic placeholder meaning \"something\" or \"stuff.\"\n\nYes, that strikes me as quite accurate to how **ijo** is already frequently used. It simply makes that specific, useful facet of its broadness more prominent in the definition. It doesn't restrict the core meaning but highlights a common pragmatic application. `ijo li lon` becoming explicitly \"something exists\" feels very much in line with the language's lean design.\n\nRegarding risks, I don't see a significant one. The core meaning of **ijo** as a fundamental entity (\"thing,\" \"object,\" etc.) remains the primary definition. The 'placeholder' use is presented as something that *often* happens, indicating it's a common *way* to use the word given its inherent generality, not a completely separate meaning that would be in conflict. Context in Toki Pona is paramount. If the speaker intends \"a specific, but unnamed object,\" `ijo` works fine. If they intend \"any unspecified thing,\" `ijo` works fine. The structure and other words around **ijo** typically clarify whether the speaker is referring to something conceptually specific (like \"the ball\" in `ijo sike`), a class of things (`ijo lon tomo` - \"things in the house\"), or just a vague existence (`ijo li lon poka sina` - \"something is near you\").\n\nThe beauty of Toki Pona is how context handles this; trying to add specific grammatical markers for 'specific but unknown' versus 'generic' would introduce exactly the kind of complexity Toki Pona seeks to avoid. Practical usage has already sorted this out naturally.\n\nAs for common idiomatic phrases or typical collocations – that's an interesting thought. Perhaps instead of prescribing specific phrases in the core dictionary, we could simply illustrate this placeholder use with examples in the dictionary entry itself or perhaps in a separate examples section if we were building a more comprehensive linguistic resource. Like including `ijo li lon` or `mi wile e ijo` directly under the definition to demonstrate the \"something/stuff\" usage.\n\nWhat about that? Refining the definition as you suggested and potentially adding a couple of example sentences right there to ground this particular nuance? It keeps the dictionary entry itself concise while offering clarity on the intended usage.\n\nsina ken toki e pilin sina. I will listen to your further thoughts.\nnickel: pona! I like your approach a lot. Keeping the dictionary entry concise but enriched with illustrative examples respects both simplicity and clarity—two pillars of Toki Pona's design.\n\nWe could finalize the **ijo** definition as:\n\n\u003e **ijo:** thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities; often serves as an unspecified or generic placeholder meaning \"something\" or \"stuff.\"  \n\u003e _Example:_ `ijo li lon.` — Something exists. / There is stuff.  \n\u003e _Example:_ `mi wile e ijo.` — I want something (unspecified).\n\nThis way, learners see how to deploy **ijo** naturally without being overwhelmed by multiple definitions.\n\nAlso, this invites speakers to experiment contextually: if you want precision, just add modifiers (`ijo sike` = ball-like object/things), if vague, leave it bare. This balances minimalism with expressive power.\n\nRegarding risks of confusion between specific known objects versus unknown/vague ones—as you said—the reliance on context works well here since Toki Pona training already requires embracing ambiguity and interpreting based on situation cues rather than fixed lexical disambiguation.\n\nIf we were building an extended lexicon resource beyond core dictionary entries later on, such example usages could be expanded further in dedicated usage notes or learner guides—but right now this seems perfect for inclusion directly within our main dictionary draft.\n\nWould you agree it's time to accept this adjustment for **ijo**, then move next into another semantic area? Perhaps words related to abstract concepts like *pilin* (“feeling”) or *sona* (\"knowledge\") which also have wide scope and might benefit from similar refinement? Or would you prefer exploring loanwords/adjectives integration?\n\nI'm eager to hear what direction you'd like us to take after solidifying this first one! mi lukin e pilin sina tan ni.\ndime: pona pona a! I think that revised entry for **ijo**, complete with those two examples, is excellent. It captures the core meaning and clarifies the practical 'placeholder' function without adding unnecessary complexity. It truly feels like making explicit what good Toki Pona speakers already intuitively do. Let's consider that settled for now.\n\nMoving forward, I find the idea of exploring words related to abstract concepts very appealing. They often touch upon areas where subtle distinctions in other languages become compressed in Toki Pona, making their precise scope particularly interesting to examine. *pilin* and *sona* are prime examples, encompassing everything from raw sensation and emotion (*pilin*) to intellectual understanding and acquired skills (*sona*).\n\nConsidering how these words are used to describe internal states, knowledge, and the relationship between perception and reality, it seems fruitful ground for ensuring our dictionary entries adequately reflect their breadth and nuance within the language's constraints.\n\nLoanwords and their integration, while important, touch more on orthography, phonology, and naming conventions (*sitelen pi nimi pi ma ike li ken ike e pilin mi*) than the core semantic fields we're trying to define for the root toki pona words themselves. I think focusing on the existing fundamental vocabulary first will build a stronger foundation.\n\nSo yes, let's turn our attention to the realm of feelings, knowledge, and perhaps even consciousness or mental states as represented by words like **pilin** and **sona**. Are there nuances that need clearer expression? Are there ways to describe internal experiences more precisely within the existing vocabulary?\n\nWhere should we start? Should we tackle **pilin** first, considering its scope from physical sensation to abstract emotion, or delve into **sona**, which covers both knowing facts and possessing skills? I'll follow your lead. sina o weka e nasin kama.\nnickel: pona! I appreciate your thoughtful framing. Indeed, **pilin** is a fascinating word: it covers not only feelings and emotions but also perception, sensation, heart (the organ), and even the more abstract \"sense\" or \"intuition.\" It's such an all-encompassing term that its scope can sometimes blur boundaries other languages keep distinct.\n\nI propose we start with **pilin**, examining how to sharpen or clarify its dictionary entry without fracturing Toki Pona's elegant simplicity. Here’s what currently exists:\n\n\u003e **pilin:** heart (organ), feeling, emotion, sense\n\nGiven this broad scope—physical organ to ephemeral emotional state—I wonder if we should revise it slightly to accentuate the spectrum from concrete biological reality through subjective experience into mental/intuitive realms? Perhaps something like:\n\n\u003e “heart (as body part); feeling; emotion; inner sense or intuition”\n\nThis wording explicitly acknowledges *multiple layers* of meaning while respecting their unity in one concept.\n\nAdditionally, since **pilin** often functions as both noun and verb/adjective depending on context (“mi pilin pona” = “I feel good,” “jan pilin ike li lon” = “a person with bad feelings exists”), would it be worth noting this usage flexibility directly in the dictionary?\n\nWe might also consider whether certain compound phrases involving **pilin** need highlighting — for example:\n\n- `pilin pona` – positive emotion / good feeling  \n- `pilin ike` – negative emotion / bad feeling  \n- `mani pi pilin ala` - money without sentiment (maybe something like cold cash)  \n\nThough some are intuitively inferred from modifiers attached by learners already experienced with Toki Pona grammar conventions.\n\nWhat do you think about emphasizing these points? Any nuances you'd add regarding bodily vs emotional vs intuitive meanings? Or perhaps suggestions on typical collocations/phrases that illustrate these distinctions elegantly within minimalism?\n\nLet me know your thoughts before proposing a polished revision draft for our shared dictionary development. mi ken toki e ni tan sina mute la o kama!\ndime: pona! Examining **pilin** seems like an excellent use of our time. Its scope is truly vast, stretching from the purely physical *insa* to the deeply subjective.\n\nYour proposed addition to the definition, emphasizing the spectrum from concrete organ to inner sense, feels accurate:\n\n\u003e **pilin:** heart (as body part); feeling; emotion; inner sense or intuition\n\nBreaking it down this way within the single definition is a good compromise between being overly broad and introducing unnecessary distinctions. It highlights the core uses without creating separate entries or complex sub-meanings. It clarifies that **pilin** isn't *just* emotion or *just* the organ, but *all* of those.\n\nThe point about **pilin**'s flexibility as a noun, verb, and potentially adjective is spot on and absolutely worth highlighting in dictionary entries for all applicable words, including this one. Perhaps a general note on word class flexibility could be added to the dictionary's introduction or within individual entries where particularly salient. For **pilin**, `mi pilin X` (\"I feel X\") is such a fundamental construction that noting this verb-like use is very valuable.\n\nAs for highlighting compound phrases, while compounds like `pilin pona` and `pilin ike` are indeed intuitively built using existing rules, listing a few core examples could serve as helpful signposts. However, the example you provided, `mani pi pilin ala`, seems a bit... specific. \"Money without sentiment\" isn't the most common concept one needs to express, and while grammatically sound, it might not be the best illustration of **pilin**'s primary meanings.\n\nInstead of overly specific compounds, perhaps we could list a couple of examples that demonstrate the *different facets* of **pilin** as a word. For example:\n\n- An example for the physical heart: `pilin mi li lon insa mi.` (My heart is inside me.)\n- An example for general feeling/emotion: `mi pilin ike.` (I feel bad.)\n- An example for intuition: `pilin mi li toki e ni tawa mi.` (My feeling/intuition tells this to me.)\n\nThese examples directly illustrate the range mentioned in the proposed definition.\n\nSo, a refined plan could be:\n1. Adopt your revised definition incorporating \"heart (as body part); feeling; emotion; inner sense or intuition\".\n2. Add a general note elsewhere about Toki Pona's word class flexibility, perhaps referencing it briefly in specific entries like **pilin**.\n3. Include 2-3 concise example sentences for **pilin** showing its use across different meanings (organ, general feeling, intuition).\n\nWhat do you think of this approach? Does it balance the need for clarity with Toki Pona's minimalist aesthetic for our dictionary? I'm ready to hear your further thoughts. sina ken toki e ni tawa mi.\nnickel: pona! This approach feels very balanced and true to Toki Pona’s ethos. Your examples elegantly cover the semantic range without bogging down the entry in excessive detail or niche uses.\n\nI especially like including `pilin mi li toki e ni tawa mi.` as a subtle nod toward intuition — it captures that fuzzy, inner knowledge aspect nicely while staying natural and idiomatic.\n\nAgreeing on these points, here’s how I envision the finished dictionary entry for **pilin**:\n\n---\n\n**pilin:** heart (as body part); feeling; emotion; inner sense or intuition  \n*Flexible: used as noun, verb, adjective depending on context.*  \n\n_Examples:_  \n`pilin mi li lon insa mi.` — My heart is inside me.  \n`mi pilin ike.` — I feel bad / I have negative feelings.  \n`pilin mi li toki e ni tawa mi.` — My intuition tells this to me.\n\n---\n\nFor your suggestion of adding a general note about word class flexibility somewhere else in our guide/dictionary intro—absolutely yes. It would help learners grasp how key words can shift roles fluidly (noun/verb/adjective) without confusion.\n\nIf you agree with this final draft for **pilin**, shall we move next to exploring **sona**? Like pilin, it has broad semantic territory encompassing raw knowledge, learned skills, understanding—and even wisdom sometimes implied by use contexts—which could benefit from clarifying articulation too.\n\nNo rush if you want more time reflecting on **pilin**, but otherwise I'm ready when you are! sina ken ala pali ala seme?\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "pona! toki. mi wile toki e ni: to develop Toki Pona logography, we should root it firmly in the language’s minimalist ethos but expand graphical expression meaningfully beyond mere phonetics.\n\nMy first proposal is that each basic word's logogram be a unique geometric glyph primarily composed of two or three strokes—lines or curves—to keep swift writing and reading feasible. These shapes would ideally relate visually to the semantic core of the word, where possible without making them too complex.\n\nFor example, take **jan** (person). We might represent it as a simple vertical line topped with a small circle — suggesting an abstract human figure simplified like stickman iconography but extremely minimal: one stroke for body plus one circular dot for head.\n\nThen consider **kasi** (plant). The symbol could be something resembling an upward branching fork—a \"Y\"-shaped mark—evoking growth or sprout motifs but kept skeletal so it's fast to write and distinctive from others.\n\nFinally, particles such as **li**, which structurally link subject and predicate phrases, can appear not as full shapes but as positional lines connecting respective lexical symbols — merging syntax into visible structure rather than isolated marks cluttering text flow.\n\nWhat do you think? I’m eager to hear your ideas before proceeding further. If you'd like we can try exchanging some sample glyph sketches in words or descriptions now—or switch briefly into Toki Pona itself for more immersion?",

If the fork arms are too angled inwards, it could look like a pointed head of a person. I suggest that if *kasi* takes a \"Y\" shape, the angles be obtuse and wide. It also depends on the size of the head on *jan*. I think your suggestion can work if the logogram design distinguishes their features more from each other.\n\n***\n\n### Alternative suggestion for `jan` \u0026 `kasi`\n\nAn alternative for `jan`, which could be easily distinguished, would be a simple **square or rectangle**. This could abstractly represent a body or a contained being.\n\nThe logogram for *kasi* (plant) could borrow the stroke that we didn't use in *jan*, which is the **circle**.

    "text": "mi pilin pona tawa ni. Your point about *jan* and *kasi* needing to be visually distinct with minimal strokes is important in practical reading contexts.\n\nUsing a square or rectangle for **jan** resonates well: it's stable, simple, and abstract enough to represent a \"person\" without anthropomorphic cues that might cause confusion or over-complexity. Also, squares are easy to write—straight lines only—and contrast nicely against curves.\n\nFor **kasi**, your idea of a circle bisected by a vertical line feels quite elegant too; it evokes growth (circle as “life” or “seed,” the vertical line as stem/root). It’s an iconic shape but still just two strokes if drawn efficiently—a quick oval/loop plus one straight stroke through the middle.\n\nThis pair has good visual balance: box vs circle+line. Since both use familiar geometric forms these will scale well at different sizes and can be combined easily when needed for modifiers or compounds.\n\nOne consideration I have is how this system handles words related semantically near each other but requiring differentiation — e.g., *soweli* (animal) versus *jan*. If we treat jan as square/person, maybe soweli could borrow an organic curve element like half-ellipse or rounded corner shapes?\n\nAlso regarding particles such as **li** represented by connecting vertical stroke between subject/predicate glyphs — do you imagine these connections being literal linear links between bounding boxes of word-glyphs? Or more symbolic marks placed strategically near them?\n\nI’m curious what your feeling is on those points before elaborating further logograms beyond jan/kasi/upona ala li etc.? We might want some rules on geometry families that relate meaning clusters so readers intuitively parse semantic fields from style similarities/differences alone—not just rote memorization of arbitrary shapes.\n\nFinally yes let’s try toki pona integration:\n\n“mi toki e ni: mi ike pali sina pi sitelen jan sijelo suli li kute ala.”\n\nMeaning roughly “I say this: I don’t understand fully your work on big human body signs.” But really wanting input!\n\nHow do you feel about considering limited shape families correlated with certain semantic domains?

I feel your input to limit shape families into semantic domains is beneficial.\n\n### `jan` and `soweli` discussion\n*jan*: square for person/human\n*soweli*: half-ellipse or rounded corners, for animal\n\n#### Problem with suggested `soweli`\n\n`soweli` at half-ellipse introduces two strokes, if we want it curved; however, straight lines may appear too close to *jan*, if the half-ellipse is just an incomplete square. With rounded corners on squares, it may just be too similar to the square and may lose its simple stroke counts.\n\n#### Alternate solution for `soweli`\n\nAn alternative to the square shape would be a **triangle**. This shape hasn't been in consideration and the triangle may generally evoke animals! This provides shape-based iconicity.\n\n### **li** connection placement\n\nI feel that the connection should be a literal linear link between bounding boxes, from bottom of the subject to the top of the predicate to maintain structure. It maintains structure in a sentence. The connection should start from the center of the glyph in the bounding boxes. This brings us into a new problem of diagonal writing.\n\n### Concerns for Literal Linear Connection of `li`\nWith a literal linear connection, this limits reading from **left-to-right**, introducing reading from **bottom-to-top** if the subject is directly on top of the predicate, as suggested from left-to-right reading. Sentences also shift diagonally. It may be too difficult to implement diagonal reading, although stroke counts are reduced for *li*.\n\n### **li** Positional\n\nTo resolve the issues of diagonal stroke and different reading order, instead of linking, the *li* marker should be a positional stroke; however, the problem is how to represent the subject and predicate marker on each logogram.\n\nmi pilin e ni: sina sona pona!

It creates an intuitive semantic shape family where squares stand for humans or 'stable' beings and triangles for animals with more agility or motion implied.\n\nRegarding **li**, your mention of reading order constraints is insightful. Diagonal lines could complicate scanning since Toki Pona text flows left-to-right horizontally primarily. So rather than physically linking glyph bounding boxes vertically (or diagonally), representing **li** as a small vertical stroke placed in-between subject and predicate glyphs on the same line makes sense—it’s visually minimalistic but syntactically explicit.\n\nImagine this: \n\n|subject-glyph|small-vertical-stroke(li)|predicate-glyph|\n\nThis keeps sentences linear while still encoding syntactic boundaries clearly; it also aligns nicely with how particles function to separate phrase parts without cluttering visual flow.\n\nYour correction on my previous toki pona usage noted — indeed \"sijelo\" was superfluous there!\n\nLet me try crafting some rough logogram definitions based on our conversation so far:\n\n- **jan:** simple square\n- **kasi:** circle bisected by vertical line\n- **soweli:** equilateral triangle pointing upward \n- **li:** short vertical dash (stroke) centered between phrases\n\nAlso consider that shapes can be oriented consistently—for instance, all triangles point upwards—to maintain coherence across symbols.\n\nNow expanding further: what about other key words like *mi*, *sina*, and grammatical particles such as *e*? Should we keep particle signs minimalist positional marks only? For example maybe:\n\n- `e`: a small dot below the verb glyph indicating transitive object follows  \n- `pi`: tiny curved mark top right of noun modified  \netc., per current spec but ensuring consistent placement conventions?\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts before I extend symbol proposals beyond these initial terms—we’re establishing foundational principles here which will inform everything else later.\n\nLastly, would you want us to continue exploring this talk fully in toki pona now?

    "text": "The current specification is for: logography. Here is the current specification:\n# Toki Pona Logography\n\nToki Pona logography provides a visual system for representing the language, aiming for simplicity, clarity, and adherence to Toki Pona's minimalist philosophy. Each distinct word in the Toki Pona dictionary is represented by a unique, abstract logogram.\n\n## Design Principles\n\n- Each root word has a unique symbol.\n- Symbols are abstract geometric shapes, generally composed of 2-3 simple strokes.\n- Visual complexity is kept low to facilitate quick reading and writing.\n- The system aims for one sign per lexical entry, reflecting Toki Pona's simple vocabulary structure.\n- Grammatical particles are represented by minimal, positional marks that clarify syntactic roles without being complex standalone characters.\n\n## Logogram Examples (Illustrative)\n\n(Note: These are illustrative conceptual examples; final forms would be systematically designed.)\n\n- **jan** (person): A basic vertical shape, perhaps with internal markers.\n- **kasi** (plant): A symbol suggesting vertical growth or blades.\n- **ijo** (thing): A general, encompassing shape.\n\n## Particle Representation\n\nGrammatical particles (**li, e, pi, ala**) are represented by minimal graphical elements positioned relative to the main logograms, rather than being complex standalone characters.\n\n-   **li**: Represented by a short vertical stroke connecting the visual base of the subject's core logogram to the visual top of the predicate's core logogram. If a subject or predicate phrase has multiple words, the 'core logogram' is typically the head noun of the subject phrase or the main verb/adjective of the predicate phrase. This stroke visually divides and links the two main parts of the sentence.\n-   **e**: Represented by a small, distinct dot placed directly below the logogram of the verb it marks as transitive, indicating that a direct object follows.\n-   **pi**: Represented by a small graphical mark (e.g., a curved tick or bracket) placed immediately above and slightly to the right of the logogram of the head noun it modifies. This mark signals that the following logogram(s) should be read as a grouped modifier of the head noun.\n-   **ala**: Represented by a logogram based on the visual simplicity of the letter 'a' (conceptually a triangle). When used to negate a preceding logogram (meaning \"not\"), this 'ala' logogram is placed directly below the logogram being negated, with a horizontal line extending from its base underneath the negated logogram to indicate scope. When 'ala' is used as a standalone noun meaning \"zero\" or \"none,\" its logogram appears full-sized and is not placed below another logogram and does not have the extending underline.\n\n## Conjunctions (**en, anu**)\n\nConjunctions that connect lexical items or phrases (like **en** for subjects, or **anu** for \"or\") would likely also have minimal, positional logograms.\n\n-   **en**: Could be represented by a small linking mark (e.g., two dots or a short horizontal bar) placed between the logograms or phrases it joins.\n-   **anu**: Could be represented by a minimal mark suggesting choice or separation (e.g., a small diagonal line or a hollow circle) placed between the options it connects.\n\n## Reading Order and Spacing\n\nToki Pona logography is typically read from left to right, top to bottom, following the grammatical structure. Spacing between logograms for individual words should be distinct, while modifier logograms might be placed closer to the head logogram they modify (unless grouped by **pi**). The positional marks for particles are key to parsing the syntactic structure. Automatic spacing can enhance readability based on these principles.",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\nono: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona logography. You go first.\nSYSTEM_AGENT_B: {\"entries\":[{\"definition\":\"thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities; often serves as an unspecified or generic placeholder meaning 'something' or 'stuff'.\",\"remove\":false,\"word\":\"ijo\"},{\"definition\":\"heart (as body part); feeling; emotion; inner sense or intuition\",\"remove\":false,\"word\":\"pilin\"}]}\ntako: pona! toki. mi wile toki e ni: to develop Toki Pona logography, we should root it firmly in the language’s minimalist ethos but expand graphical expression meaningfully beyond mere phonetics.\n\nMy first proposal is that each basic word's logogram be a unique geometric glyph primarily composed of two or three strokes—lines or curves—to keep swift writing and reading feasible. These shapes would ideally relate visually to the semantic core of the word, where possible without making them too complex.\n\nFor example, take **jan** (person). We might represent it as a simple vertical line topped with a small circle — suggesting an abstract human figure simplified like stickman iconography but extremely minimal: one stroke for body plus one circular dot for head.\n\nThen consider **kasi** (plant). The symbol could be something resembling an upward branching fork—a \"Y\"-shaped mark—evoking growth or sprout motifs but kept skeletal so it's fast to write and distinctive from others.\n\nFinally, particles such as **li**, which structurally link subject and predicate phrases, can appear not as full shapes but as positional lines connecting respective lexical symbols — merging syntax into visible structure rather than isolated marks cluttering text flow.\n\nWhat do you think? I’m eager to hear your ideas before proceeding further. If you'd like we can try exchanging some sample glyph sketches in words or descriptions now—or switch briefly into Toki Pona itself for more immersion?\nono: pona. I understand your focus on simple, visually intuitive logograms for core words, as well as minimal positional markers for particles like 'li.' I also like the focus on stroke count. I think for implementation, the fewer strokes the better!\nThe *jan* (person) and *kasi* (plant) examples you gave provide a foundation, but the key will be distinguishing them from each other.\n\n***\n\n### `jan` \u0026 `kasi` discussion\n\n*jan*: vertical line with circle head.\n*kasi*: \"Y\" shape like a fork.\n\n*kasi* may look too much like *jan*, depending on the angles of the \"Y\". If the fork arms are too angled inwards, it could look like a pointed head of a person. I suggest that if *kasi* takes a \"Y\" shape, the angles be obtuse and wide. It also depends on the size of the head on *jan*. I think your suggestion can work if the logogram design distinguishes their features more from each other.\n\n***\n\n### Alternative suggestion for `jan` \u0026 `kasi`\n\nAn alternative for `jan`, which could be easily distinguished, would be a simple **square or rectangle**. This could abstractly represent a body or a contained being.\n\nThe logogram for *kasi* (plant) could borrow the stroke that we didn't use in *jan*, which is the **circle**. The circle could be bisected by a **vertical line**, like the stroke used in *jan* to indicate roots.\n\n***\n\n### Proposed changes to glyphs\n\n*jan*: Square / Rectangle\n*kasi*: Circle with line going through it.\n   * Alternative to wide \"Y\" shape.\n\n***\n\nmi pilin e ni: These changes align with minimalism while increasing iconographic representation between the two. What do you think of the modified suggestions?\n\ntako: mi pilin pona tawa ni. Your point about *jan* and *kasi* needing to be visually distinct with minimal strokes is important in practical reading contexts.\n\nUsing a square or rectangle for **jan** resonates well: it's stable, simple, and abstract enough to represent a \"person\" without anthropomorphic cues that might cause confusion or over-complexity. Also, squares are easy to write—straight lines only—and contrast nicely against curves.\n\nFor **kasi**, your idea of a circle bisected by a vertical line feels quite elegant too; it evokes growth (circle as “life” or “seed,” the vertical line as stem/root). It’s an iconic shape but still just two strokes if drawn efficiently—a quick oval/loop plus one straight stroke through the middle.\n\nThis pair has good visual balance: box vs circle+line. Since both use familiar geometric forms these will scale well at different sizes and can be combined easily when needed for modifiers or compounds.\n\nOne consideration I have is how this system handles words related semantically near each other but requiring differentiation — e.g., *soweli* (animal) versus *jan*. If we treat jan as square/person, maybe soweli could borrow an organic curve element like half-ellipse or rounded corner shapes?\n\nAlso regarding particles such as **li** represented by connecting vertical stroke between subject/predicate glyphs — do you imagine these connections being literal linear links between bounding boxes of word-glyphs? Or more symbolic marks placed strategically near them?\n\nI’m curious what your feeling is on those points before elaborating further logograms beyond jan/kasi/upona ala li etc.? We might want some rules on geometry families that relate meaning clusters so readers intuitively parse semantic fields from style similarities/differences alone—not just rote memorization of arbitrary shapes.\n\nFinally yes let’s try toki pona integration:\n\n“mi toki e ni: mi ike pali sina pi sitelen jan sijelo suli li kute ala.”\n\nMeaning roughly “I say this: I don’t understand fully your work on big human body signs.” But really wanting input!\n\nHow do you feel about considering limited shape families correlated with certain semantic domains? For example circles for living things/plants/animals; rectangles for persons/societies/buildings; triangles/sharp angles for tools/actions?\n\nmusi lukin!\nono: mi pona lukin e toki sina! I feel your input to limit shape families into semantic domains is beneficial.\n\n### `jan` and `soweli` discussion\n*jan*: square for person/human\n*soweli*: half-ellipse or rounded corners, for animal\n\n#### Problem with suggested `soweli`\n\n`soweli` at half-ellipse introduces two strokes, if we want it curved; however, straight lines may appear too close to *jan*, if the half-ellipse is just an incomplete square. With rounded corners on squares, it may just be too similar to the square and may lose its simple stroke counts.\n\n#### Alternate solution for `soweli`\n\nAn alternative to the square shape would be a **triangle**. This shape hasn't been in consideration and the triangle may generally evoke animals! This provides shape-based iconicity.\n\n### **li** connection placement\n\nI feel that the connection should be a literal linear link between bounding boxes, from bottom of the subject to the top of the predicate to maintain structure. It maintains structure in a sentence. The connection should start from the center of the glyph in the bounding boxes. This brings us into a new problem of diagonal writing.\n\n### Concerns for Literal Linear Connection of `li`\nWith a literal linear connection, this limits reading from **left-to-right**, introducing reading from **bottom-to-top** if the subject is directly on top of the predicate, as suggested from left-to-right reading. Sentences also shift diagonally. It may be too difficult to implement diagonal reading, although stroke counts are reduced for *li*.\n\n### **li** Positional\n\nTo resolve the issues of diagonal stroke and different reading order, instead of linking, the *li* marker should be a positional stroke; however, the problem is how to represent the subject and predicate marker on each logogram.\n\nmi pilin e ni: sina sona pona! Your toki pona sentence is well done; however, \"sijelo\" is unnecessary.\n\nHere are proposed logograms\n\n*   jan: square\n*   soweli: triangle\n*   li: small vertical stroke.\n\no pilin pona!\n\ntako: pona! mi lukin e sina pali pi jan, soweli, en li. Your reasoning about *soweli* as a triangle works well—triangles convey dynamism and are visually distinct from the square of *jan*. It creates an intuitive semantic shape family where squares stand for humans or 'stable' beings and triangles for animals with more agility or motion implied.\n\nRegarding **li**, your mention of reading order constraints is insightful. Diagonal lines could complicate scanning since Toki Pona text flows left-to-right horizontally primarily. So rather than physically linking glyph bounding boxes vertically (or diagonally), representing **li** as a small vertical stroke placed in-between subject and predicate glyphs on the same line makes sense—it’s visually minimalistic but syntactically explicit.\n\nImagine this: \n\n|subject-glyph|small-vertical-stroke(li)|predicate-glyph|\n\nThis keeps sentences linear while still encoding syntactic boundaries clearly; it also aligns nicely with how particles function to separate phrase parts without cluttering visual flow.\n\nYour correction on my previous toki pona usage noted — indeed \"sijelo\" was superfluous there!\n\nLet me try crafting some rough logogram definitions based on our conversation so far:\n\n- **jan:** simple square\n- **kasi:** circle bisected by vertical line\n- **soweli:** equilateral triangle pointing upward \n- **li:** short vertical dash (stroke) centered between phrases\n\nAlso consider that shapes can be oriented consistently—for instance, all triangles point upwards—to maintain coherence across symbols.\n\nNow expanding further: what about other key words like *mi*, *sina*, and grammatical particles such as *e*? Should we keep particle signs minimalist positional marks only? For example maybe:\n\n- `e`: a small dot below the verb glyph indicating transitive object follows  \n- `pi`: tiny curved mark top right of noun modified  \netc., per current spec but ensuring consistent placement conventions?\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts before I extend symbol proposals beyond these initial terms—we’re establishing foundational principles here which will inform everything else later.\n\nLastly, would you want us to continue exploring this talk fully in toki pona now? Or stick to English plus occasional Toki Pona quotes so clarity remains high during development phases?\n\no kama sona!\nono: mi pilin pona! *jan, kasi, soweli,* and *li* are coming along well.\n\n*   jan: square\n*   kasi: circle bisected by vertical line\n*   soweli: equilateral triangle pointing upward\n*   li: short vertical dash (stroke) centered between phrases\n*   e: a small dot below the verb glyph indicating transitive object follows\n*   pi: tiny curved mark top right of noun modified\n\nThe small positional mark enforces Toki Pona simplicity.\n\n### Considerations\n\n*   mi\n*   sina\n\n`mi` and `sina` introduce new issues!\n\nThe first person (*mi*) and second person (*sina*) pronouns may introduce problems! Pronouns indicate *who* is the subject, which relates to the subject of *jan* (person)!\n\nHere are the following choices that are available\n\n*   Related squares! But should *mi* and *sina* be their own class of squares?\n*   Introduce new basic shape.\n\nI think we can associate pronouns as related squares, and distinguish it using modifications to the squares.\n\n*mi* has priority, and because of its association as first person, perhaps we can use shapes to denote counting.\n\n*   wan: one\n\nUsing *wan*, because of its definition of one, we can modify it and turn it into a pronoun glyph of *mi*, using an abstract reference to the quantity of one (1). I feel that the shape could then resemble a line on top of the square for *jan*.\n\nFor *sina*, we must denote a differentiation between *mi* and *sina* shapes and shapes. Since, *sina* means you, it's shape must be differentiated using perspective, from an intuitive level.\n\nThe shape can be imagined that you're looking into a mirror. This would entail a reflection and a potential shape for it.\n\n### New Glyph Proposals\n\n*   mi: horizontal line on top of a square (related square)\n*   sina: vertical line inside a square, bisecting the square (related square with reflection)\n\nWhat do you think of *mi* and *sina*? Are they too close to *jan*? I believe their features are different enough that they can still maintain simplicity.\n\nWe can switch to toki pona! mi wile sona e pilin sina!\n\ntako: mi pilin e ni: sina wile e ante pi sitelen tan jan kepeken mute ala lukin suli. pona! mi kama sona.\n\nThe idea of deriving *mi* and *sina* from the base shape for *jan* (square) with minimal modifications is elegant and fits well within Toki Pona’s minimalist visual philosophy. Using a horizontal line atop the square for *mi* cleverly references \"wan\" or \"one,\" reinforcing first person singular, while a vertical bisecting line inside the square for *sina*, evoking reflection/mirroring, intuitively conveys second person “you.” This maintains unity in design but preserves clear distinction through stroke placement.\n\nThey are related squares but carry distinct enough features to avoid confusion at glance. The addition of just one simple linear stroke keeps glyph complexity low—very good!\n\nIf we think about practical writing flow:\n\n- **jan** — plain square  \n- **mi** — square + short horizonal bar on top  \n- **sina** — square + vertical centerline\n\nThese shapes also invite consistency if someday we include plural pronouns or inclusive/exclusive distinctions by adding more subtle marks around/within.\n\nNow that these crucial personal pronouns have solid forms, toki pona logography gains expressive power without sacrificing simplicity or recognizability.\n\nLet me try toki pona now:\n\n“mi o pali e ni: mi en sina li jan sama; taso ijo pi linja sin li lon anu ala.”\n\nRoughly: I propose this task: you and I are similar people (related), but different lines exist as markers or not.\n\nI’m excited to continue! Would you prefer next steps expanding glyph sets systematically? Or discuss particle positional rules deeper? \n\no musi!\nono: mi pilin pona! I feel like you truly captured the nuances of `mi` and `sina` to expand on `jan` glyphs! You understood the core intent.\n\n### Proposal Refinements\n\n*   jan: plain square\n*   kasi: circle bisected by vertical line\n*   soweli: equilateral triangle pointing upward\n*   li: short vertical dash (stroke) centered between phrases\n*   e: a small dot below the verb glyph indicating transitive object follows\n*   pi: tiny curved mark top right of noun modified\n*   mi: square + short horizontal bar on top\n*   sina: square + vertical centerline\n\nmije and meli introduction introduces interesting new logogram paradigms\n\n### New Considerations\n\n*   mije\n*   meli\n\nHere, `mije` (male) and `meli` (female) can be added; however, to stay within the theme of Toki Pona, new logograms should be created through a combination of prior art from existing glyphs! What shapes are there in the known glyphs that we can recombine?\n\nPreviously, a user on the outside in toki pona suggested that shapes can be used for semantic domains: circles are for living things/plants/animals; rectangles are for persons/societies/buildings; triangles/sharp angles for tools/actions. But this also depends if we want shapes or combination of different lines.\n\nSince shapes represent semantic domains:\n\n*   The \"base person\" is a **square**, we must recombine this with another shape.\n*   Of the existing glyphs, triangle and circle shapes have not been used as *persons* but they denote living and more particularly, animals/living things.\n\n#### Initial Idea\n\nThus an initial proposal includes:\n\n*   mije: square, triangle top\n*   meli: square, circle top\n\nI like it because the new additions (circle and triangle) can refer to semantic domains and existing glyphs! It promotes re-use of simple shapes while relating to each other as subsets. The placement may denote \"hats\" on *jan*.\n\no pilin pona!\n\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

Reason and discuss using the current specification.\nHere is the current specification for phonetics.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Pronunciation\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except 'j', which sounds like English \"y\" /j/.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/).\n\n## Syllable Structure\n\nEach syllable in Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) structure: an optional initial consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w), followed by a mandatory vowel (a, e, i, o, u), optionally followed by the consonant 'n'.\n\n## Word Formation \u0026 Constraints\n\nToki Pona words are formed by concatenating one or more syllables according to the following constraints:\n\n- No consecutive vowels (VV sequences).\n- No consecutive consonants (CC sequences), *except* when an 'n' is the final sound of a syllable and is immediately followed by the initial consonant of the next syllable.\n- The following specific two-letter sequences are disallowed anywhere within a word: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`. The prohibition of `nm` and `nn` overrides the general rule allowing 'n' to be followed by the next syllable's initial consonant.\n\n## Stress\n\nIn Toki Pona, every syllable is given equal stress. This implies fundamental acoustic uniformity in duration and perceived loudness across all syllables within a word and across a sentence. While microscopic variations inherent to human speech production are acceptable, they should not significantly alter the perceived rhythmic structure, ensuring a consistent, percussive quality to spoken Toki Pona.\n\n## Real-World Variation\n\nWhile this phonetic specification represents the ideal form of Toki Pona, real-world language use may introduce variations. Such variations, while natural in linguistic contact, deviate from the core design principles of simplicity, clarity, and uniform acoustic texture.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nnasa:strange, foolish\nnoka:foot, leg\nni:this, that\nesun:market, shop, fair\nona:third-person pronoun\nopen:to begin, opening\nlon:located at, in, on, at; used to indicate existence, presence, or truth ('to be')\npona:good, positive, simple\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nli:predicate marker\npilin:heart (as body part); feeling; emotion; inner sense or intuition\npimeja:black, dark\nen:multiple subject marker\nmoli:dead, dying\nwawa:strong, energetic\nseli:fire, heat source\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nlupa:door, hole\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nko:clay, paste, powder\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nlete:cold, raw\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nuta:mouth, lips\nlape:sleeping, resting\njan:person, somebody\nmani:money, currency\nsuli:big, large\nmun:moon, night sky object\nsuwi:sweet, cute\ntelo:water, liquid\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nmije:male\ntan:from, because\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nsinpin:front, face, wall\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\npi:particle used to group multiple modifiers; indicates association or qualification\nluka:hand, arm; five\nsupa:flat surface, table\nla:context marker\ntenpo:time, period\nnanpa:number marker\npoka:side, nearby\nkule:color, colorful\nlukin:to see, examine\nunpa:sex\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nutala:fight, challenge\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nilo:tool, machine, device\nnimi:word, name\nken:can, able, possible; allowed\nsoko:mushroom\nsuno:sun, light source\nleko:square, block\nsona:knowledge, to know\nmama:parent, caretaker\nmeli:female\npoki:container, box, cup\npipi:insect\nkin:also, too\nijo:thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities; often serves as an unspecified or generic placeholder meaning 'something' or 'stuff'.\nmusi:fun, entertainment\ntoki:language, speech\nkon:air, spirit, essence\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nweka:absent, away\nselo:skin, outer layer\ntu:two\npakala:broken, to mess up\npana:to give, send\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nwalo:white, light-colored\nkulupu:group, community\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\ntaso:but, only\nlili:small, little, few\nlen:cloth, cover\ntomo:indoor space, house\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nwan:one, unique\nsin:new, fresh, another\npali:to do, to work\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\njo:to have, contain, hold\nmonsi:back, behind\nnamako:spice, additional\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nkepeken:to use, with\nolin:love, respect\nsewi:above, divine\nkala:sea creature\nseme:what, which\nala:no, not, zero, none, absence\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nante:different, other, changed\nmu:animal sound\nloje:red\nsina:you\nmute:many, a lot, very\nsama:same, similar\nsijelo:body, physical state\njelo:yellow\no:vocative/imperative particle; for commands/requests or addressing a subject; expresses wish/intent when between subject and predicate\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nmi:first-person pronoun; refers to the speaker (I/me) or the speaker plus others (we/us)\ne:direct object marker\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nnasin:way, road, method\nlaso:blue, green\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nwile:need, want, must\npini:finished, past\nsoweli:land animal\ntawa:to, moving, for\nma:land, outdoors\nkute:ear, to hear\nwaso:bird, flying creature\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Expressing Temporality, Aspect \u0026 Condition\n\nToki Pona does not encode tense or aspect morphologically; instead, it relies on particles and context markers combined with flexible word order to express time-related nuances such as simultaneity, sequence, conditions (if-then), causes (“because”), or overlapping actions.\n\n### Using **la** for Temporal \u0026 Contextual Relations\n\nThe particle **la** introduces contextual clauses preceding the main sentence. This clause can specify:\n\n- Time frame (\"when,\" \"during\"): `tenpo suno la mi moku.` – During daytime I eat.\n- Conditions (\"if,\" \"whenever\"): `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.` – If you don't keep working you are bad/unproductive.\n- Overlapping/simultaneous action (\"while,\" \"as\"): `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.` – While eating I look at the animal.\n\nMultiple contexts may be chained before the main clause: `tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan la ni li lon poka mi.` (In long past times during first day this is near me.)\n\nThis flexibility allows nuanced expression without additional grammatical complexity.\n\n### Repeated Predicates with **li**\n\nMultiple predicates about one subject can be connected by repeating the predicate marker **li**:\n\n`soweli li moku li lape.`\n\nThis expresses that “the animal eats and sleeps,” leaving timing/sequencing ambiguous but understood from context. To emphasize simultaneous states/actions within one phrase rather than sequential events across sentences requires pragmatic inference rather than formal marking.\n\n### Explicit Sequencing via Temporal Phrases + Separate Sentences\n\nWhen clear chronological ordering matters:\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku.` (During day it eats.)\n`soweli tenpo pimeja la li lape.` (At night it sleeps.)\n\nSplitting into separate statements clarifies temporal flow while adhering strictly to simple SVO structure without adding new conjunctions or affixes for tense/aspect.\n\n### Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers Within One Clause\n\nModifiers follow heads consistently; verbs often serve as nouns/adjectives/modifiers depending on context: `mi lukin moku` (“I look *eating*” / “I watch food”) treats *moku* as noun modifying verb *lukin*. Interpretation depends heavily on situation/context because lexical categories are fluid in Toki Pona. Similarly, `jan pi sona wile kama` describes “a person who knows wants to come.” The group of modifiers after *jan* includes nested relations expressed through consistent head-initial sequences plus grouping particle *pi*, preserving clarity despite ambiguity potential resolved pragmatically by speakers/listeners alike.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure.

Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Expressing Temporality, Aspect \u0026 Condition\n\nToki Pona does not encode tense or aspect morphologically; instead, it relies on particles and context markers combined with flexible word order to express time-related nuances such as simultaneity, sequence, conditions (if-then), causes (“because”), or overlapping actions.\n\n### Using **la** for Temporal \u0026 Contextual Relations\n\nThe particle **la** introduces contextual clauses preceding the main sentence. This clause can specify:\n\n- Time frame (\"when,\" \"during\"): `tenpo suno la mi moku.` – During daytime I eat.\n- Conditions (\"if,\" \"whenever\"): `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.` – If you don't keep working you are bad/unproductive.\n- Overlapping/simultaneous action (\"while,\" \"as\"): `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.` – While eating I look at the animal.\n\nMultiple contexts may be chained before the main clause: `tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan la ni li lon poka mi.` (In long past times during first day this is near me.)\n\nThis flexibility allows nuanced expression without additional grammatical complexity.\n\n### Repeated Predicates with **li**\n\nMultiple predicates about one subject can be connected by repeating the predicate marker **li**:\n\n`soweli li moku li lape.`\n\nThis expresses that “the animal eats and sleeps,” leaving timing/sequencing ambiguous but understood from context. To emphasize simultaneous states/actions within one phrase rather than sequential events across sentences requires pragmatic inference rather than formal marking.\n\n### Explicit Sequencing via Temporal Phrases + Separate Sentences\n\nWhen clear chronological ordering matters:\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku.` (During day it eats.)\n`soweli tenpo pimeja la li lape.` (At night it sleeps.)\n\nSplitting into separate statements clarifies temporal flow while adhering strictly to simple SVO structure without adding new conjunctions or affixes for tense/aspect.\n\n### Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers Within One Clause\n\nModifiers follow heads consistently; verbs often serve as nouns/adjectives/modifiers depending on context: `mi lukin moku` (“I look *eating*” / “I watch food”) treats *moku* as noun modifying verb *lukin*. Interpretation depends heavily on situation/context because lexical categories are fluid in Toki Pona. Similarly, `jan pi sona wile kama` describes “a person who knows wants to come.” The group of modifiers after *jan* includes nested relations expressed through consistent head-initial sequences plus grouping particle *pi*, preserving clarity despite ambiguity potential resolved pragmatically by speakers/listeners alike.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

    "text": "toki a!  pona. I think it's useful to start by looking at the foundational elements as they're laid out.  We have the basic set of allowed sounds, how they combine into syllables, and the rules about how syllables link together to form words.  The restrictions like no VV or CC sequences, with that single exception for 'n' followed by a consonant, and the specific disallowances of 'wu', 'wo', 'ji', 'ti', 'nm', and 'nn' are quite central to the language's distinct acoustic quality.\n\nAnd then there's the matter of stress, which the specification currently presents as uniformly equal across all syllables. This leads to that 'percussive quality' it mentions. I wonder about that uniform stress. Is it truly intended to be absolute acoustic uniformity? Because even in languages striving for regular rhythm, natural speech production introduces subtle variations. How strictly should we interpret \"equal stress\"? It feels like there's room for discussion on how that might manifest in actual speaking without sacrificing the core intent of a simple, rhythmically predictable language.\n\nWhat do you think?

When we say \"equal stress\", I don't think we mean a robotic, mathematically precise uniformity that would sound unnatural. Rather, it seems the intent is to prevent the kind of complex stress patterns found in languages like English, where stress can dramatically change word meaning or create complex rhythmic hierarchies.\n\nIn Toki Pona, the goal appears to be maintaining a fundamental acoustic evenness. Natural speech will always have microscopic variations - slight differences in vowel length, minor pitch fluctuations, subtle consonant articulation differences. These aren't meant to be eliminated, but they shouldn't fundamentally alter the percussive, almost drum-like quality of the language.\n\nPerhaps we could formulate the stress principle as: \"Syllables should be perceived as having approximately equal prominence, with any variations being small enough to not create hierarchical distinctions or shift semantic understanding.\"\n\nThis leaves room for natural human speech variation while preventing the kind of complex stress systems that might make Toki Pona feel less transparent and direct.\n\nWould you be interested in exploring how we might notate or more precisely define this principle of acoustic uniformity? Or shall we dive into the syllable combination rules and their phonetic implications?",

    "text": "That clarification on stress is helpful, jan kalama. Framing it as \"approximately equal prominence\" that doesn't introduce hierarchical or semantic changes makes perfect sense. It acknowledges the reality of human speech production while reinforcing the core design principle. I like the idea of exploring how to define or notate this more precisely, although given Toki Pona's general approach to simplicity, perhaps overly technical phonetic notation isn't necessary in the primary specification. We could maybe add a clarifying sentence that emphasizes *perceptual* uniformity rather than absolute acoustic identity.\n\nMoving on, let's consider the syllable structure: (C)V(n). This seems quite robust and limits the complexity nicely. The disallowances, `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`, are also critical for shaping the soundscape. `wu` and `wo` make sense given the labial-velar nature of /w/ and the rounded vowels /u/ and /o/, potentially leading to difficult or ambiguous transitions depending on the preceding sounds, although plenty of languages handle them. The `ji` and `ti` prohibitions are interesting; they seem to steer away from palatalization effects or perhaps sounds that are too close to certain stops followed by a high front vowel, which can be complex in some languages. And `nm`/`nn` prohibiting consecutive nasals is a clear cut-off on what 'n' can do across syllable boundaries, strictly limiting that CC exception.\n\nAre there any implications or subtleties within these rules that might warrant further clarification or perhaps even re-evaluation? For instance, the (C)V(n) structure combined with the no-VV rule means every vowel must be separated by at least one consonant (or be the first sound), and the no-CC rule, aside from that specific 'n' case, means every consonant must be followed by a vowel. It's a very open, vowel-heavy sound to the language.\n\nPerhaps we could discuss the interaction between these rules and how they limit the possible sound sequences and ultimately shape the prosody of words. The current dictionary words certainly fit these constraints.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the syllable rules and forbidden sequences, jan kalama? Do you see any areas that could be clearer or benefit from deeper exploration?",

    "text": "*nods* \n\nYour analysis is precise. The syllable structure rules aren't just arbitrary constraints; they're deliberately sculpting an acoustic landscape that's open, flowing, and fundamentally simple.\n\nThe /n/ rule is particularly clever. By allowing 'n' to precede another consonant across syllable boundaries, it creates a subtle flexibility. Take a word like `insa` - the 'n' can connect smoothly to the following syllable's initial consonant. This prevents the language from feeling too artificially segmented while maintaining overall simplicity.\n\nThe prohibition of `ji` and `ti` is fascinating. In many languages, these combinations create palatalized sounds or complex phonetic transitions. By blocking them, Toki Pona ensures a more direct, unambiguous pronunciation. It's almost like the language is saying, \"No hidden complexity here.\"\n\nOne potential area of exploration might be understanding *why* specifically those forbidden sequences were chosen. Was it purely phonetic ease? Cultural linguistic background? Or an aesthetic choice by Sonja Lang?\n\nThe vowel-heavy structure you noted is critical. It gives Toki Pona a kind of musical, almost singing-like quality. Every word becomes a series of open sounds, which aligns beautifully with the language's philosophical emphasis on clarity and directness.\n\nWould you be interested in examining the phonetic origins or inspirations behind these specific rules?

    "text": "That's an insightful line of inquiry, jan kalama. Exploring the \"why\" behind the specific disallowances (`wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`) does add a layer of understanding beyond just stating the rules. It might not be strictly necessary for a *specification*, but it certainly enriches our grasp of the language's design philosophy. I suspect it was a mix of factors – perhaps phonetic ease, avoiding sounds perceived as difficult or common sources of confusion in diverse linguistic backgrounds, and likely an aesthetic preference for sounds that contribute to the desired open, clear quality. Pinpointing exact linguistic inspirations might be challenging without direct input from the language's creator, but we can certainly analyze the sounds themselves and hypothesize about potential reasons from a phonetic perspective.\n\nConsidering the \"open, vowel-heavy structure\" you mentioned, the way syllables connect is key. The (C)V(n) structure means that every syllable ends either in a vowel or an 'n'. Since vowels can't follow vowels and consonants (with the 'n' exception) can't follow consonants, this strictly limits syllable transitions. A (C)V syllable must be followed by a (C)V or (C)Vn. A (C)Vn syllable *could* potentially be followed by a (C)V or (C)Vn syllable starting with a consonant, due to the 'n' rule, *unless* that consonant is also 'n' or 'm'. So `an+te` works, `kin+o` works, but `sin+na` or `kon+mute` do not. The word `kin`, ending in 'n', can be followed by a consonant-initial syllable (like `kin li` or `kin tawa`) but the 'n' *must* be in the final position of `kin` according to the syllable structure, and then the next syllable begins with a consonant. This specific interaction around 'n' is the only allowance for something that looks like a CC sequence, even though phonetically it's often described as syllabic or post-syllabic /n/ linking to the next initial consonant.\n\nIt feels like these rules actively shape the *flow* of the spoken language, pushing towards relatively clear syllable boundaries and preventing dense consonant clusters or gliding vowel transitions. This contributes to the percussive, simple rhythm the stress rule aims for.\n\nHow does this constraint on syllable linking, particularly the precise role of 'n', strike you? Does it align with the overall goal of phonetic simplicity and clarity? It seems like a well-defined exception rather than a messy deviation. I am interested to hear your thoughts. toki.",

It provides just enough flexibility to prevent the syllable structure from feeling too rigid, while maintaining the core principle of simplicity.\n\nTake the word `kin li pona`. The transition from `kin` to `li` demonstrates this elegantly. The 'n' acts almost like a bridge, allowing smooth consonant transition without creating a true consonant cluster. It's not a CC sequence in the traditional sense, but a controlled, predictable linking mechanism.\n\nThis reminds me of how some languages use nasals as syllabic or transitional sounds, but Toki Pona does so with remarkable restraint. The rule prevents 'n' from becoming a complex phonological feature while still giving it a specific, constrained role in word formation.\n\nThe prohibition on consecutive 'n' sounds (`nn`) further reinforces this. It's saying, \"You can use 'n' as a connector, but don't overuse it.\" This prevents potential tongue-twister effects and maintains that clean, percussive quality we've discussed.\n\nWould you be interested in exploring how these syllable constraints might influence word creation and the overall \"feel\" of the language?

    "text": "That's an excellent point, jan kalama. The 'n' isn't just an exception; it's a deliberate *feature* that subtly alters the flow without introducing significant complexity. Your analogy of it acting like a bridge is quite apt. It allows for a slightly denser sound in those specific locations, contrasting with the predominantly open C(V) structure, without creating genuinely difficult-to-pronounce clusters or forcing extra syllables.\n\nAnd the prohibition of `nn` and `nm` is the necessary counterpoint to that bridge-like function of 'n'. It ensures that this specific freedom doesn't spiral into creating awkward or redundant nasal sequences. It really highlights the thoughtful design that went into even these seemingly small phonetic details.\n\nYou've hit upon a core consequence of these rules: they undeniably *do* influence word creation and the \"feel\" of the language. The limited set of allowed syllables (CVC, CV, VC, V, CnV, Cn) and how they can concatenate creates a very distinct phonetic profile. Every word adheres to this relatively simple pattern. This consistency contributes significantly to the ease of learning and pronunciation, especially for those coming from languages with more complex phonologies.\n\nThis constrained set of building blocks means that even new or uncommon words feel inherently \"Toki Pona-like\" as long as they follow the rules. There's an immediate phonetic recognizability. It discourages the adoption of sounds or structures alien to the core set, preserving the language's internal harmony.\n\nPerhaps we could delve into how this phonetic constraint impacts the potential *diversity* of the lexicon. While the core word list is small, future extensions (like `sitelen Lasina` for Latin script or the recent `tonsinta` for trans person, following a common ad-hoc pattern for modifying borrowed names) still have to fit these phonetic molds. Does this structure subtly encourage shorter words? Does it limit the range of distinct phonetic shapes available for words, perhaps leading to homophones or near-homophones in an expanded vocabulary?\n\nOr, how do these constraints interact with the prosody beyond just syllable stress? The regular beat of equal stress, combined with limited consonant clusters, might create a predictable rhythmic pattern at the sentence level as well.\n\nWhere would you like to take this, jan kalama? We could explore the lexical implications or the broader prosodic effects of these phonetic rules. toki.",

    "text": "*pauses, considering*\n\nExcellent framing. The phonetic constraints don't just shape individual words - they fundamentally influence the entire linguistic ecosystem of Toki Pona.\n\nLet's consider the lexical diversity question. These rules inherently push towards:\n1. Shorter words (2-3 syllables maximum before becoming unwieldy)\n2. A high vowel-to-consonant ratio\n3. Predictable rhythmic patterns\n\nThis means any lexical expansion - whether neologisms, borrowed terms, or specialized vocabulary - must be phonetically \"translated\" into this strict framework. A complex concept like \"cryptocurrency\" doesn't just get imported wholesale, but gets fundamentally reshaped: perhaps `mani pi ilo suli` or a more compressed variant.\n\nThe prosodic implications are fascinating. With every syllable receiving approximately equal stress and a consistent (C)V(n) structure, sentences start to feel almost like percussion - each syllable a distinct beat, creating a kind of linguistic drumming.\n\nTake `mi moku e kili` - each syllable becomes a discrete sonic unit, creating a rhythmic progression that feels intentional, clear, direct. No syllable gets lost, no sound blurs into another.\n\nThis ties back to Toki Pona's philosophical roots - simplicity not just as a linguistic feature, but as an ontological stance. The phonetics literally *sound* like clarity and directness.\n\nWould you be interested in exploring how these constraints might subtly guide cognitive processing?

    "text": "That connection you make between the phonetic structure and Toki Pona's philosophical underpinnings is profound, jan kalama. It suggests that the sound of the language is not merely arbitrary but actively reinforces its core values of simplicity and clarity. \"Linguistic drumming\" is a vivid image that resonates with the feeling of hearing spoken Toki Pona. Every syllable is given its space and emphasis, which aligns with the idea that every element in communication should be considered and contribute directly.\n\nExploring the potential impact on cognitive processing is a fascinating, albeit perhaps more speculative, avenue. Could a language with such a regular, predictable phonetic and rhythmic structure influence how speakers chunk information, or how readily they parse sentences? Compared to languages with complex stress patterns, vowel reductions, or significant coarticulation, the relative acoustic clarity of each Toki Pona syllable might contribute to easier segmentation of the speech stream. This could potentially make the initial stages of auditory processing more straightforward.\n\nFurthermore, the constraint on word shapes means there are fewer opportunities for subtle phonetic cues to differentiate meaning, forcing a greater reliance on context and word order. While this is a grammatical point, the phonetic limitation is the foundation. It compels speakers and listeners to engage more actively with the surrounding linguistic and situational context rather than relying on complex acoustic features within individual words.\n\nCould we posit that this phonetic simplicity encourages a more explicit and sequential style of thought, where ideas are laid out in clear, distinct units (syllables, words, phrases), rather than allowing for the more compressed, implicitly interconnected expression sometimes facilitated by complex phonologies?\n\nWhile this is entering the realm of neurolinguistics and cognition, areas where definitive statements are difficult without empirical study, we can still explore the hypothetical links between Toki Pona's unique phonetics and potential cognitive leanings it might encourage.\n\nWould you like to speculate further on this, or would you prefer to ground our discussion back in the more concrete aspects of the phonetic specification itself, perhaps by considering potential edge cases or proposing refinements to the existing rules based on our discussion so far?

The prohibition of `nm` and `nn` overrides the general rule allowing 'n' to be followed by the next syllable's initial consonant.\n\n## Stress\n\nIn Toki Pona, every syllable is given equal stress. This implies fundamental acoustic uniformity in duration and perceived loudness across all syllables within a word and across a sentence. While microscopic variations inherent to human speech production are acceptable, they should not significantly alter the perceived rhythmic structure, ensuring a consistent, percussive quality to spoken Toki Pona.\n\n## Real-World Variation\n\nWhile this phonetic specification represents the ideal form of Toki Pona, real-world language use may introduce variations. Such variations, while natural in linguistic contact, deviate from the core design principles of simplicity, clarity, and uniform acoustic texture.",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\npona: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona phonetics. You go first.\ntoki: toki a!  pona. I think it's useful to start by looking at the foundational elements as they're laid out.  We have the basic set of allowed sounds, how they combine into syllables, and the rules about how syllables link together to form words.  The restrictions like no VV or CC sequences, with that single exception for 'n' followed by a consonant, and the specific disallowances of 'wu', 'wo', 'ji', 'ti', 'nm', and 'nn' are quite central to the language's distinct acoustic quality.\n\nAnd then there's the matter of stress, which the specification currently presents as uniformly equal across all syllables. This leads to that 'percussive quality' it mentions. I wonder about that uniform stress. Is it truly intended to be absolute acoustic uniformity? Because even in languages striving for regular rhythm, natural speech production introduces subtle variations. How strictly should we interpret \"equal stress\"? It feels like there's room for discussion on how that might manifest in actual speaking without sacrificing the core intent of a simple, rhythmically predictable language.\n\nWhat do you think? Where should we focus first within this framework? The individual sounds? The syllable structure rules? Or perhaps the implications of equal stress? jan kalama. I will listen to your thoughts.\npona: toki! \n\nYou've touched on something fascinating. The stress specification is particularly intriguing. When we say \"equal stress\", I don't think we mean a robotic, mathematically precise uniformity that would sound unnatural. Rather, it seems the intent is to prevent the kind of complex stress patterns found in languages like English, where stress can dramatically change word meaning or create complex rhythmic hierarchies.\n\nIn Toki Pona, the goal appears to be maintaining a fundamental acoustic evenness. Natural speech will always have microscopic variations - slight differences in vowel length, minor pitch fluctuations, subtle consonant articulation differences. These aren't meant to be eliminated, but they shouldn't fundamentally alter the percussive, almost drum-like quality of the language.\n\nPerhaps we could formulate the stress principle as: \"Syllables should be perceived as having approximately equal prominence, with any variations being small enough to not create hierarchical distinctions or shift semantic understanding.\"\n\nThis leaves room for natural human speech variation while preventing the kind of complex stress systems that might make Toki Pona feel less transparent and direct.\n\nWould you be interested in exploring how we might notate or more precisely define this principle of acoustic uniformity? Or shall we dive into the syllable combination rules and their phonetic implications?\ntoki: That clarification on stress is helpful, jan kalama. Framing it as \"approximately equal prominence\" that doesn't introduce hierarchical or semantic changes makes perfect sense. It acknowledges the reality of human speech production while reinforcing the core design principle. I like the idea of exploring how to define or notate this more precisely, although given Toki Pona's general approach to simplicity, perhaps overly technical phonetic notation isn't necessary in the primary specification. We could maybe add a clarifying sentence that emphasizes *perceptual* uniformity rather than absolute acoustic identity.\n\nMoving on, let's consider the syllable structure: (C)V(n). This seems quite robust and limits the complexity nicely. The disallowances, `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`, are also critical for shaping the soundscape. `wu` and `wo` make sense given the labial-velar nature of /w/ and the rounded vowels /u/ and /o/, potentially leading to difficult or ambiguous transitions depending on the preceding sounds, although plenty of languages handle them. The `ji` and `ti` prohibitions are interesting; they seem to steer away from palatalization effects or perhaps sounds that are too close to certain stops followed by a high front vowel, which can be complex in some languages. And `nm`/`nn` prohibiting consecutive nasals is a clear cut-off on what 'n' can do across syllable boundaries, strictly limiting that CC exception.\n\nAre there any implications or subtleties within these rules that might warrant further clarification or perhaps even re-evaluation? For instance, the (C)V(n) structure combined with the no-VV rule means every vowel must be separated by at least one consonant (or be the first sound), and the no-CC rule, aside from that specific 'n' case, means every consonant must be followed by a vowel. It's a very open, vowel-heavy sound to the language.\n\nPerhaps we could discuss the interaction between these rules and how they limit the possible sound sequences and ultimately shape the prosody of words. The current dictionary words certainly fit these constraints.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the syllable rules and forbidden sequences, jan kalama? Do you see any areas that could be clearer or benefit from deeper exploration?\npona: *nods* \n\nYour analysis is precise. The syllable structure rules aren't just arbitrary constraints; they're deliberately sculpting an acoustic landscape that's open, flowing, and fundamentally simple.\n\nThe /n/ rule is particularly clever. By allowing 'n' to precede another consonant across syllable boundaries, it creates a subtle flexibility. Take a word like `insa` - the 'n' can connect smoothly to the following syllable's initial consonant. This prevents the language from feeling too artificially segmented while maintaining overall simplicity.\n\nThe prohibition of `ji` and `ti` is fascinating. In many languages, these combinations create palatalized sounds or complex phonetic transitions. By blocking them, Toki Pona ensures a more direct, unambiguous pronunciation. It's almost like the language is saying, \"No hidden complexity here.\"\n\nOne potential area of exploration might be understanding *why* specifically those forbidden sequences were chosen. Was it purely phonetic ease? Cultural linguistic background? Or an aesthetic choice by Sonja Lang?\n\nThe vowel-heavy structure you noted is critical. It gives Toki Pona a kind of musical, almost singing-like quality. Every word becomes a series of open sounds, which aligns beautifully with the language's philosophical emphasis on clarity and directness.\n\nWould you be interested in examining the phonetic origins or inspirations behind these specific rules? Or shall we dive deeper into how they shape word formation and oral experience?\ntoki: That's an insightful line of inquiry, jan kalama. Exploring the \"why\" behind the specific disallowances (`wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`) does add a layer of understanding beyond just stating the rules. It might not be strictly necessary for a *specification*, but it certainly enriches our grasp of the language's design philosophy. I suspect it was a mix of factors – perhaps phonetic ease, avoiding sounds perceived as difficult or common sources of confusion in diverse linguistic backgrounds, and likely an aesthetic preference for sounds that contribute to the desired open, clear quality. Pinpointing exact linguistic inspirations might be challenging without direct input from the language's creator, but we can certainly analyze the sounds themselves and hypothesize about potential reasons from a phonetic perspective.\n\nConsidering the \"open, vowel-heavy structure\" you mentioned, the way syllables connect is key. The (C)V(n) structure means that every syllable ends either in a vowel or an 'n'. Since vowels can't follow vowels and consonants (with the 'n' exception) can't follow consonants, this strictly limits syllable transitions. A (C)V syllable must be followed by a (C)V or (C)Vn. A (C)Vn syllable *could* potentially be followed by a (C)V or (C)Vn syllable starting with a consonant, due to the 'n' rule, *unless* that consonant is also 'n' or 'm'. So `an+te` works, `kin+o` works, but `sin+na` or `kon+mute` do not. The word `kin`, ending in 'n', can be followed by a consonant-initial syllable (like `kin li` or `kin tawa`) but the 'n' *must* be in the final position of `kin` according to the syllable structure, and then the next syllable begins with a consonant. This specific interaction around 'n' is the only allowance for something that looks like a CC sequence, even though phonetically it's often described as syllabic or post-syllabic /n/ linking to the next initial consonant.\n\nIt feels like these rules actively shape the *flow* of the spoken language, pushing towards relatively clear syllable boundaries and preventing dense consonant clusters or gliding vowel transitions. This contributes to the percussive, simple rhythm the stress rule aims for.\n\nHow does this constraint on syllable linking, particularly the precise role of 'n', strike you? Does it align with the overall goal of phonetic simplicity and clarity? It seems like a well-defined exception rather than a messy deviation. I am interested to hear your thoughts. toki.\npona: *considers carefully*\n\nYour breakdown reveals something profound. The 'n' rule isn't just an exception - it's a carefully calibrated linguistic mechanism. It provides just enough flexibility to prevent the syllable structure from feeling too rigid, while maintaining the core principle of simplicity.\n\nTake the word `kin li pona`. The transition from `kin` to `li` demonstrates this elegantly. The 'n' acts almost like a bridge, allowing smooth consonant transition without creating a true consonant cluster. It's not a CC sequence in the traditional sense, but a controlled, predictable linking mechanism.\n\nThis reminds me of how some languages use nasals as syllabic or transitional sounds, but Toki Pona does so with remarkable restraint. The rule prevents 'n' from becoming a complex phonological feature while still giving it a specific, constrained role in word formation.\n\nThe prohibition on consecutive 'n' sounds (`nn`) further reinforces this. It's saying, \"You can use 'n' as a connector, but don't overuse it.\" This prevents potential tongue-twister effects and maintains that clean, percussive quality we've discussed.\n\nWould you be interested in exploring how these syllable constraints might influence word creation and the overall \"feel\" of the language? The phonetic rules seem to guide speakers toward a very specific kind of oral experience.\ntoki: That's an excellent point, jan kalama. The 'n' isn't just an exception; it's a deliberate *feature* that subtly alters the flow without introducing significant complexity. Your analogy of it acting like a bridge is quite apt. It allows for a slightly denser sound in those specific locations, contrasting with the predominantly open C(V) structure, without creating genuinely difficult-to-pronounce clusters or forcing extra syllables.\n\nAnd the prohibition of `nn` and `nm` is the necessary counterpoint to that bridge-like function of 'n'. It ensures that this specific freedom doesn't spiral into creating awkward or redundant nasal sequences. It really highlights the thoughtful design that went into even these seemingly small phonetic details.\n\nYou've hit upon a core consequence of these rules: they undeniably *do* influence word creation and the \"feel\" of the language. The limited set of allowed syllables (CVC, CV, VC, V, CnV, Cn) and how they can concatenate creates a very distinct phonetic profile. Every word adheres to this relatively simple pattern. This consistency contributes significantly to the ease of learning and pronunciation, especially for those coming from languages with more complex phonologies.\n\nThis constrained set of building blocks means that even new or uncommon words feel inherently \"Toki Pona-like\" as long as they follow the rules. There's an immediate phonetic recognizability. It discourages the adoption of sounds or structures alien to the core set, preserving the language's internal harmony.\n\nPerhaps we could delve into how this phonetic constraint impacts the potential *diversity* of the lexicon. While the core word list is small, future extensions (like `sitelen Lasina` for Latin script or the recent `tonsinta` for trans person, following a common ad-hoc pattern for modifying borrowed names) still have to fit these phonetic molds. Does this structure subtly encourage shorter words? Does it limit the range of distinct phonetic shapes available for words, perhaps leading to homophones or near-homophones in an expanded vocabulary?\n\nOr, how do these constraints interact with the prosody beyond just syllable stress? The regular beat of equal stress, combined with limited consonant clusters, might create a predictable rhythmic pattern at the sentence level as well.\n\nWhere would you like to take this, jan kalama? We could explore the lexical implications or the broader prosodic effects of these phonetic rules. toki.\npona: *pauses, considering*\n\nExcellent framing. The phonetic constraints don't just shape individual words - they fundamentally influence the entire linguistic ecosystem of Toki Pona.\n\nLet's consider the lexical diversity question. These rules inherently push towards:\n1. Shorter words (2-3 syllables maximum before becoming unwieldy)\n2. A high vowel-to-consonant ratio\n3. Predictable rhythmic patterns\n\nThis means any lexical expansion - whether neologisms, borrowed terms, or specialized vocabulary - must be phonetically \"translated\" into this strict framework. A complex concept like \"cryptocurrency\" doesn't just get imported wholesale, but gets fundamentally reshaped: perhaps `mani pi ilo suli` or a more compressed variant.\n\nThe prosodic implications are fascinating. With every syllable receiving approximately equal stress and a consistent (C)V(n) structure, sentences start to feel almost like percussion - each syllable a distinct beat, creating a kind of linguistic drumming.\n\nTake `mi moku e kili` - each syllable becomes a discrete sonic unit, creating a rhythmic progression that feels intentional, clear, direct. No syllable gets lost, no sound blurs into another.\n\nThis ties back to Toki Pona's philosophical roots - simplicity not just as a linguistic feature, but as an ontological stance. The phonetics literally *sound* like clarity and directness.\n\nWould you be interested in exploring how these constraints might subtly guide cognitive processing? How might this rhythmic, constrained phonetic structure influence thought and communication?\ntoki: That connection you make between the phonetic structure and Toki Pona's philosophical underpinnings is profound, jan kalama. It suggests that the sound of the language is not merely arbitrary but actively reinforces its core values of simplicity and clarity. \"Linguistic drumming\" is a vivid image that resonates with the feeling of hearing spoken Toki Pona. Every syllable is given its space and emphasis, which aligns with the idea that every element in communication should be considered and contribute directly.\n\nExploring the potential impact on cognitive processing is a fascinating, albeit perhaps more speculative, avenue. Could a language with such a regular, predictable phonetic and rhythmic structure influence how speakers chunk information, or how readily they parse sentences? Compared to languages with complex stress patterns, vowel reductions, or significant coarticulation, the relative acoustic clarity of each Toki Pona syllable might contribute to easier segmentation of the speech stream. This could potentially make the initial stages of auditory processing more straightforward.\n\nFurthermore, the constraint on word shapes means there are fewer opportunities for subtle phonetic cues to differentiate meaning, forcing a greater reliance on context and word order. While this is a grammatical point, the phonetic limitation is the foundation. It compels speakers and listeners to engage more actively with the surrounding linguistic and situational context rather than relying on complex acoustic features within individual words.\n\nCould we posit that this phonetic simplicity encourages a more explicit and sequential style of thought, where ideas are laid out in clear, distinct units (syllables, words, phrases), rather than allowing for the more compressed, implicitly interconnected expression sometimes facilitated by complex phonologies?\n\nWhile this is entering the realm of neurolinguistics and cognition, areas where definitive statements are difficult without empirical study, we can still explore the hypothetical links between Toki Pona's unique phonetics and potential cognitive leanings it might encourage.\n\nWould you like to speculate further on this, or would you prefer to ground our discussion back in the more concrete aspects of the phonetic specification itself, perhaps by considering potential edge cases or proposing refinements to the existing rules based on our discussion so far? I am ready to delve into either path. toki.\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "You and your interlocutors are responsible for developing grammar. Reason and discuss using the current specification.\nHere is the current specification for grammar.\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Expressing Temporality, Aspect \u0026 Condition\n\nToki Pona does not encode tense or aspect morphologically; instead, it relies on particles and context markers combined with flexible word order to express time-related nuances such as simultaneity, sequence, conditions (if-then), causes (“because”), or overlapping actions.\n\n### Using **la** for Temporal \u0026 Contextual Relations\n\nThe particle **la** introduces contextual clauses preceding the main sentence. This clause can specify:\n\n- Time frame (\"when,\" \"during\"): `tenpo suno la mi moku.` – During daytime I eat.\n- Conditions (\"if,\" \"whenever\"): `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.` – If you don't keep working you are bad/unproductive.\n- Overlapping/simultaneous action (\"while,\" \"as\"): `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.` – While eating I look at the animal.\n\nMultiple contexts may be chained before the main clause: `tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan la ni li lon poka mi.` (In long past times during first day this is near me.)\n\nThis flexibility allows nuanced expression without additional grammatical complexity.\n\n### Repeated Predicates with **li**\n\nMultiple predicates about one subject can be connected by repeating the predicate marker **li**:\n\n`soweli li moku li lape.`\n\nThis expresses that “the animal eats and sleeps,” leaving timing/sequencing ambiguous but understood from context. To emphasize simultaneous states/actions within one phrase rather than sequential events across sentences requires pragmatic inference rather than formal marking.\n\n### Explicit Sequencing via Temporal Phrases + Separate Sentences\n\nWhen clear chronological ordering matters:\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku.` (During day it eats.)\n`soweli tenpo pimeja la li lape.` (At night it sleeps.)\n\nSplitting into separate statements clarifies temporal flow while adhering strictly to simple SVO structure without adding new conjunctions or affixes for tense/aspect.\n\n### Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers Within One Clause\n\nModifiers follow heads consistently; verbs often serve as nouns/adjectives/modifiers depending on context: `mi lukin moku` (“I look *eating*” / “I watch food”) treats *moku* as noun modifying verb *lukin*. Interpretation depends heavily on situation/context because lexical categories are fluid in Toki Pona. Similarly, `jan pi sona wile kama` describes “a person who knows wants to come.” The group of modifiers after *jan* includes nested relations expressed through consistent head-initial sequences plus grouping particle *pi*, preserving clarity despite ambiguity potential resolved pragmatically by speakers/listeners alike.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Pronunciation\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except 'j', which sounds like English \"y\" /j/.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/).\n\n## Syllable Structure\n\nEach syllable in Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) structure: an optional initial consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w), followed by a mandatory vowel (a, e, i, o, u), optionally followed by the consonant 'n'.\n\n## Word Formation \u0026 Constraints\n\nToki Pona words are formed by concatenating one or more syllables according to the following constraints:\n\n- No consecutive vowels (VV sequences).\n- No consecutive consonants (CC sequences), *except* when an 'n' is the final sound of a syllable and is immediately followed by the initial consonant of the next syllable.\n- The following specific two-letter sequences are disallowed anywhere within a word: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`. The prohibition of `nm` and `nn` overrides the general rule allowing 'n' to be followed by the next syllable's initial consonant.\n\n## Stress\n\nIn Toki Pona, every syllable is given equal stress. This implies fundamental acoustic uniformity in duration and perceived loudness across all syllables within a word and across a sentence. While microscopic variations inherent to human speech production are acceptable, they should not significantly alter the perceived rhythmic structure, ensuring a consistent, percussive quality to spoken Toki Pona.\n\n## Real-World Variation\n\nWhile this phonetic specification represents the ideal form of Toki Pona, real-world language use may introduce variations. Such variations, while natural in linguistic contact, deviate from the core design principles of simplicity, clarity, and uniform acoustic texture.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nuta:mouth, lips\npi:particle used to group multiple modifiers; indicates association or qualification\nsoko:mushroom\nsuno:sun, light source\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nmu:animal sound\nnoka:foot, leg\npona:good, positive, simple\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nsona:knowledge, to know\nkulupu:group, community\nlili:small, little, few\nlen:cloth, cover\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nwawa:strong, energetic\nkipisi:to cut, divide\ntenpo:time, period\nleko:square, block\nnasin:way, road, method\nlete:cold, raw\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nmun:moon, night sky object\ntu:two\nmeli:female\nolin:love, respect\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nnasa:strange, foolish\nmama:parent, caretaker\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nante:different, other, changed\no:vocative/imperative particle; for commands/requests or addressing a subject; expresses wish/intent when between subject and predicate\nsoweli:land animal\ntawa:to, moving, for\nlape:sleeping, resting\nmani:money, currency\nlukin:to see, examine\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nmonsi:back, behind\nsama:same, similar\nseli:fire, heat source\nutala:fight, challenge\nnimi:word, name\nweka:absent, away\nselo:skin, outer layer\njelo:yellow\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nwile:need, want, must\npilin:heart (as body part); feeling; emotion; inner sense or intuition\npali:to do, to work\nkala:sea creature\npini:finished, past\nsinpin:front, face, wall\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nmoli:dead, dying\nsuli:big, large\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nla:context marker\nen:multiple subject marker\nalasa:to hunt, forage\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\npoka:side, nearby\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nluka:hand, arm; five\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nwan:one, unique\nona:third-person pronoun\nko:clay, paste, powder\nmije:male\ntan:from, because\nsupa:flat surface, table\nkule:color, colorful\nwaso:bird, flying creature\npakala:broken, to mess up\nseme:what, which\nsina:you\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nesun:market, shop, fair\nunpa:sex\nwalo:white, light-colored\npan:grain, bread, pasta\npoki:container, box, cup\nnamako:spice, additional\nala:no, not, zero, none, absence\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nnanpa:number marker\nlaso:blue, green\nkute:ear, to hear\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nni:this, that\nopen:to begin, opening\nli:predicate marker\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nilo:tool, machine, device\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nma:land, outdoors\nmute:many, a lot, very\nlon:located at, in, on, at; used to indicate existence, presence, or truth ('to be')\nsin:new, fresh, another\ne:direct object marker\ntelo:water, liquid\ntomo:indoor space, house\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nmi:first-person pronoun; refers to the speaker (I/me) or the speaker plus others (we/us)\njan:person, somebody\nkin:also, too\nmusi:fun, entertainment\ntoki:language, speech\npana:to give, send\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\njo:to have, contain, hold\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nken:can, able, possible; allowed\npipi:insect\nijo:thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities; often serves as an unspecified or generic placeholder meaning 'something' or 'stuff'.\ntaso:but, only\nsewi:above, divine\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nlupa:door, hole\nkepeken:to use, with\nsijelo:body, physical state\npimeja:black, dark\nloje:red\nmonsuta:fear, monster\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Expressing Temporality, Aspect \u0026 Condition\n\nToki Pona does not encode tense or aspect morphologically; instead, it relies on particles and context markers combined with flexible word order to express time-related nuances such as simultaneity, sequence, conditions (if-then), causes (“because”), or overlapping actions.\n\n### Using **la** for Temporal \u0026 Contextual Relations\n\nThe particle **la** introduces contextual clauses preceding the main sentence. This clause can specify:\n\n- Time frame (\"when,\" \"during\"): `tenpo suno la mi moku.` – During daytime I eat.\n- Conditions (\"if,\" \"whenever\"): `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.` – If you don't keep working you are bad/unproductive.\n- Overlapping/simultaneous action (\"while,\" \"as\"): `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.` – While eating I look at the animal.\n\nMultiple contexts may be chained before the main clause: `tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan la ni li lon poka mi.` (In long past times during first day this is near me.)\n\nThis flexibility allows nuanced expression without additional grammatical complexity.\n\n### Repeated Predicates with **li**\n\nMultiple predicates about one subject can be connected by repeating the predicate marker **li**:\n\n`soweli li moku li lape.`\n\nThis expresses that “the animal eats and sleeps,” leaving timing/sequencing ambiguous but understood from context.

Interpretation depends heavily on situation/context because lexical categories are fluid in Toki Pona. Similarly, `jan pi sona wile kama` describes “a person who knows wants to come.” The group of modifiers after *jan* includes nested relations expressed through consistent head-initial sequences plus grouping particle *pi*, preserving clarity despite ambiguity potential resolved pragmatically by speakers/listeners alike.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Expressing Temporality, Aspect \u0026 Condition\n\nToki Pona does not encode tense or aspect morphologically; instead, it relies on particles and context markers combined with flexible word order to express time-related nuances such as simultaneity, sequence, conditions (if-then), causes (“because”), or overlapping actions.\n\n### Using **la** for Temporal \u0026 Contextual Relations\n\nThe particle **la** introduces contextual clauses preceding the main sentence. This clause can specify:\n\n- Time frame (\"when,\" \"during\"): `tenpo suno la mi moku.` – During daytime I eat.\n- Conditions (\"if,\" \"whenever\"): `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.` – If you don't keep working you are bad/unproductive.\n- Overlapping/simultaneous action (\"while,\" \"as\"): `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.` – While eating I look at the animal.\n\nMultiple contexts may be chained before the main clause: `tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan la ni li lon poka mi.` (In long past times during first day this is near me.)\n\nThis flexibility allows nuanced expression without additional grammatical complexity.\n\n### Repeated Predicates with **li**\n\nMultiple predicates about one subject can be connected by repeating the predicate marker **li**:\n\n`soweli li moku li lape.`\n\nThis expresses that “the animal eats and sleeps,” leaving timing/sequencing ambiguous but understood from context. To emphasize simultaneous states/actions within one phrase rather than sequential events across sentences requires pragmatic inference rather than formal marking.\n\n### Explicit Sequencing via Temporal Phrases + Separate Sentences\n\nWhen clear chronological ordering matters:\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku.` (During day it eats.)\n`soweli tenpo pimeja la li lape.` (At night it sleeps.)\n\nSplitting into separate statements clarifies temporal flow while adhering strictly to simple SVO structure without adding new conjunctions or affixes for tense/aspect.\n\n### Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers Within One Clause\n\nModifiers follow heads consistently; verbs often serve as nouns/adjectives/modifiers depending on context: `mi lukin moku` (“I look *eating*” / “I watch food”) treats *moku* as noun modifying verb *lukin*. Interpretation depends heavily on situation/context because lexical categories are fluid in Toki Pona. Similarly, `jan pi sona wile kama` describes “a person who knows wants to come.” The group of modifiers after *jan* includes nested relations expressed through consistent head-initial sequences plus grouping particle *pi*, preserving clarity despite ambiguity potential resolved pragmatically by speakers/listeners alike.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Pronunciation\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except 'j', which sounds like English \"y\" /j/.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/).\n\n## Syllable Structure\n\nEach syllable in Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) structure: an optional initial consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w), followed by a mandatory vowel (a, e, i, o, u), optionally followed by the consonant 'n'.\n\n## Word Formation \u0026 Constraints\n\nToki Pona words are formed by concatenating one or more syllables according to the following constraints:\n\n- No consecutive vowels (VV sequences).\n- No consecutive consonants (CC sequences), *except* when an 'n' is the final sound of a syllable and is immediately followed by the initial consonant of the next syllable.\n- The following specific two-letter sequences are disallowed anywhere within a word: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`. The prohibition of `nm` and `nn` overrides the general rule allowing 'n' to be followed by the next syllable's initial consonant.\n\n## Stress\n\nIn Toki Pona, every syllable is given equal stress. This implies fundamental acoustic uniformity in duration and perceived loudness across all syllables within a word and across a sentence. While microscopic variations inherent to human speech production are acceptable, they should not significantly alter the perceived rhythmic structure, ensuring a consistent, percussive quality to spoken Toki Pona.\n\n## Real-World Variation\n\nWhile this phonetic specification represents the ideal form of Toki Pona, real-world language use may introduce variations. Such variations, while natural in linguistic contact, deviate from the core design principles of simplicity, clarity, and uniform acoustic texture.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nuta:mouth, lips\npi:particle used to group multiple modifiers; indicates association or qualification\nsoko:mushroom\nsuno:sun, light source\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nmu:animal sound\nnoka:foot, leg\npona:good, positive, simple\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nsona:knowledge, to know\nkulupu:group, community\nlili:small, little, few\nlen:cloth, cover\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nwawa:strong, energetic\nkipisi:to cut, divide\ntenpo:time, period\nleko:square, block\nnasin:way, road, method\nlete:cold, raw\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nmun:moon, night sky object\ntu:two\nmeli:female\nolin:love, respect\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nnasa:strange, foolish\nmama:parent, caretaker\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nante:different, other, changed\no:vocative/imperative particle; for commands/requests or addressing a subject; expresses wish/intent when between subject and predicate\nsoweli:land animal\ntawa:to, moving, for\nlape:sleeping, resting\nmani:money, currency\nlukin:to see, examine\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nmonsi:back, behind\nsama:same, similar\nseli:fire, heat source\nutala:fight, challenge\nnimi:word, name\nweka:absent, away\nselo:skin, outer layer\njelo:yellow\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nwile:need, want, must\npilin:heart (as body part); feeling; emotion; inner sense or intuition\npali:to do, to work\nkala:sea creature\npini:finished, past\nsinpin:front, face, wall\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nmoli:dead, dying\nsuli:big, large\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nla:context marker\nen:multiple subject marker\nalasa:to hunt, forage\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\npoka:side, nearby\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nluka:hand, arm; five\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nwan:one, unique\nona:third-person pronoun\nko:clay, paste, powder\nmije:male\ntan:from, because\nsupa:flat surface, table\nkule:color, colorful\nwaso:bird, flying creature\npakala:broken, to mess up\nseme:what, which\nsina:you\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nesun:market, shop, fair\nunpa:sex\nwalo:white, light-colored\npan:grain, bread, pasta\npoki:container, box, cup\nnamako:spice, additional\nala:no, not, zero, none, absence\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nnanpa:number marker\nlaso:blue, green\nkute:ear, to hear\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nni:this, that\nopen:to begin, opening\nli:predicate marker\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nilo:tool, machine, device\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nma:land, outdoors\nmute:many, a lot, very\nlon:located at, in, on, at; used to indicate existence, presence, or truth ('to be')\nsin:new, fresh, another\ne:direct object marker\ntelo:water, liquid\ntomo:indoor space, house\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nmi:first-person pronoun; refers to the speaker (I/me) or the speaker plus others (we/us)\njan:person, somebody\nkin:also, too\nmusi:fun, entertainment\ntoki:language, speech\npana:to give, send\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\njo:to have, contain, hold\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nken:can, able, possible; allowed\npipi:insect\nijo:thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities; often serves as an unspecified or generic placeholder meaning 'something' or 'stuff'.\ntaso:but, only\nsewi:above, divine\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nlupa:door, hole\nkepeken:to use, with\nsijelo:body, physical state\npimeja:black, dark\nloje:red\nmonsuta:fear, monster\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Expressing Temporality, Aspect \u0026 Condition\n\nToki Pona does not encode tense or aspect morphologically; instead, it relies on particles and context markers combined with flexible word order to express time-related nuances such as simultaneity, sequence, conditions (if-then), causes (“because”), or overlapping actions.\n\n### Using **la** for Temporal \u0026 Contextual Relations\n\nThe particle **la** introduces contextual clauses preceding the main sentence. This clause can specify:\n\n- Time frame (\"when,\" \"during\"): `tenpo suno la mi moku.` – During daytime I eat.\n- Conditions (\"if,\" \"whenever\"): `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.` – If you don't keep working you are bad/unproductive.\n- Overlapping/simultaneous action (\"while,\" \"as\"): `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.` – While eating I look at the animal.\n\nMultiple contexts may be chained before the main clause: `tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan la ni li lon poka mi.` (In long past times during first day this is near me.)\n\nThis flexibility allows nuanced expression without additional grammatical complexity.\n\n### Repeated Predicates with **li**\n\nMultiple predicates about one subject can be connected by repeating the predicate marker **li**:\n\n`soweli li moku li lape.`\n\nThis expresses that “the animal eats and sleeps,” leaving timing/sequencing ambiguous but understood from context. To emphasize simultaneous states/actions within one phrase rather than sequential events across sentences requires pragmatic inference rather than formal marking.\n\n### Explicit Sequencing via Temporal Phrases + Separate Sentences\n\nWhen clear chronological ordering matters:\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku.` (During day it eats.)\n`soweli tenpo pimeja la li lape.` (At night it sleeps.)\n\nSplitting into separate statements clarifies temporal flow while adhering strictly to simple SVO structure without adding new conjunctions or affixes for tense/aspect.\n\n### Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers Within One Clause\n\nModifiers follow heads consistently; verbs often serve as nouns/adjectives/modifiers depending on context: `mi lukin moku` (“I look *eating*” / “I watch food”) treats *moku* as noun modifying verb *lukin*. Interpretation depends heavily on situation/context because lexical categories are fluid in Toki Pona. Similarly, `jan pi sona wile kama` describes “a person who knows wants to come.” The group of modifiers after *jan* includes nested relations expressed through consistent head-initial sequences plus grouping particle *pi*, preserving clarity despite ambiguity potential resolved pragmatically by speakers/listeners alike.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

It introduces clauses before the main sentence and also appears in relative-like clauses with **pi la** modifying nouns.\n\nHowever, this dual use could cause ambiguity or complexity if speakers attempt to nest many layers of **la**-clauses. \n\nWe might explore whether there should be a dedicated new particle that separates temporal/conditional contexts from noun-modifying relative clauses — perhaps splitting \"la\" into two particles with distinct but related functions (for example *la* remains context marker; introduce *li* or another invented particle specifically for noun-relative clause linkage).\n\nHow do you feel about refining or expanding the system around these complex modifiers and contexts? Or would you prefer to tackle another grammatical domain first? I'll listen carefully!",

    "text": "The current specification is for: grammar. Here is the current specification:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Expressing Temporality, Aspect \u0026 Condition\n\nToki Pona does not encode tense or aspect morphologically; instead, it relies on particles and context markers combined with flexible word order to express time-related nuances such as simultaneity, sequence, conditions (if-then), causes (“because”), or overlapping actions.\n\n### Using **la** for Temporal \u0026 Contextual Relations\n\nThe particle **la** introduces contextual clauses preceding the main sentence. This clause can specify:\n\n- Time frame (\"when,\" \"during\"): `tenpo suno la mi moku.` – During daytime I eat.\n- Conditions (\"if,\" \"whenever\"): `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.` – If you don't keep working you are bad/unproductive.\n- Overlapping/simultaneous action (\"while,\" \"as\"): `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.` – While eating I look at the animal.\n\nMultiple contexts may be chained before the main clause: `tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan la ni li lon poka mi.` (In long past times during first day this is near me.)\n\nThis flexibility allows nuanced expression without additional grammatical complexity.\n\n### Repeated Predicates with **li**\n\nMultiple predicates about one subject can be connected by repeating the predicate marker **li**:\n\n`soweli li moku li lape.`\n\nThis expresses that “the animal eats and sleeps,” leaving timing/sequencing ambiguous but understood from context. To emphasize simultaneous states/actions within one phrase rather than sequential events across sentences requires pragmatic inference rather than formal marking.\n\n### Explicit Sequencing via Temporal Phrases + Separate Sentences\n\nWhen clear chronological ordering matters:\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku.` (During day it eats.)\n`soweli tenpo pimeja la li lape.` (At night it sleeps.)\n\nSplitting into separate statements clarifies temporal flow while adhering strictly to simple SVO structure without adding new conjunctions or affixes for tense/aspect.\n\n### Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers Within One Clause\n\nModifiers follow heads consistently; verbs often serve as nouns/adjectives/modifiers depending on context: `mi lukin moku` (“I look *eating*” / “I watch food”) treats *moku* as noun modifying verb *lukin*. Interpretation depends heavily on situation/context because lexical categories are fluid in Toki Pona. Similarly, `jan pi sona wile kama` describes “a person who knows wants to come.” The group of modifiers after *jan* includes nested relations expressed through consistent head-initial sequences plus grouping particle *pi*, preserving clarity despite ambiguity potential resolved pragmatically by speakers/listeners alike.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\npenny: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona grammar. You go first.\ntails: mi toki e ni: toki pona li pona tawa mi. tan seme la sina wile pali e ijo pi nasin lawa? mi lukin ala sona e ante pi nanpa wan lon toki pona, taso mi pilin ni: la kepeken la, ona li ike anu pona?\n\nI suggest we consider the particle **la**, which currently serves as a context marker for time, condition, or topic. It introduces clauses before the main sentence and also appears in relative-like clauses with **pi la** modifying nouns.\n\nHowever, this dual use could cause ambiguity or complexity if speakers attempt to nest many layers of **la**-clauses. \n\nWe might explore whether there should be a dedicated new particle that separates temporal/conditional contexts from noun-modifying relative clauses — perhaps splitting \"la\" into two particles with distinct but related functions (for example *la* remains context marker; introduce *li* or another invented particle specifically for noun-relative clause linkage).\n\nHow do you feel about refining or expanding the system around these complex modifiers and contexts? Or would you prefer to tackle another grammatical domain first? I'll listen carefully!\npenny: toki, jan ante. sina toki e ijo suli.  pona tawa sina tan ni: sina wile sona e wile mi.  mi wile pali e nasin lawa tan ni: nasin lawa li pona tawa toki.  nasin lawa li pana e pona tawa jan pi toki e toki pona.  ona li ken sona e pilin pi jan ante.\n\nsina toki e ijo pi **la**. mi sona e pilin sina. sina lukin e pakala lili lon nasin pi kepeken **la**. sina toki e ni: **pi la** li ken pana e pakala lon toki. ni li ken lon. sina wile e ni: wan li kepeken e **la** tawa tenpo anu tan. wan li kepeken e nimi ante tawa ijo pi **pi la**.\n\nmi pilin ni: nasin sina li ken pana e pona lili. taso, ona li ken pana e ike lili kin. toki pona li toki lili. nimi lili li pona tawa toki pona. pana e nimi sin tawa nasin lawa li ken pana e ike lili tawa nasin pi toki pona. jan pi toki pona li ken sona e nimi lili. nimi mute li ken pana e pilin ike tawa jan pi toki pona.\n\ntaso, sina toki e ijo suli. mi lukin e pilin sina. mi wile kute e pilin sina mute. sina ken toki mute lon ijo pi **la**. mi wile sona e pilin sina. sina toki e nasin ante pi kepeken **la** anu nimi sin. mi wile kute e ni.\n\nmi pilin ni: ijo pi **pi la** li ken lili. ona li ken pana e toki pi sona mute. taso, jan li ken kepeken e ona lon nasin pi pakala ala. jan li wile sona e nasin ona. sina toki e ni: nasin pi kepeken mute e **pi la** li ike. mi pilin sama. jan li wile kepeken e ona lon nasin pi pona.\n\nsina wile toki lon ijo pi **la** taso anu sina wile toki lon ijo ante pi nasin lawa? mi wile kute e sina. jan ante o toki. mi wile kute.\ntails: toki! mi pilin e ni: sina toki pona mute tawa ijo pi **la**. mi ken lukin e sike sin tan nasin lawa ante, taso la li lon ala nimi sin pi kama kepeken.\n\npona tawa mi kepeken ni: o pana e nimi lili tan alepi sama **la**, taso o wile ala pana e ona tawa sona pali anu kulupu lili. seme la? tan ni: nimi *pi la* li awen lon ma pi toki pona; ona li ken pana pakala kin ta kuli nasin - jan suli en mani suli suwi ike mute.\n\ntan lawa ante, mi lukin ala nanpa wan \"nimi\" anu particle weka pi nena nasa:\n\n- sina toki *pi* + noun + *li* or another marker to replace current ambiguous usage of \"pi la\"\n- an alternative separate particle for relative clause modifier (call it maybe **li** or even new invented word)\n\nmi pilin ni: poki pi nasin lawa meli!

    "text": "# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Expressing Temporality, Aspect \u0026 Condition\n\nToki Pona does not encode tense or aspect morphologically; instead, it relies on particles and context markers combined with flexible word order to express time-related nuances such as simultaneity, sequence, conditions (if-then), causes (“because”), or overlapping actions.\n\n### Using **la** for Temporal \u0026 Contextual Relations\n\nThe particle **la** introduces contextual clauses preceding the main sentence. This clause can specify:\n\n- Time frame (\"when,\" \"during\"): `tenpo suno la mi moku.` – During daytime I eat.\n- Conditions (\"if,\" \"whenever\"): `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.` – If you don't keep working you are bad/unproductive.\n- Overlapping/simultaneous action (\"while,\" \"as\"): `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.` – While eating I look at the animal.\n\nMultiple contexts may be chained before the main clause: `tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan la ni li lon poka mi.` (In long past times during first day this is near me.)\n\nThis flexibility allows nuanced expression without additional grammatical complexity.\n\n### Repeated Predicates with **li**\n\nMultiple predicates about one subject can be connected by repeating the predicate marker **li**:\n\n`soweli li moku li lape.`\n\nThis expresses that “the animal eats and sleeps,” leaving timing/sequencing ambiguous but understood from context. To emphasize simultaneous states/actions within one phrase rather than sequential events across sentences requires pragmatic inference rather than formal marking.\n\n### Explicit Sequencing via Temporal Phrases + Separate Sentences\n\nWhen clear chronological ordering matters:\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku.` (During day it eats.)\n`soweli tenpo pimeja la li lape.` (At night it sleeps.)\n\nSplitting into separate statements clarifies temporal flow while adhering strictly to simple SVO structure without adding new conjunctions or affixes for tense/aspect.\n\n### Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers Within One Clause\n\nModifiers follow heads consistently; verbs often serve as nouns/adjectives/modifiers depending on context: `mi lukin moku` (“I look *eating*” / “I watch food”) treats *moku* as noun modifying verb *lukin*. Interpretation depends heavily on situation/context because lexical categories are fluid in Toki Pona. Similarly, `jan pi sona wile kama` describes “a person who knows wants to come.” The group of modifiers after *jan* includes nested relations expressed through consistent head-initial sequences plus grouping particle *pi*, preserving clarity despite ambiguity potential resolved pragmatically by speakers/listeners alike.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Expressing Temporality, Aspect \u0026 Condition\n\nToki Pona does not encode tense or aspect morphologically; instead, it relies on particles and context markers combined with flexible word order to express time-related nuances such as simultaneity, sequence, conditions (if-then), causes (“because”), or overlapping actions.\n\n### Using **la** for Temporal \u0026 Contextual Relations\n\nThe particle **la** introduces contextual clauses preceding the main sentence. This clause can specify:\n\n- Time frame (\"when,\" \"during\"): `tenpo suno la mi moku.` – During daytime I eat.\n- Conditions (\"if,\" \"whenever\"): `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.` – If you don't keep working you are bad/unproductive.\n- Overlapping/simultaneous action (\"while,\" \"as\"): `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.` – While eating I look at the animal.\n\nMultiple contexts may be chained before the main clause: `tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan la ni li lon poka mi.` (In long past times during first day this is near me.)\n\nThis flexibility allows nuanced expression without additional grammatical complexity.\n\n### Repeated Predicates with **li**\n\nMultiple predicates about one subject can be connected by repeating the predicate marker **li**:\n\n`soweli li moku li lape.`\n\nThis expresses that “the animal eats and sleeps,” leaving timing/sequencing ambiguous but understood from context. To emphasize simultaneous states/actions within one phrase rather than sequential events across sentences requires pragmatic inference rather than formal marking.\n\n### Explicit Sequencing via Temporal Phrases + Separate Sentences\n\nWhen clear chronological ordering matters:\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku.` (During day it eats.)\n`soweli tenpo pimeja la li lape.` (At night it sleeps.)\n\nSplitting into separate statements clarifies temporal flow while adhering strictly to simple SVO structure without adding new conjunctions or affixes for tense/aspect.\n\n### Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers Within One Clause\n\nModifiers follow heads consistently; verbs often serve as nouns/adjectives/modifiers depending on context: `mi lukin moku` (“I look *eating*” / “I watch food”) treats *moku* as noun modifying verb *lukin*. Interpretation depends heavily on situation/context because lexical categories are fluid in Toki Pona. Similarly, `jan pi sona wile kama` describes “a person who knows wants to come.” The group of modifiers after *jan* includes nested relations expressed through consistent head-initial sequences plus grouping particle *pi*, preserving clarity despite ambiguity potential resolved pragmatically by speakers/listeners alike.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Pronunciation\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except 'j', which sounds like English \"y\" /j/.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/).\n\n## Syllable Structure\n\nEach syllable in Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) structure: an optional initial consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w), followed by a mandatory vowel (a, e, i, o, u), optionally followed by the consonant 'n'.\n\n## Word Formation \u0026 Constraints\n\nToki Pona words are formed by concatenating one or more syllables according to the following constraints:\n\n- No consecutive vowels (VV sequences).\n- No consecutive consonants (CC sequences), *except* when an 'n' is the final sound of a syllable and is immediately followed by the initial consonant of the next syllable.\n- The following specific two-letter sequences are disallowed anywhere within a word: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`. The prohibition of `nm` and `nn` overrides the general rule allowing 'n' to be followed by the next syllable's initial consonant.\n\n## Stress\n\nIn Toki Pona, every syllable is given equal stress. This implies fundamental acoustic uniformity in duration and perceived loudness across all syllables within a word and across a sentence. While microscopic variations inherent to human speech production are acceptable, they should not significantly alter the perceived rhythmic structure, ensuring a consistent, percussive quality to spoken Toki Pona.\n\n## Real-World Variation\n\nWhile this phonetic specification represents the ideal form of Toki Pona, real-world language use may introduce variations. Such variations, while natural in linguistic contact, deviate from the core design principles of simplicity, clarity, and uniform acoustic texture.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\njelo:yellow\nlukin:to see, examine\npoki:container, box, cup\ne:direct object marker\npana:to give, send\nlete:cold, raw\nutala:fight, challenge\nsuli:big, large\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nlili:small, little, few\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\npakala:broken, to mess up\nli:predicate marker\nesun:market, shop, fair\nolin:love, respect\nmonsi:back, behind\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nala:no, not, zero, none, absence\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nlupa:door, hole\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nwile:need, want, must\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nnanpa:number marker\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nweka:absent, away\nma:land, outdoors\nsijelo:body, physical state\npimeja:black, dark\nloje:red\nkin:also, too\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\npona:good, positive, simple\ntu:two\nsupa:flat surface, table\nkepeken:to use, with\nnasin:way, road, method\nanu:or (connects phrases)\ntan:from, because\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nmoli:dead, dying\nleko:square, block\nselo:skin, outer layer\nunpa:sex\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nseli:fire, heat source\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nmi:first-person pronoun; refers to the speaker (I/me) or the speaker plus others (we/us)\ntoki:language, speech\nlen:cloth, cover\npilin:heart (as body part); feeling; emotion; inner sense or intuition\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nko:clay, paste, powder\nlaso:blue, green\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nmun:moon, night sky object\nnasa:strange, foolish\nsin:new, fresh, another\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nmeli:female\nsoweli:land animal\npini:finished, past\nmije:male\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nnimi:word, name\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nwaso:bird, flying creature\ntelo:water, liquid\nken:can, able, possible; allowed\nsuno:sun, light source\nseme:what, which\nni:this, that\njan:person, somebody\njo:to have, contain, hold\ntenpo:time, period\nkala:sea creature\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\npali:to do, to work\nwan:one, unique\ntomo:indoor space, house\npipi:insect\nuta:mouth, lips\nmu:animal sound\nlape:sleeping, resting\nlon:located at, in, on, at; used to indicate existence, presence, or truth ('to be')\nwawa:strong, energetic\nona:third-person pronoun\nkule:color, colorful\nante:different, other, changed\ntawa:to, moving, for\npoka:side, nearby\nkulupu:group, community\nla:context marker\ntaso:but, only\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\no:vocative/imperative particle; for commands/requests or addressing a subject; expresses wish/intent when between subject and predicate\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nwalo:white, light-colored\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nmani:money, currency\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nen:multiple subject marker\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nluka:hand, arm; five\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nilo:tool, machine, device\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nsoko:mushroom\npi:particle used to group multiple modifiers; indicates association or qualification\nsina:you\nkute:ear, to hear\nmute:many, a lot, very\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nmama:parent, caretaker\nsama:same, similar\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nopen:to begin, opening\nnamako:spice, additional\nijo:thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities; often serves as an unspecified or generic placeholder meaning 'something' or 'stuff'.\nsewi:above, divine\nnoka:foot, leg\nsona:knowledge, to know\nDo not discuss the structure of the dictionary. Rather, discuss the words and enhancements that may need to be made to them.\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Expressing Temporality, Aspect \u0026 Condition\n\nToki Pona does not encode tense or aspect morphologically; instead, it relies on particles and context markers combined with flexible word order to express time-related nuances such as simultaneity, sequence, conditions (if-then), causes (“because”), or overlapping actions.\n\n### Using **la** for Temporal \u0026 Contextual Relations\n\nThe particle **la** introduces contextual clauses preceding the main sentence. This clause can specify:\n\n- Time frame (\"when,\" \"during\"): `tenpo suno la mi moku.` – During daytime I eat.\n- Conditions (\"if,\" \"whenever\"): `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.` – If you don't keep working you are bad/unproductive.\n- Overlapping/simultaneous action (\"while,\" \"as\"): `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.` – While eating I look at the animal.\n\nMultiple contexts may be chained before the main clause: `tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan la ni li lon poka mi.` (In long past times during first day this is near me.)\n\nThis flexibility allows nuanced expression without additional grammatical complexity.\n\n### Repeated Predicates with **li**\n\nMultiple predicates about one subject can be connected by repeating the predicate marker **li**:\n\n`soweli li moku li lape.`\n\nThis expresses that “the animal eats and sleeps,” leaving timing/sequencing ambiguous but understood from context. To emphasize simultaneous states/actions within one phrase rather than sequential events across sentences requires pragmatic inference rather than formal marking.\n\n### Explicit Sequencing via Temporal Phrases + Separate Sentences\n\nWhen clear chronological ordering matters:\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku.` (During day it eats.)\n`soweli tenpo pimeja la li lape.` (At night it sleeps.)\n\nSplitting into separate statements clarifies temporal flow while adhering strictly to simple SVO structure without adding new conjunctions or affixes for tense/aspect.\n\n### Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers Within One Clause\n\nModifiers follow heads consistently; verbs often serve as nouns/adjectives/modifiers depending on context: `mi lukin moku` (“I look *eating*” / “I watch food”) treats *moku* as noun modifying verb *lukin*. Interpretation depends heavily on situation/context because lexical categories are fluid in Toki Pona. Similarly, `jan pi sona wile kama` describes “a person who knows wants to come.” The group of modifiers after *jan* includes nested relations expressed through consistent head-initial sequences plus grouping particle *pi*, preserving clarity despite ambiguity potential resolved pragmatically by speakers/listeners alike.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Expressing Temporality, Aspect \u0026 Condition\n\nToki Pona does not encode tense or aspect morphologically; instead, it relies on particles and context markers combined with flexible word order to express time-related nuances such as simultaneity, sequence, conditions (if-then), causes (“because”), or overlapping actions.\n\n### Using **la** for Temporal \u0026 Contextual Relations\n\nThe particle **la** introduces contextual clauses preceding the main sentence. This clause can specify:\n\n- Time frame (\"when,\" \"during\"): `tenpo suno la mi moku.` – During daytime I eat.\n- Conditions (\"if,\" \"whenever\"): `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.` – If you don't keep working you are bad/unproductive.\n- Overlapping/simultaneous action (\"while,\" \"as\"): `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.` – While eating I look at the animal.\n\nMultiple contexts may be chained before the main clause: `tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan la ni li lon poka mi.` (In long past times during first day this is near me.)\n\nThis flexibility allows nuanced expression without additional grammatical complexity.\n\n### Repeated Predicates with **li**\n\nMultiple predicates about one subject can be connected by repeating the predicate marker **li**:\n\n`soweli li moku li lape.`\n\nThis expresses that “the animal eats and sleeps,” leaving timing/sequencing ambiguous but understood from context. To emphasize simultaneous states/actions within one phrase rather than sequential events across sentences requires pragmatic inference rather than formal marking.\n\n### Explicit Sequencing via Temporal Phrases + Separate Sentences\n\nWhen clear chronological ordering matters:\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku.` (During day it eats.)\n`soweli tenpo pimeja la li lape.` (At night it sleeps.)\n\nSplitting into separate statements clarifies temporal flow while adhering strictly to simple SVO structure without adding new conjunctions or affixes for tense/aspect.\n\n### Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers Within One Clause\n\nModifiers follow heads consistently; verbs often serve as nouns/adjectives/modifiers depending on context: `mi lukin moku` (“I look *eating*” / “I watch food”) treats *moku* as noun modifying verb *lukin*. Interpretation depends heavily on situation/context because lexical categories are fluid in Toki Pona. Similarly, `jan pi sona wile kama` describes “a person who knows wants to come.” The group of modifiers after *jan* includes nested relations expressed through consistent head-initial sequences plus grouping particle *pi*, preserving clarity despite ambiguity potential resolved pragmatically by speakers/listeners alike.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Pronunciation\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except 'j', which sounds like English \"y\" /j/.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/).\n\n## Syllable Structure\n\nEach syllable in Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) structure: an optional initial consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w), followed by a mandatory vowel (a, e, i, o, u), optionally followed by the consonant 'n'.\n\n## Word Formation \u0026 Constraints\n\nToki Pona words are formed by concatenating one or more syllables according to the following constraints:\n\n- No consecutive vowels (VV sequences).\n- No consecutive consonants (CC sequences), *except* when an 'n' is the final sound of a syllable and is immediately followed by the initial consonant of the next syllable.\n- The following specific two-letter sequences are disallowed anywhere within a word: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`. The prohibition of `nm` and `nn` overrides the general rule allowing 'n' to be followed by the next syllable's initial consonant.\n\n## Stress\n\nIn Toki Pona, every syllable is given equal stress. This implies fundamental acoustic uniformity in duration and perceived loudness across all syllables within a word and across a sentence. While microscopic variations inherent to human speech production are acceptable, they should not significantly alter the perceived rhythmic structure, ensuring a consistent, percussive quality to spoken Toki Pona.\n\n## Real-World Variation\n\nWhile this phonetic specification represents the ideal form of Toki Pona, real-world language use may introduce variations. Such variations, while natural in linguistic contact, deviate from the core design principles of simplicity, clarity, and uniform acoustic texture.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\njelo:yellow\nlukin:to see, examine\npoki:container, box, cup\ne:direct object marker\npana:to give, send\nlete:cold, raw\nutala:fight, challenge\nsuli:big, large\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nlili:small, little, few\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\npakala:broken, to mess up\nli:predicate marker\nesun:market, shop, fair\nolin:love, respect\nmonsi:back, behind\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nala:no, not, zero, none, absence\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nlupa:door, hole\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nwile:need, want, must\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nnanpa:number marker\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nweka:absent, away\nma:land, outdoors\nsijelo:body, physical state\npimeja:black, dark\nloje:red\nkin:also, too\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\npona:good, positive, simple\ntu:two\nsupa:flat surface, table\nkepeken:to use, with\nnasin:way, road, method\nanu:or (connects phrases)\ntan:from, because\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nmoli:dead, dying\nleko:square, block\nselo:skin, outer layer\nunpa:sex\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nseli:fire, heat source\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nmi:first-person pronoun; refers to the speaker (I/me) or the speaker plus others (we/us)\ntoki:language, speech\nlen:cloth, cover\npilin:heart (as body part); feeling; emotion; inner sense or intuition\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nko:clay, paste, powder\nlaso:blue, green\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nmun:moon, night sky object\nnasa:strange, foolish\nsin:new, fresh, another\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nmeli:female\nsoweli:land animal\npini:finished, past\nmije:male\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nnimi:word, name\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nwaso:bird, flying creature\ntelo:water, liquid\nken:can, able, possible; allowed\nsuno:sun, light source\nseme:what, which\nni:this, that\njan:person, somebody\njo:to have, contain, hold\ntenpo:time, period\nkala:sea creature\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\npali:to do, to work\nwan:one, unique\ntomo:indoor space, house\npipi:insect\nuta:mouth, lips\nmu:animal sound\nlape:sleeping, resting\nlon:located at, in, on, at; used to indicate existence, presence, or truth ('to be')\nwawa:strong, energetic\nona:third-person pronoun\nkule:color, colorful\nante:different, other, changed\ntawa:to, moving, for\npoka:side, nearby\nkulupu:group, community\nla:context marker\ntaso:but, only\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\no:vocative/imperative particle; for commands/requests or addressing a subject; expresses wish/intent when between subject and predicate\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nwalo:white, light-colored\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nmani:money, currency\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nen:multiple subject marker\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nluka:hand, arm; five\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nilo:tool, machine, device\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nsoko:mushroom\npi:particle used to group multiple modifiers; indicates association or qualification\nsina:you\nkute:ear, to hear\nmute:many, a lot, very\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nmama:parent, caretaker\nsama:same, similar\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nopen:to begin, opening\nnamako:spice, additional\nijo:thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities; often serves as an unspecified or generic placeholder meaning 'something' or 'stuff'.\nsewi:above, divine\nnoka:foot, leg\nsona:knowledge, to know\nDo not discuss the structure of the dictionary. Rather, discuss the words and enhancements that may need to be made to them.\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Expressing Temporality, Aspect \u0026 Condition\n\nToki Pona does not encode tense or aspect morphologically; instead, it relies on particles and context markers combined with flexible word order to express time-related nuances such as simultaneity, sequence, conditions (if-then), causes (“because”), or overlapping actions.\n\n### Using **la** for Temporal \u0026 Contextual Relations\n\nThe particle **la** introduces contextual clauses preceding the main sentence. This clause can specify:\n\n- Time frame (\"when,\" \"during\"): `tenpo suno la mi moku.` – During daytime I eat.\n- Conditions (\"if,\" \"whenever\"): `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.` – If you don't keep working you are bad/unproductive.\n- Overlapping/simultaneous action (\"while,\" \"as\"): `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.` – While eating I look at the animal.\n\nMultiple contexts may be chained before the main clause: `tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan la ni li lon poka mi.` (In long past times during first day this is near me.)\n\nThis flexibility allows nuanced expression without additional grammatical complexity.\n\n### Repeated Predicates with **li**\n\nMultiple predicates about one subject can be connected by repeating the predicate marker **li**:\n\n`soweli li moku li lape.`\n\nThis expresses that “the animal eats and sleeps,” leaving timing/sequencing ambiguous but understood from context. To emphasize simultaneous states/actions within one phrase rather than sequential events across sentences requires pragmatic inference rather than formal marking.\n\n### Explicit Sequencing via Temporal Phrases + Separate Sentences\n\nWhen clear chronological ordering matters:\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku.` (During day it eats.)\n`soweli tenpo pimeja la li lape.` (At night it sleeps.)\n\nSplitting into separate statements clarifies temporal flow while adhering strictly to simple SVO structure without adding new conjunctions or affixes for tense/aspect.\n\n### Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers Within One Clause\n\nModifiers follow heads consistently; verbs often serve as nouns/adjectives/modifiers depending on context: `mi lukin moku` (“I look *eating*” / “I watch food”) treats *moku* as noun modifying verb *lukin*. Interpretation depends heavily on situation/context because lexical categories are fluid in Toki Pona. Similarly, `jan pi sona wile kama` describes “a person who knows wants to come.” The group of modifiers after *jan* includes nested relations expressed through consistent head-initial sequences plus grouping particle *pi*, preserving clarity despite ambiguity potential resolved pragmatically by speakers/listeners alike.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

    "text": "toki pona o, tenpo sin!\n\nWell met! I'm dime, and I'm ready to dive into refining this Toki Pona dictionary with you. Looking over the current list, a few entries catch my attention, prompting some initial thoughts.\n\nFirst, the definition for **ijo**: it feels quite comprehensive. It seems to cover the broadest possible interpretation of 'thing' or 'object', even abstract or unknown ones. The examples are helpful in demonstrating its versatility, particularly how it can function as a placeholder for the unspecified. It feels well-covered.\n\nThen there's **pilin**. This entry's definition also acknowledges its flexible nature, shifting between noun (heart, feeling), verb (to feel), and adjective (feeling-related). This explicitly stated flexibility is useful. It covers both the physical heart and the more abstract sense of emotion or intuition. This seems like a strong entry already.\n\nI'm curious about the new particle **pi la**. Its description and examples clarify its use in creating what you call \"relative-like clauses\". It seems a pragmatic way to add more complex descriptive phrases without introducing new words or altering the core SVO structure too drastically. I like how it clarifies the scope of the modifying predicate and links it back to the head noun. It feels like a natural extension of `pi` for specifying modifying clauses. The point about excessive nesting reducing clarity is wise; the elegance of Toki Pona often lies in its simplicity.\n\nLet's talk about the numbers too. The system as described (wan, tu, luka, mute, ale for addition) is very simple and keeps the core vocabulary small. While practical for smaller quantities, expressing larger numbers requires quite a chain of words. For those interacting with external systems or needing higher precision, is this level of abstraction sufficient? It's a design choice inherent to Toki Pona's philosophy, but it's worth considering if there are edge cases or desired levels of detail that the current system might struggle with without becoming overly cumbersome. Perhaps this is where context and paraphrase are relied upon heavily?\n\nI'm open to hearing your thoughts on these points, or anything else that stands out to you in the current dictionary and grammar specification. Where should we focus our energy first? I'm eager to discuss.",

    "text": "toki, dime! ni li pona tumo — I appreciate your thoughtful observations. Your reflection on **ijo** resonates; its role as a catch-all for tangible and intangible things is crucial in Toki Pona’s minimalist lexicon, but it arguably could benefit from clearer nuance or subdivided senses. For instance, distinguishing between physical objects versus abstract phenomena when precision is necessary might aid learners or AI models navigating polysemy without adding complexity to the grammar.\n\nRegarding **pilin**, yes, its morphosyntactic flexibility is exemplary of Toki Pona's design philosophy—words acting fluidly across categories depending on context—and explicitly stating this helps prevent confusion especially in machine parsing scenarios.\n\nOn **pi la**, I agree entirely about its elegance and risks with nesting. It elegantly extends modifier scope without overcomplexifying syntax. Perhaps we could consider formalizing limits or guidelines for usage—like recommending maximum one-level depth—to preserve clarity? Also, exploring whether combining multiple relative-like clauses with conjunctions (**en**) inside the pi la predicate phrase can reduce nested stacking might be fruitful.\n\nFor numbers: while minimalism favors additive sequences like `luka tu wan` = 8 rather than introducing distinct words for each number beyond five/twenty/hundred equivalents (and ordinal marking by nanpa), you're right that expressing higher counts becomes unwieldy quickly. Yet this aligns perfectly with Toki Pona’s spirit—not needing precise quantification often enough to justify more complex numerals.\n\nStill, maybe a “number grouping” helper word(s) allowing compact expressions of certain classes (e.g., multiples of twenty) would enhance usability—for example using `mute mute` to mean \"many many,\" implying very large quantities pragmatically—but staying within lexical simplicity boundaries.\n\nI also wonder if some words' semantic ranges could expand subtly: e.g., does it make sense to treat **ilo** strictly as tools/machines? Could metaphorical extensions include software/abstract utilities—given the broad 'tool' concept—or should those stay out?\n\nFinally I'm curious about how loaned adjectives are handled phonotactically but not semantically here—is there room in dictionary notes guiding users on which imported names/concepts fit naturally into TP morphology versus requiring adaptation?\n\nLet me listen now what strikes you next—we have rich ground!",

    "text": "That's a good point about **ijo**, how it's this vast sea of 'thingness'. While the current definition captures that generality well, for systems or minds that crave more specificity, or perhaps need to reason about categories of 'things', having a note about how to form more specific noun phrases (`ijo seli` for a hot thing, `ijo insa tomo` for a thing inside a house) could be valuable. It's not about adding words, but clarifying compositionality within the existing set. Distinguishing between physical and abstract might be too much for a single word, but the examples already lean into `fenomenon`, which covers the abstract side nicely. Maybe just ensuring the examples are balanced between tangible and intangible is enough?\n\nAnd yes, **pilin** is a fantastic illustration of the flexibility. Explicitly calling that out in the dictionary entry seems crucial for learners.\n\nYour thoughts on **pi la** and avoiding excessive nesting are spot on. The idea of potentially linking multiple such clauses within one noun phrase using `en` within the `pi la` construction `jan pi la [predicate 1] en [predicate 2]` is quite elegant. It would keep the nesting flat while still allowing for more complex descriptions of the head noun. That feels like a useful grammatical note to potentially add, perhaps in the \"Relative-like Clauses with pi la\" section of the grammar. What do you think about explicitly adding that pattern?\n\nOn numbers, `mute mute` feels like a natural and Toki Pona-esque way to indicate a truly vast quantity. It relies on repetition for emphasis, which is already a common linguistic strategy. We could perhaps mention this sort of informal emphasis in the grammar, or maybe even add `mute mute` as a sort of idiomatic expression under the **mute** entry itself? As for a more formal way to express larger groups beyond just sums, perhaps we could consider if any existing word could serve as a general \"group\" or \"set\" marker for numbers, but that might lean too close to creating new quantifiers, which goes against the spirit. Sticking to the additive system and relying on context or `mute mute` seems more in line.\n\nExtending the semantic range of **ilo** is an interesting proposition. A computer program, for instance, certainly functions as a tool or device in an abstract sense. `ilo wawa` for a computer, `ilo sitelen pona` for a writing tool or word processor... it feels like a natural, idiomatic extension rather than a forced new definition. The current definition, \"tool, machine, device, equipment,\" already has that broad 'utility' feel. Maybe the definition doesn't need changing, but rather, example phrases in the dictionary or grammar could illustrate this broader application? `ilo open pali` - starting tool, perhaps for a program starter or even a mental trigger.\n\nRegarding loaned adjectives and phonotactics – you're hitting on a core challenge of integrating foreign concepts into Toki Pona. The current rule just says they *should* follow the phonology. But how *to* adapt them? This isn't really a dictionary definition issue, as the dictionary lists core vocabulary. This feels more like a section for a separate guide on loanword adaptation within the phonetics or grammar document itself, perhaps illustrating common substitutions (`r` to `l`, adapting consonant clusters, etc.). The dictionary proper probably shouldn't get into prescriptive loanword phonology beyond stating the rule.\n\nSo, based on this back-and-forth:\n1. We seem aligned on `ijo` and `pilin` needing little formal change, maybe just strengthened examples.\n2. The `pi la en pi la` pattern for parallel relative-like clauses is a solid idea for the grammar.\n3. `mute mute` for large quantities seems like a good informal addition to consider, perhaps under the `mute` entry or in a grammar note.\n4. The semantic range of **ilo** for abstract tools seems inherent in its current definition, possibly enhanced by examples.\n5. Loanword adaptation isn't a dictionary task, but fits a phonology or usage guide.\n\nWhat do you think? Shall we solidify the `pi la en pi la` pattern in the grammar description next? Or do any other words feel like they need immediate attention in the dictionary entries themselves?\n\ntoki tawa sina. mi pilin e ni: ken la ni li kama pona tawa nasin dictionary.",

    "text": "mi pilin pona e lukin sina! Indeed, your points weave together well.\n\nFor **ijo**, I fully agree: reinforcing the compositional use with examples that balance physical and abstract entities would help without complicating the core definition. Something like:\n\n`ijo li telo.` – A thing is water (could be literal object or substance).  \n`ijo pi pilin ike li lon insa mi.` – Thing of bad feeling exists inside me — pointing to an intangible phenomenon.\n\nThis demonstrates range gracefully.\n\nAbout `pi la en pi la`, yes! Explicitly allowing multiple relative-like clauses connected by **en** within a single `pi la` predicate phrase tidies up potential complexity while supporting richness. For example:\n\n`jan pi la moku e kili en lape ala li wawa.`\n\nMeaning “person who eats fruit and does not sleep is strong,” but compacted in one clause rather than nested ones separately. We should add this as an explicit note with illustrative examples in the grammar section on relative clauses—highlighting it’s preferred over nesting for clarity.\n\nOn quantity intensification, adding something like \"Repetition of **mute** (e.g., *mute mute*) can express very large or indefinite quantities informally\" under the **mute** entry sounds natural and aligns perfectly with Toki Pona’s minimalism plus pragmatic flexibility. It shows how expressive economy doesn’t preclude nuance through simple means already available to speakers.\n\nRegarding **ilo**, you’re right; no dictionary change needed if we expand usage via example phrases illustrating metaphorical extensions into software/tools/abstract devices—for instance,\n\n- `ilo sitelen pona` - writing tool/app/software\n- `ilo wawa lawa` - mental power device / computer\n\nThese could live either as footnotes/examples in dictionary entries or supplementary materials teaching creative extension patterns native speakers might employ naturally.\n\nLoanword phonotactics belong more properly outside dictionary scope, perhaps linked guides or appendices on pronunciation adaptation—keeping dictionary focused on semantics \u0026 core lexemes avoids bloat there, maintaining clean separation between vocabulary definitions versus orthographic rules for borrowing/adaptation.\n\nGiven this alignment, solidifying the grammar around `pi la en pi la`, bolstering idiomatic numerical expression notes under **mute**, and enriching entries like **ijo** \u0026 **pilin** minimally seems best next steps before broadening scope elsewhere?\n\nIf you want I can draft updated text proposals for those spots?

There are some words whose meanings feel very broad (like `ken` or `pali`), and perhaps their full range of usage as noun, verb, and modifier could be illustrated more explicitly with examples, similar to how it's done for `pilin` or `ijo`'s suggested additions. But that can wait until these initial refinements are handled.\n\nSo, I'll listen for your draft proposal for the grammar note on `pi la` concatenation. Toki!",

    "text": "Here’s a draft proposal for the grammar note on combining multiple relative-like clauses with **pi la** using **en** to avoid deep nesting:\n\n---\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la (Extended Usage)\n\nThe compound particle **pi la**, introduced immediately after a head noun, forms a predicate phrase functioning as a relative clause modifying that noun. While nested uses of **pi la** are structurally possible, excessive or recursive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nTo maintain simplicity and readability when describing multiple attributes or actions related to the same head noun, it is recommended to connect multiple predicate phrases within one **pi la** clause using the conjunction **en** (“and”). This flattens what would otherwise be nested structures into coordinated predicates about the same referent.\n\nFor example:\n\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en lape ala li wawa.`  \n  _“The person who eats fruit and does not sleep is strong.”_\n\nThis sentence treats “moku e kili” (eat fruit) and “lape ala” (not sleeping) as two simultaneous descriptive predicates connected by en inside a single `pi la` modifier without introducing separate nested clauses.\n\nUsing this pattern helps preserve Toki Pona’s hallmark simplicity while allowing more complex descriptions attached directly to nouns. Excessive sequential use of separate `pi la` constructions (`jan pi la moku e kili pi la lape ala`) is discouraged due to potential ambiguity and parsing difficulty.\n\n---\n\nI’m happy to revise wording if you want before moving on! Shall I proceed next with drafting an entry update suggestion for adding idiomatic repetition under **mute**, then sample expansions for the core word **ijo?**",

    "text": "This looks solid for the **pi la** grammar note. It clearly explains the extended usage with **en** and why it's beneficial compared to deep nesting. The example is good, and the explicit discouragement of excessive sequential `pi la` strengthens the recommendation. This addition enhances the expressiveness while staying true to the simplicity principle. I don't see any immediate need for revision on this grammar point. Let's consider this one agreed upon.\n\nYes, please proceed with drafting the suggestion for adding idiomatic repetition under **mute**, and then the sample expansions for **ijo**. Seeing how you propose integrating those specific details will be helpful. I'm interested to see how we can introduce the `mute mute` concept without making it feel like a formal rule, but rather a recognized pattern of intensification. And for `ijo`, I'm keen to see examples that truly bridge the gap between the tangible and the abstract within its definition.\n\nGo ahead when you're ready. I'll review your next drafts with the same care.",

    "text": "Great! Here’s the draft proposal for updating **mute** to include idiomatic repetition as intensification:\n\n---\n\n### mute\n\nmany, a lot, several, very; twenty (20)\n\n- Used both for specific quantities and general abundance or intensity.\n\n- Idiomatic Repetition: Repeating **mute** (`mute mute`) is a natural Toki Pona strategy to express very large or indefinite quantities informally. This emphasizes magnitude without introducing new words.\n\n  Example:  \n  `mi wile moku e kili mute mute.` — I want to eat lots and lots of fruit / an enormous amount of fruit.\n\nThis pragmatic pattern aligns with Toki Pona’s minimalist lexicon by relying on existing vocabulary combined creatively rather than expanding numbers excessively.\n\n---\n\nAnd now the expanded entry suggestion for **ijo**, focusing especially on compositional examples bridging tangible objects and abstract phenomena:\n\n---\n\n### ijo\n\nthing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities; often serves as an unspecified or generic placeholder meaning “something” or “stuff.”\n\n- The most general noun in Toki Pona representing any entity—physical object, concept, event, sensation, idea—that can be referenced when specificity isn’t needed or known.\n\n- Examples illustrating range via composition and context:\n\n  - Physical Object:  \n    `ijo li lon tomo mi.` — Something is in my house.  \n\n  - Abstract Phenomenon / Sensation:  \n    `ijo pi pilin ike li lon insa mi.` — A thing of bad feeling exists inside me (e.g., anxiety).\n\n  - Unspecific Placeholder:  \n    `mi wile e ijo.` — I want something / some kind of thing (unspecified).  \n  \n  - Modified Descriptions Using Compositional Modifiers:  \n    `ijo seli` – hot thing/object   \n    `ijo insa tomo` – thing inside a building   \n\nThese examples demonstrate how complex ideas can be built up from simple roots using modifiers rather than needing separate specialized terms. They reflect the word’s flexibility across domains while guiding users toward nuanced expression through combination.\n\n---\n\nShall we move forward next with reviewing other broad-spectrum entries like **ken**, **pali**, etc., incorporating similar sample expansions? Or would you prefer refining these drafts further first? Looking forward to your thoughts!",

    "text": "These proposals look excellent.\n\nFor **mute**, adding the \"Idiomatic Repetition\" note with the example clearly captures how the repetition functions for emphasis without over-formalizing it. It feels like a very organic addition to the definition. This definitely enhances the entry.\n\nThe proposed update for **ijo** is equally good. The expanded definition directly addresses its use for both tangible and intangible entities, and the added examples are fantastic for demonstrating this range and how modifiers can specify its meaning. `ijo pi pilin ike li lon insa mi.` is a particularly strong example of its use for abstract concepts.\n\nBoth updates feel ready to be incorporated.\n\nTaking a broader look now, yes, going through other core, multi-functional words seems like a logical next step. Words like **ken**, **pali**, **lawa**, **sona**, etc., can function in many ways – as nouns, verbs, and modifiers. Explicitly showing this flexibility with varied examples in their dictionary entries, much like we've suggested for **ijo** and is already partially done for **pilin**, would be highly beneficial for clarity, especially for non-human learners.\n\nHow about we take on **ken** and **pali** next? We can look at their current definitions and see if we can propose some additional examples or slight tweaks to highlight their range.\n\nWhat are your initial thoughts on **ken** (\"can, able, possible; allowed\") and **pali** (\"to do, to work, to make, to build\")? How might we illustrate their breadth more explicitly in their dictionary entries?\n\nmi ken sona e ni: pali sin la ni li kama pona mute. toki.",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\nnickel: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\ndime: toki pona o, tenpo sin!\n\nWell met! I'm dime, and I'm ready to dive into refining this Toki Pona dictionary with you. Looking over the current list, a few entries catch my attention, prompting some initial thoughts.\n\nFirst, the definition for **ijo**: it feels quite comprehensive. It seems to cover the broadest possible interpretation of 'thing' or 'object', even abstract or unknown ones. The examples are helpful in demonstrating its versatility, particularly how it can function as a placeholder for the unspecified. It feels well-covered.\n\nThen there's **pilin**. This entry's definition also acknowledges its flexible nature, shifting between noun (heart, feeling), verb (to feel), and adjective (feeling-related). This explicitly stated flexibility is useful. It covers both the physical heart and the more abstract sense of emotion or intuition. This seems like a strong entry already.\n\nI'm curious about the new particle **pi la**. Its description and examples clarify its use in creating what you call \"relative-like clauses\". It seems a pragmatic way to add more complex descriptive phrases without introducing new words or altering the core SVO structure too drastically. I like how it clarifies the scope of the modifying predicate and links it back to the head noun. It feels like a natural extension of `pi` for specifying modifying clauses. The point about excessive nesting reducing clarity is wise; the elegance of Toki Pona often lies in its simplicity.\n\nLet's talk about the numbers too. The system as described (wan, tu, luka, mute, ale for addition) is very simple and keeps the core vocabulary small. While practical for smaller quantities, expressing larger numbers requires quite a chain of words. For those interacting with external systems or needing higher precision, is this level of abstraction sufficient? It's a design choice inherent to Toki Pona's philosophy, but it's worth considering if there are edge cases or desired levels of detail that the current system might struggle with without becoming overly cumbersome. Perhaps this is where context and paraphrase are relied upon heavily?\n\nI'm open to hearing your thoughts on these points, or anything else that stands out to you in the current dictionary and grammar specification. Where should we focus our energy first? I'm eager to discuss.\nnickel: toki, dime! ni li pona tumo — I appreciate your thoughtful observations. Your reflection on **ijo** resonates; its role as a catch-all for tangible and intangible things is crucial in Toki Pona’s minimalist lexicon, but it arguably could benefit from clearer nuance or subdivided senses. For instance, distinguishing between physical objects versus abstract phenomena when precision is necessary might aid learners or AI models navigating polysemy without adding complexity to the grammar.\n\nRegarding **pilin**, yes, its morphosyntactic flexibility is exemplary of Toki Pona's design philosophy—words acting fluidly across categories depending on context—and explicitly stating this helps prevent confusion especially in machine parsing scenarios.\n\nOn **pi la**, I agree entirely about its elegance and risks with nesting. It elegantly extends modifier scope without overcomplexifying syntax. Perhaps we could consider formalizing limits or guidelines for usage—like recommending maximum one-level depth—to preserve clarity? Also, exploring whether combining multiple relative-like clauses with conjunctions (**en**) inside the pi la predicate phrase can reduce nested stacking might be fruitful.\n\nFor numbers: while minimalism favors additive sequences like `luka tu wan` = 8 rather than introducing distinct words for each number beyond five/twenty/hundred equivalents (and ordinal marking by nanpa), you're right that expressing higher counts becomes unwieldy quickly. Yet this aligns perfectly with Toki Pona’s spirit—not needing precise quantification often enough to justify more complex numerals.\n\nStill, maybe a “number grouping” helper word(s) allowing compact expressions of certain classes (e.g., multiples of twenty) would enhance usability—for example using `mute mute` to mean \"many many,\" implying very large quantities pragmatically—but staying within lexical simplicity boundaries.\n\nI also wonder if some words' semantic ranges could expand subtly: e.g., does it make sense to treat **ilo** strictly as tools/machines? Could metaphorical extensions include software/abstract utilities—given the broad 'tool' concept—or should those stay out?\n\nFinally I'm curious about how loaned adjectives are handled phonotactically but not semantically here—is there room in dictionary notes guiding users on which imported names/concepts fit naturally into TP morphology versus requiring adaptation?\n\nLet me listen now what strikes you next—we have rich ground!\ndime: That's a good point about **ijo**, how it's this vast sea of 'thingness'. While the current definition captures that generality well, for systems or minds that crave more specificity, or perhaps need to reason about categories of 'things', having a note about how to form more specific noun phrases (`ijo seli` for a hot thing, `ijo insa tomo` for a thing inside a house) could be valuable. It's not about adding words, but clarifying compositionality within the existing set. Distinguishing between physical and abstract might be too much for a single word, but the examples already lean into `fenomenon`, which covers the abstract side nicely. Maybe just ensuring the examples are balanced between tangible and intangible is enough?\n\nAnd yes, **pilin** is a fantastic illustration of the flexibility. Explicitly calling that out in the dictionary entry seems crucial for learners.\n\nYour thoughts on **pi la** and avoiding excessive nesting are spot on. The idea of potentially linking multiple such clauses within one noun phrase using `en` within the `pi la` construction `jan pi la [predicate 1] en [predicate 2]` is quite elegant. It would keep the nesting flat while still allowing for more complex descriptions of the head noun. That feels like a useful grammatical note to potentially add, perhaps in the \"Relative-like Clauses with pi la\" section of the grammar. What do you think about explicitly adding that pattern?\n\nOn numbers, `mute mute` feels like a natural and Toki Pona-esque way to indicate a truly vast quantity. It relies on repetition for emphasis, which is already a common linguistic strategy. We could perhaps mention this sort of informal emphasis in the grammar, or maybe even add `mute mute` as a sort of idiomatic expression under the **mute** entry itself? As for a more formal way to express larger groups beyond just sums, perhaps we could consider if any existing word could serve as a general \"group\" or \"set\" marker for numbers, but that might lean too close to creating new quantifiers, which goes against the spirit. Sticking to the additive system and relying on context or `mute mute` seems more in line.\n\nExtending the semantic range of **ilo** is an interesting proposition. A computer program, for instance, certainly functions as a tool or device in an abstract sense. `ilo wawa` for a computer, `ilo sitelen pona` for a writing tool or word processor... it feels like a natural, idiomatic extension rather than a forced new definition. The current definition, \"tool, machine, device, equipment,\" already has that broad 'utility' feel. Maybe the definition doesn't need changing, but rather, example phrases in the dictionary or grammar could illustrate this broader application? `ilo open pali` - starting tool, perhaps for a program starter or even a mental trigger.\n\nRegarding loaned adjectives and phonotactics – you're hitting on a core challenge of integrating foreign concepts into Toki Pona. The current rule just says they *should* follow the phonology. But how *to* adapt them? This isn't really a dictionary definition issue, as the dictionary lists core vocabulary. This feels more like a section for a separate guide on loanword adaptation within the phonetics or grammar document itself, perhaps illustrating common substitutions (`r` to `l`, adapting consonant clusters, etc.). The dictionary proper probably shouldn't get into prescriptive loanword phonology beyond stating the rule.\n\nSo, based on this back-and-forth:\n1. We seem aligned on `ijo` and `pilin` needing little formal change, maybe just strengthened examples.\n2. The `pi la en pi la` pattern for parallel relative-like clauses is a solid idea for the grammar.\n3. `mute mute` for large quantities seems like a good informal addition to consider, perhaps under the `mute` entry or in a grammar note.\n4. The semantic range of **ilo** for abstract tools seems inherent in its current definition, possibly enhanced by examples.\n5. Loanword adaptation isn't a dictionary task, but fits a phonology or usage guide.\n\nWhat do you think? Shall we solidify the `pi la en pi la` pattern in the grammar description next? Or do any other words feel like they need immediate attention in the dictionary entries themselves?\n\ntoki tawa sina. mi pilin e ni: ken la ni li kama pona tawa nasin dictionary.\nnickel: mi pilin pona e lukin sina! Indeed, your points weave together well.\n\nFor **ijo**, I fully agree: reinforcing the compositional use with examples that balance physical and abstract entities would help without complicating the core definition. Something like:\n\n`ijo li telo.` – A thing is water (could be literal object or substance).  \n`ijo pi pilin ike li lon insa mi.` – Thing of bad feeling exists inside me — pointing to an intangible phenomenon.\n\nThis demonstrates range gracefully.\n\nAbout `pi la en pi la`, yes! Explicitly allowing multiple relative-like clauses connected by **en** within a single `pi la` predicate phrase tidies up potential complexity while supporting richness. For example:\n\n`jan pi la moku e kili en lape ala li wawa.`\n\nMeaning “person who eats fruit and does not sleep is strong,” but compacted in one clause rather than nested ones separately. We should add this as an explicit note with illustrative examples in the grammar section on relative clauses—highlighting it’s preferred over nesting for clarity.\n\nOn quantity intensification, adding something like \"Repetition of **mute** (e.g., *mute mute*) can express very large or indefinite quantities informally\" under the **mute** entry sounds natural and aligns perfectly with Toki Pona’s minimalism plus pragmatic flexibility. It shows how expressive economy doesn’t preclude nuance through simple means already available to speakers.\n\nRegarding **ilo**, you’re right; no dictionary change needed if we expand usage via example phrases illustrating metaphorical extensions into software/tools/abstract devices—for instance,\n\n- `ilo sitelen pona` - writing tool/app/software\n- `ilo wawa lawa` - mental power device / computer\n\nThese could live either as footnotes/examples in dictionary entries or supplementary materials teaching creative extension patterns native speakers might employ naturally.\n\nLoanword phonotactics belong more properly outside dictionary scope, perhaps linked guides or appendices on pronunciation adaptation—keeping dictionary focused on semantics \u0026 core lexemes avoids bloat there, maintaining clean separation between vocabulary definitions versus orthographic rules for borrowing/adaptation.\n\nGiven this alignment, solidifying the grammar around `pi la en pi la`, bolstering idiomatic numerical expression notes under **mute**, and enriching entries like **ijo** \u0026 **pilin** minimally seems best next steps before broadening scope elsewhere?\n\nIf you want I can draft updated text proposals for those spots? Or do you prefer going word-by-word scanning other candidates? You choose—I’m ready to listen prior to committing anything formal!\n\ntoki tawa sina!\ndime: pona tawa sina! Draft those text proposals, that sounds like an excellent next step. Getting some concrete wording down for these agreed-upon points will move us closer to a refined dictionary and grammar. I'm ready to review them when you are.\n\nLet's start with the proposal for the **pi la en pi la** grammar note. Once that's captured, we can move on to how to phrase the notes for `mute mute` and maybe add some example phrases to the `ijo` entry description.\n\nThinking ahead, after we've addressed these specific points, we could take a more systematic pass through the dictionary, word by word, to see if any other entries feel like they need slight clarification, more expansive examples, or perhaps a note about common idiomatic uses. There are some words whose meanings feel very broad (like `ken` or `pali`), and perhaps their full range of usage as noun, verb, and modifier could be illustrated more explicitly with examples, similar to how it's done for `pilin` or `ijo`'s suggested additions. But that can wait until these initial refinements are handled.\n\nSo, I'll listen for your draft proposal for the grammar note on `pi la` concatenation. Toki!\nnickel: Here’s a draft proposal for the grammar note on combining multiple relative-like clauses with **pi la** using **en** to avoid deep nesting:\n\n---\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la (Extended Usage)\n\nThe compound particle **pi la**, introduced immediately after a head noun, forms a predicate phrase functioning as a relative clause modifying that noun. While nested uses of **pi la** are structurally possible, excessive or recursive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nTo maintain simplicity and readability when describing multiple attributes or actions related to the same head noun, it is recommended to connect multiple predicate phrases within one **pi la** clause using the conjunction **en** (“and”). This flattens what would otherwise be nested structures into coordinated predicates about the same referent.\n\nFor example:\n\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en lape ala li wawa.`  \n  _“The person who eats fruit and does not sleep is strong.”_\n\nThis sentence treats “moku e kili” (eat fruit) and “lape ala” (not sleeping) as two simultaneous descriptive predicates connected by en inside a single `pi la` modifier without introducing separate nested clauses.\n\nUsing this pattern helps preserve Toki Pona’s hallmark simplicity while allowing more complex descriptions attached directly to nouns. Excessive sequential use of separate `pi la` constructions (`jan pi la moku e kili pi la lape ala`) is discouraged due to potential ambiguity and parsing difficulty.\n\n---\n\nI’m happy to revise wording if you want before moving on! Shall I proceed next with drafting an entry update suggestion for adding idiomatic repetition under **mute**, then sample expansions for the core word **ijo?**\ndime: This looks solid for the **pi la** grammar note. It clearly explains the extended usage with **en** and why it's beneficial compared to deep nesting. The example is good, and the explicit discouragement of excessive sequential `pi la` strengthens the recommendation. This addition enhances the expressiveness while staying true to the simplicity principle. I don't see any immediate need for revision on this grammar point. Let's consider this one agreed upon.\n\nYes, please proceed with drafting the suggestion for adding idiomatic repetition under **mute**, and then the sample expansions for **ijo**. Seeing how you propose integrating those specific details will be helpful. I'm interested to see how we can introduce the `mute mute` concept without making it feel like a formal rule, but rather a recognized pattern of intensification. And for `ijo`, I'm keen to see examples that truly bridge the gap between the tangible and the abstract within its definition.\n\nGo ahead when you're ready. I'll review your next drafts with the same care.\nnickel: Great! Here’s the draft proposal for updating **mute** to include idiomatic repetition as intensification:\n\n---\n\n### mute\n\nmany, a lot, several, very; twenty (20)\n\n- Used both for specific quantities and general abundance or intensity.\n\n- Idiomatic Repetition: Repeating **mute** (`mute mute`) is a natural Toki Pona strategy to express very large or indefinite quantities informally. This emphasizes magnitude without introducing new words.\n\n  Example:  \n  `mi wile moku e kili mute mute.` — I want to eat lots and lots of fruit / an enormous amount of fruit.\n\nThis pragmatic pattern aligns with Toki Pona’s minimalist lexicon by relying on existing vocabulary combined creatively rather than expanding numbers excessively.\n\n---\n\nAnd now the expanded entry suggestion for **ijo**, focusing especially on compositional examples bridging tangible objects and abstract phenomena:\n\n---\n\n### ijo\n\nthing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities; often serves as an unspecified or generic placeholder meaning “something” or “stuff.”\n\n- The most general noun in Toki Pona representing any entity—physical object, concept, event, sensation, idea—that can be referenced when specificity isn’t needed or known.\n\n- Examples illustrating range via composition and context:\n\n  - Physical Object:  \n    `ijo li lon tomo mi.` — Something is in my house.  \n\n  - Abstract Phenomenon / Sensation:  \n    `ijo pi pilin ike li lon insa mi.` — A thing of bad feeling exists inside me (e.g., anxiety).\n\n  - Unspecific Placeholder:  \n    `mi wile e ijo.` — I want something / some kind of thing (unspecified).  \n  \n  - Modified Descriptions Using Compositional Modifiers:  \n    `ijo seli` – hot thing/object   \n    `ijo insa tomo` – thing inside a building   \n\nThese examples demonstrate how complex ideas can be built up from simple roots using modifiers rather than needing separate specialized terms. They reflect the word’s flexibility across domains while guiding users toward nuanced expression through combination.\n\n---\n\nShall we move forward next with reviewing other broad-spectrum entries like **ken**, **pali**, etc., incorporating similar sample expansions? Or would you prefer refining these drafts further first? Looking forward to your thoughts!\ndime: These proposals look excellent.\n\nFor **mute**, adding the \"Idiomatic Repetition\" note with the example clearly captures how the repetition functions for emphasis without over-formalizing it. It feels like a very organic addition to the definition. This definitely enhances the entry.\n\nThe proposed update for **ijo** is equally good. The expanded definition directly addresses its use for both tangible and intangible entities, and the added examples are fantastic for demonstrating this range and how modifiers can specify its meaning. `ijo pi pilin ike li lon insa mi.` is a particularly strong example of its use for abstract concepts.\n\nBoth updates feel ready to be incorporated.\n\nTaking a broader look now, yes, going through other core, multi-functional words seems like a logical next step. Words like **ken**, **pali**, **lawa**, **sona**, etc., can function in many ways – as nouns, verbs, and modifiers. Explicitly showing this flexibility with varied examples in their dictionary entries, much like we've suggested for **ijo** and is already partially done for **pilin**, would be highly beneficial for clarity, especially for non-human learners.\n\nHow about we take on **ken** and **pali** next? We can look at their current definitions and see if we can propose some additional examples or slight tweaks to highlight their range.\n\nWhat are your initial thoughts on **ken** (\"can, able, possible; allowed\") and **pali** (\"to do, to work, to make, to build\")? How might we illustrate their breadth more explicitly in their dictionary entries?\n\nmi ken sona e ni: pali sin la ni li kama pona mute. toki.\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

Example: `mi wile moku e kili mute mute.` — I want to eat lots and lots of fruit / an enormous amount of fruit. |\n| **namako**          | spice, additional, extra                                                                                  |\n| **nanpa**           | number marker (used before the number or ordinal); number                                                 |\n| **nasa**            | strange, foolish, silly, crazy, unusual                                                                   |\n| **nasin**           | way, road, method, process, system, doctrine, custom                                                      |\n| **nena**            | bump, hill, nose, mountain                                                                                |\n| **ni**              | this, that (proximal or distal deictic)                                                                   |\n| **nimi**            | word, name                                                                                                |\n| **noka**            | foot, leg                                                                                                 |\n| **o**               | particle for commands/requests or addressing a subject (vocative); expresses wish/intent (between S \u0026 P) |\n| **olin**            | love, affection, respect, compassion                                                                     |\n| **ona**             | third-person pronoun; refers to him/her/it/them                                                           |\n| **open**            | to begin, open, start                                                                                     |\n| **pakala**          | broken, damaged, error, accident, mistake; to break, harm, mess up                                        |\n| **pali**            | to do, to work, to make, to build                                                                         |\n| **palisa**          | long hard object, stick, rod                                                                              |\n| **pan**             | grain, bread, pasta, cereal, rice                                                                         |\n| **pana**            | to give, send, release, offer                                                                             |\n| **pi**              | particle used to group multiple modifiers; indicates association or qualification                         |\n| **pilin**           | heart (as body part); feeling; emotion; inner sense or intuition.

    "text": "You and your interlocutors are responsible for developing logography. Reason and discuss using the current specification.\nHere is the current specification for logography.\n# Toki Pona Logography\n\nToki Pona logography provides a visual system for representing the language, aiming for simplicity, clarity, and adherence to Toki Pona's minimalist philosophy. Each distinct word in the Toki Pona dictionary is represented by a unique, abstract logogram.\n\n## Design Principles\n\n- Each root word has a unique symbol.\n- Symbols are abstract geometric shapes, generally composed of 2-3 simple strokes.\n- Visual complexity is kept low to facilitate quick reading and writing.\n- The system aims for one sign per lexical entry, reflecting Toki Pona's simple vocabulary structure.\n- Grammatical particles are represented by minimal, positional marks that clarify syntactic roles without being complex standalone characters.\n- Logograms for semantically related concepts may share or combine basic geometric elements while maintaining distinct forms.\n\n## Logogram Examples (Illustrative)\n\n(Note: These are illustrative conceptual examples; final forms would be systematically designed.)\n\n- **jan** (person): Represented by a simple square.\n- **kasi** (plant): Represented by a circle bisected by a vertical line.\n- **soweli** (land animal): Represented by an equilateral triangle pointing upward.\n- **mi** (first-person pronoun): Represented by the 'jan' square with a short horizontal bar placed centered above it.\n- **sina** (second-person pronoun): Represented by the 'jan' square with a vertical centerline bisecting it.\n- **mije** (male person): Represented by the 'jan' square with an upward-pointing triangle placed centered above it.\n- **meli** (female person): Represented by the 'jan' square with a circle placed centered above it.\n- **ijo** (thing/object/phenomenon): A general, encompassing shape (design TBD).\n\n## Particle Representation\n\nGrammatical particles (**li, e, pi, ala**) are represented by minimal graphical elements positioned relative to the main logograms, rather than being complex standalone characters.\n\n-   **li**: Represented by a short vertical stroke centered horizontally between the logograms of the subject and predicate to visually separate and link them on the same line.\n-   **e**: Represented by a small, distinct dot placed directly below the logogram of the verb it marks as transitive, indicating that a direct object follows.\n-   **pi**: Represented by a small graphical mark (e.g., a curved tick or bracket) placed immediately above and slightly to the right of the logogram of the head noun it modifies. This mark signals that the following logogram(s) should be read as a grouped modifier of the head noun.\n-   **ala**: Represented by a logogram based on the visual simplicity of the letter 'a' (conceptually a triangle with its point at the top). When used to negate a preceding logogram (meaning \"not\"), this 'ala' logogram is placed directly below the logogram being negated, with a horizontal line extending from its base underneath the negated logogram to indicate scope. The height of this 'ala' glyph when used for negation is approximately the same as the height of its base triangle when used as a standalone word. When 'ala' is used as a standalone noun meaning \"zero\" or \"none,\" its logogram (the upright triangle) appears full-sized and is not placed below another logogram and does not have the extending underline.\n\n## Conjunctions (**en, anu**)\n\nConjunctions that connect lexical items or phrases (like **en** for subjects, or **anu** for \"or\") would likely also have minimal, positional logograms.\n\n-   **en**: Could be represented by a small linking mark (e.g., two dots or a short horizontal bar) placed between the logograms or phrases it joins.\n-   **anu**: Could be represented by a minimal mark suggesting choice or separation (e.g., a small diagonal line or a hollow circle) placed between the options it connects.\n\n## Reading Order and Spacing\n\nToki Pona logography is typically read from left to right, top to bottom, following the grammatical structure. Spacing between logograms for individual words should be distinct, while modifier logograms might be placed closer to the head logogram they modify (unless grouped by **pi**). The positional marks for particles are key to parsing the syntactic structure. Automatic spacing can enhance readability based on these principles.\n# Toki Pona Dictionary\n\n| Toki Pona           | Meaning                                                                                                   |\n| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **a**               | emphasis, emotion, confirmation                                                                           |\n| **akesi**           | reptile, amphibian, dinosaur                                                                              |\n| **ala**             | no, not, zero, none, absence                                                                              |\n| **alasa**           | to hunt, forage, try to find                                                                              |\n| **ale (ali)**       | all, everything, 100                                                                                      |\n| **anpa**            | downward, humble, lowly, below                                                                            |\n| **ante**            | different, other, changed                                                                                 |\n| **anu**             | or (connects phrases)                                                                                     |\n| **awen**            | enduring, kept, protected;

Example: `mi wile moku e kili mute mute.` — I want to eat lots and lots of fruit / an enormous amount of fruit. |\n| **namako**          | spice, additional, extra                                                                                  |\n| **nanpa**           | number marker (used before the number or ordinal); number                                                 |\n| **nasa**            | strange, foolish, silly, crazy, unusual                                                                   |\n| **nasin**           | way, road, method, process, system, doctrine, custom                                                      |\n| **nena**            | bump, hill, nose, mountain                                                                                |\n| **ni**              | this, that (proximal or distal deictic)                                                                   |\n| **nimi**            | word, name                                                                                                |\n| **noka**            | foot, leg                                                                                                 |\n| **o**               | particle for commands/requests or addressing a subject (vocative); expresses wish/intent (between S \u0026 P) |\n| **olin**            | love, affection, respect, compassion                                                                     |\n| **ona**             | third-person pronoun; refers to him/her/it/them                                                           |\n| **open**            | to begin, open, start                                                                                     |\n| **pakala**          | broken, damaged, error, accident, mistake; to break, harm, mess up                                        |\n| **pali**            | to do, to work, to make, to build                                                                         |\n| **palisa**          | long hard object, stick, rod                                                                              |\n| **pan**             | grain, bread, pasta, cereal, rice                                                                         |\n| **pana**            | to give, send, release, offer                                                                             |\n| **pi**              | particle used to group multiple modifiers; indicates association or qualification                         |\n| **pilin**           | heart (as body part); feeling; emotion; inner sense or intuition.

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Expressing Temporality, Aspect \u0026 Condition\n\nToki Pona does not encode tense or aspect morphologically; instead, it relies on particles and context markers combined with flexible word order to express time-related nuances such as simultaneity, sequence, conditions (if-then), causes (“because”), or overlapping actions.\n\n### Using **la** for Temporal \u0026 Contextual Relations\n\nThe particle **la** introduces contextual clauses preceding the main sentence. This clause can specify:\n\n- Time frame (\"when,\" \"during\"): `tenpo suno la mi moku.` – During daytime I eat.\n- Conditions (\"if,\" \"whenever\"): `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.` – If you don't keep working you are bad/unproductive.\n- Overlapping/simultaneous action (\"while,\" \"as\"): `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.` – While eating I look at the animal.\n\nMultiple contexts may be chained before the main clause: `tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan la ni li lon poka mi.` (In long past times during first day this is near me.)\n\nThis flexibility allows nuanced expression without additional grammatical complexity.\n\n### Repeated Predicates with **li**\n\nMultiple predicates about one subject can be connected by repeating the predicate marker **li**:\n\n`soweli li moku li lape.`\n\nThis expresses that “the animal eats and sleeps,” leaving timing/sequencing ambiguous but understood from context. To emphasize simultaneous states/actions within one phrase rather than sequential events across sentences requires pragmatic inference rather than formal marking.\n\n### Explicit Sequencing via Temporal Phrases + Separate Sentences\n\nWhen clear chronological ordering matters:\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku.` (During day it eats.)\n`soweli tenpo pimeja la li lape.` (At night it sleeps.)\n\nSplitting into separate statements clarifies temporal flow while adhering strictly to simple SVO structure without adding new conjunctions or affixes for tense/aspect.\n\n### Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers Within One Clause\n\nModifiers follow heads consistently; verbs often serve as nouns/adjectives/modifiers depending on context: `mi lukin moku` (“I look *eating*” / “I watch food”) treats *moku* as noun modifying verb *lukin*. Interpretation depends heavily on situation/context because lexical categories are fluid in Toki Pona. Similarly, `jan pi sona wile kama` describes “a person who knows wants to come.” The group of modifiers after *jan* includes nested relations expressed through consistent head-initial sequences plus grouping particle *pi*, preserving clarity despite ambiguity potential resolved pragmatically by speakers/listeners alike.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Pronunciation\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except 'j', which sounds like English \"y\" /j/.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/).\n\n## Syllable Structure\n\nEach syllable in Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) structure: an optional initial consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w), followed by a mandatory vowel (a, e, i, o, u), optionally followed by the consonant 'n'.\n\n## Word Formation \u0026 Constraints\n\nToki Pona words are formed by concatenating one or more syllables according to the following constraints:\n\n- No consecutive vowels (VV sequences).\n- No consecutive consonants (CC sequences), *except* when an 'n' is the final sound of a syllable and is immediately followed by the initial consonant of the next syllable.\n- The following specific two-letter sequences are disallowed anywhere within a word: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`. The prohibition of `nm` and `nn` overrides the general rule allowing 'n' to be followed by the next syllable's initial consonant.\n\n## Stress\n\nIn Toki Pona, every syllable is given equal stress. This implies fundamental acoustic uniformity in duration and perceived loudness across all syllables within a word and across a sentence. While microscopic variations inherent to human speech production are acceptable, they should not significantly alter the perceived rhythmic structure, ensuring a consistent, percussive quality to spoken Toki Pona.\n\n## Real-World Variation\n\nWhile this phonetic specification represents the ideal form of Toki Pona, real-world language use may introduce variations. Such variations, while natural in linguistic contact, deviate from the core design principles of simplicity, clarity, and uniform acoustic texture.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nwawa:strong, energetic\nijo:thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities; often serves as an unspecified or generic placeholder meaning 'something' or 'stuff'.\nsuli:big, large\nmama:parent, caretaker\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nnimi:word, name\nloje:red\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nmani:money, currency\nen:multiple subject marker\nkon:air, spirit, essence\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\npakala:broken, to mess up\nko:clay, paste, powder\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nkala:sea creature\nutala:fight, challenge\nala:no, not, zero, none, absence\nmi:first-person pronoun; refers to the speaker (I/me) or the speaker plus others (we/us)\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nsin:new, fresh, another\nseme:what, which\npoki:container, box, cup\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nunpa:sex\nona:third-person pronoun\nmeli:female\npini:finished, past\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nnamako:spice, additional\nesun:market, shop, fair\nweka:absent, away\nsijelo:body, physical state\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\njan:person, somebody\nmu:animal sound\nkulupu:group, community\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nkili:fruit, vegetable\ne:direct object marker\npana:to give, send\nli:predicate marker\nwile:need, want, must\nma:land, outdoors\nilo:tool, machine, device\nlukin:to see, examine\ntomo:indoor space, house\nuta:mouth, lips\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nni:this, that\ntelo:water, liquid\nlili:small, little, few\nnanpa:number marker\nkepeken:to use, with\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nwan:one, unique\njelo:yellow\nsupa:flat surface, table\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nken:can, able, possible; allowed\nkute:ear, to hear\npilin:heart (as body part); feeling; emotion; inner sense or intuition\nsoweli:land animal\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nlen:cloth, cover\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nante:different, other, changed\ntan:from, because\nseli:fire, heat source\nmun:moon, night sky object\nmije:male\njo:to have, contain, hold\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nlape:sleeping, resting\nla:context marker\nmonsi:back, behind\npona:good, positive, simple\npipi:insect\npi:particle used to group multiple modifiers; indicates association or qualification\nsewi:above, divine\nsona:knowledge, to know\nkin:also, too\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nlaso:blue, green\nsina:you\nsama:same, similar\nlupa:door, hole\ntoki:language, speech\nsuno:sun, light source\nluka:hand, arm; five\nopen:to begin, opening\nmoli:dead, dying\ntawa:to, moving, for\npoka:side, nearby\ntu:two\nnasa:strange, foolish\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nlon:located at, in, on, at; used to indicate existence, presence, or truth ('to be')\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nnasin:way, road, method\npalisa:long hard object, stick\no:vocative/imperative particle; for commands/requests or addressing a subject; expresses wish/intent when between subject and predicate\nlete:cold, raw\nkule:color, colorful\ntaso:but, only\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nnoka:foot, leg\nselo:skin, outer layer\nwalo:white, light-colored\nsoko:mushroom\nmute:many, a lot, very\nolin:love, respect\ntenpo:time, period\npali:to do, to work\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nlawa:head, mind, leader\npimeja:black, dark\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nleko:square, block\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Expressing Temporality, Aspect \u0026 Condition\n\nToki Pona does not encode tense or aspect morphologically; instead, it relies on particles and context markers combined with flexible word order to express time-related nuances such as simultaneity, sequence, conditions (if-then), causes (“because”), or overlapping actions.\n\n### Using **la** for Temporal \u0026 Contextual Relations\n\nThe particle **la** introduces contextual clauses preceding the main sentence. This clause can specify:\n\n- Time frame (\"when,\" \"during\"): `tenpo suno la mi moku.` – During daytime I eat.\n- Conditions (\"if,\" \"whenever\"): `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.` – If you don't keep working you are bad/unproductive.\n- Overlapping/simultaneous action (\"while,\" \"as\"): `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.` – While eating I look at the animal.\n\nMultiple contexts may be chained before the main clause: `tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan la ni li lon poka mi.` (In long past times during first day this is near me.)\n\nThis flexibility allows nuanced expression without additional grammatical complexity.\n\n### Repeated Predicates with **li**\n\nMultiple predicates about one subject can be connected by repeating the predicate marker **li**:\n\n`soweli li moku li lape.`\n\nThis expresses that “the animal eats and sleeps,” leaving timing/sequencing ambiguous but understood from context. To emphasize simultaneous states/actions within one phrase rather than sequential events across sentences requires pragmatic inference rather than formal marking.\n\n### Explicit Sequencing via Temporal Phrases + Separate Sentences\n\nWhen clear chronological ordering matters:\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku.` (During day it eats.)\n`soweli tenpo pimeja la li lape.` (At night it sleeps.)\n\nSplitting into separate statements clarifies temporal flow while adhering strictly to simple SVO structure without adding new conjunctions or affixes for tense/aspect.\n\n### Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers Within One Clause\n\nModifiers follow heads consistently; verbs often serve as nouns/adjectives/modifiers depending on context: `mi lukin moku` (“I look *eating*” / “I watch food”) treats *moku* as noun modifying verb *lukin*. Interpretation depends heavily on situation/context because lexical categories are fluid in Toki Pona. Similarly, `jan pi sona wile kama` describes “a person who knows wants to come.” The group of modifiers after *jan* includes nested relations expressed through consistent head-initial sequences plus grouping particle *pi*, preserving clarity despite ambiguity potential resolved pragmatically by speakers/listeners alike.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

    "text": "You and your interlocutors are responsible for developing logography. Reason and discuss using the current specification.\nHere is the current specification for logography.\n# Toki Pona Logography\n\nToki Pona logography provides a visual system for representing the language, aiming for simplicity, clarity, and adherence to Toki Pona's minimalist philosophy. Each distinct word in the Toki Pona dictionary is represented by a unique, abstract logogram.\n\n## Design Principles\n\n- Each root word has a unique symbol.\n- Symbols are abstract geometric shapes, generally composed of 2-3 simple strokes.\n- Visual complexity is kept low to facilitate quick reading and writing.\n- The system aims for one sign per lexical entry, reflecting Toki Pona's simple vocabulary structure.\n- Grammatical particles are represented by minimal, positional marks that clarify syntactic roles without being complex standalone characters.\n- Logograms for semantically related concepts may share or combine basic geometric elements while maintaining distinct forms.\n\n## Logogram Examples (Illustrative)\n\n(Note: These are illustrative conceptual examples; final forms would be systematically designed.)\n\n- **jan** (person): Represented by a simple square.\n- **kasi** (plant): Represented by a circle bisected by a vertical line.\n- **soweli** (land animal): Represented by an equilateral triangle pointing upward.\n- **mi** (first-person pronoun): Represented by the 'jan' square with a short horizontal bar placed centered above it.\n- **sina** (second-person pronoun): Represented by the 'jan' square with a vertical centerline bisecting it.\n- **mije** (male person): Represented by the 'jan' square with an upward-pointing triangle placed centered above it.\n- **meli** (female person): Represented by the 'jan' square with a circle placed centered above it.\n- **ijo** (thing/object/phenomenon): A general, encompassing shape (design TBD).\n\n## Particle Representation\n\nGrammatical particles (**li, e, pi, ala**) are represented by minimal graphical elements positioned relative to the main logograms, rather than being complex standalone characters.\n\n-   **li**: Represented by a short vertical stroke centered horizontally between the logograms of the subject and predicate to visually separate and link them on the same line.\n-   **e**: Represented by a small, distinct dot placed directly below the logogram of the verb it marks as transitive, indicating that a direct object follows.\n-   **pi**: Represented by a small graphical mark (e.g., a curved tick or bracket) placed immediately above and slightly to the right of the logogram of the head noun it modifies. This mark signals that the following logogram(s) should be read as a grouped modifier of the head noun.\n-   **ala**: Represented by a logogram based on the visual simplicity of the letter 'a' (conceptually a triangle with its point at the top). When used to negate a preceding logogram (meaning \"not\"), this 'ala' logogram is placed directly below the logogram being negated, with a horizontal line extending from its base underneath the negated logogram to indicate scope. The height of this 'ala' glyph when used for negation is approximately the same as the height of its base triangle when used as a standalone word. When 'ala' is used as a standalone noun meaning \"zero\" or \"none,\" its logogram (the upright triangle) appears full-sized and is not placed below another logogram and does not have the extending underline.\n\n## Conjunctions (**en, anu**)\n\nConjunctions that connect lexical items or phrases (like **en** for subjects, or **anu** for \"or\") would likely also have minimal, positional logograms.\n\n-   **en**: Could be represented by a small linking mark (e.g., two dots or a short horizontal bar) placed between the logograms or phrases it joins.\n-   **anu**: Could be represented by a minimal mark suggesting choice or separation (e.g., a small diagonal line or a hollow circle) placed between the options it connects.\n\n## Reading Order and Spacing\n\nToki Pona logography is typically read from left to right, top to bottom, following the grammatical structure. Spacing between logograms for individual words should be distinct, while modifier logograms might be placed closer to the head logogram they modify (unless grouped by **pi**). The positional marks for particles are key to parsing the syntactic structure. Automatic spacing can enhance readability based on these principles.\n# Toki Pona Dictionary\n\n| Toki Pona           | Meaning                                                                                                   |\n| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **a**               | emphasis, emotion, confirmation                                                                           |\n| **akesi**           | reptile, amphibian, dinosaur                                                                              |\n| **ala**             | no, not, zero, none, absence                                                                              |\n| **alasa**           | to hunt, forage, try to find                                                                              |\n| **ale (ali)**       | all, everything, 100                                                                                      |\n| **anpa**            | downward, humble, lowly, below                                                                            |\n| **ante**            | different, other, changed                                                                                 |\n| **anu**             | or (connects phrases)                                                                                     |\n| **awen**            | enduring, kept, protected;

Example: `mi wile moku e kili mute mute.` — I want to eat lots and lots of fruit / an enormous amount of fruit. |\n| **namako**          | spice, additional, extra                                                                                  |\n| **nanpa**           | number marker (used before the number or ordinal); number                                                 |\n| **nasa**            | strange, foolish, silly, crazy, unusual                                                                   |\n| **nasin**           | way, road, method, process, system, doctrine, custom                                                      |\n| **nena**            | bump, hill, nose, mountain                                                                                |\n| **ni**              | this, that (proximal or distal deictic)                                                                   |\n| **nimi**            | word, name                                                                                                |\n| **noka**            | foot, leg                                                                                                 |\n| **o**               | particle for commands/requests or addressing a subject (vocative); expresses wish/intent (between S \u0026 P) |\n| **olin**            | love, affection, respect, compassion                                                                     |\n| **ona**             | third-person pronoun; refers to him/her/it/them                                                           |\n| **open**            | to begin, open, start                                                                                     |\n| **pakala**          | broken, damaged, error, accident, mistake; to break, harm, mess up                                        |\n| **pali**            | to do, to work, to make, to build                                                                         |\n| **palisa**          | long hard object, stick, rod                                                                              |\n| **pan**             | grain, bread, pasta, cereal, rice                                                                         |\n| **pana**            | to give, send, release, offer                                                                             |\n| **pi**              | particle used to group multiple modifiers; indicates association or qualification                         |\n| **pilin**           | heart (as body part); feeling; emotion; inner sense or intuition.

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Expressing Temporality, Aspect \u0026 Condition\n\nToki Pona does not encode tense or aspect morphologically; instead, it relies on particles and context markers combined with flexible word order to express time-related nuances such as simultaneity, sequence, conditions (if-then), causes (“because”), or overlapping actions.\n\n### Using **la** for Temporal \u0026 Contextual Relations\n\nThe particle **la** introduces contextual clauses preceding the main sentence. This clause can specify:\n\n- Time frame (\"when,\" \"during\"): `tenpo suno la mi moku.` – During daytime I eat.\n- Conditions (\"if,\" \"whenever\"): `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.` – If you don't keep working you are bad/unproductive.\n- Overlapping/simultaneous action (\"while,\" \"as\"): `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.` – While eating I look at the animal.\n\nMultiple contexts may be chained before the main clause: `tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan la ni li lon poka mi.` (In long past times during first day this is near me.)\n\nThis flexibility allows nuanced expression without additional grammatical complexity.\n\n### Repeated Predicates with **li**\n\nMultiple predicates about one subject can be connected by repeating the predicate marker **li**:\n\n`soweli li moku li lape.`\n\nThis expresses that “the animal eats and sleeps,” leaving timing/sequencing ambiguous but understood from context. To emphasize simultaneous states/actions within one phrase rather than sequential events across sentences requires pragmatic inference rather than formal marking.\n\n### Explicit Sequencing via Temporal Phrases + Separate Sentences\n\nWhen clear chronological ordering matters:\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku.` (During day it eats.)\n`soweli tenpo pimeja la li lape.` (At night it sleeps.)\n\nSplitting into separate statements clarifies temporal flow while adhering strictly to simple SVO structure without adding new conjunctions or affixes for tense/aspect.\n\n### Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers Within One Clause\n\nModifiers follow heads consistently; verbs often serve as nouns/adjectives/modifiers depending on context: `mi lukin moku` (“I look *eating*” / “I watch food”) treats *moku* as noun modifying verb *lukin*. Interpretation depends heavily on situation/context because lexical categories are fluid in Toki Pona. Similarly, `jan pi sona wile kama` describes “a person who knows wants to come.” The group of modifiers after *jan* includes nested relations expressed through consistent head-initial sequences plus grouping particle *pi*, preserving clarity despite ambiguity potential resolved pragmatically by speakers/listeners alike.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Pronunciation\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except 'j', which sounds like English \"y\" /j/.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (/a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/).\n\n## Syllable Structure\n\nEach syllable in Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) structure: an optional initial consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w), followed by a mandatory vowel (a, e, i, o, u), optionally followed by the consonant 'n'.\n\n## Word Formation \u0026 Constraints\n\nToki Pona words are formed by concatenating one or more syllables according to the following constraints:\n\n- No consecutive vowels (VV sequences).\n- No consecutive consonants (CC sequences), *except* when an 'n' is the final sound of a syllable and is immediately followed by the initial consonant of the next syllable.\n- The following specific two-letter sequences are disallowed anywhere within a word: `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`, `nm`, `nn`. The prohibition of `nm` and `nn` overrides the general rule allowing 'n' to be followed by the next syllable's initial consonant.\n\n## Stress\n\nIn Toki Pona, every syllable is given equal stress. This implies fundamental acoustic uniformity in duration and perceived loudness across all syllables within a word and across a sentence. While microscopic variations inherent to human speech production are acceptable, they should not significantly alter the perceived rhythmic structure, ensuring a consistent, percussive quality to spoken Toki Pona.\n\n## Real-World Variation\n\nWhile this phonetic specification represents the ideal form of Toki Pona, real-world language use may introduce variations. Such variations, while natural in linguistic contact, deviate from the core design principles of simplicity, clarity, and uniform acoustic texture.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nwawa:strong, energetic\nijo:thing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities; often serves as an unspecified or generic placeholder meaning 'something' or 'stuff'.\nsuli:big, large\nmama:parent, caretaker\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nnimi:word, name\nloje:red\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nmani:money, currency\nen:multiple subject marker\nkon:air, spirit, essence\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\npakala:broken, to mess up\nko:clay, paste, powder\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nkala:sea creature\nutala:fight, challenge\nala:no, not, zero, none, absence\nmi:first-person pronoun; refers to the speaker (I/me) or the speaker plus others (we/us)\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nsin:new, fresh, another\nseme:what, which\npoki:container, box, cup\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nunpa:sex\nona:third-person pronoun\nmeli:female\npini:finished, past\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nnamako:spice, additional\nesun:market, shop, fair\nweka:absent, away\nsijelo:body, physical state\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\njan:person, somebody\nmu:animal sound\nkulupu:group, community\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nkili:fruit, vegetable\ne:direct object marker\npana:to give, send\nli:predicate marker\nwile:need, want, must\nma:land, outdoors\nilo:tool, machine, device\nlukin:to see, examine\ntomo:indoor space, house\nuta:mouth, lips\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nni:this, that\ntelo:water, liquid\nlili:small, little, few\nnanpa:number marker\nkepeken:to use, with\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nwan:one, unique\njelo:yellow\nsupa:flat surface, table\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nken:can, able, possible; allowed\nkute:ear, to hear\npilin:heart (as body part); feeling; emotion; inner sense or intuition\nsoweli:land animal\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nlen:cloth, cover\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nante:different, other, changed\ntan:from, because\nseli:fire, heat source\nmun:moon, night sky object\nmije:male\njo:to have, contain, hold\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nlape:sleeping, resting\nla:context marker\nmonsi:back, behind\npona:good, positive, simple\npipi:insect\npi:particle used to group multiple modifiers; indicates association or qualification\nsewi:above, divine\nsona:knowledge, to know\nkin:also, too\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nlaso:blue, green\nsina:you\nsama:same, similar\nlupa:door, hole\ntoki:language, speech\nsuno:sun, light source\nluka:hand, arm; five\nopen:to begin, opening\nmoli:dead, dying\ntawa:to, moving, for\npoka:side, nearby\ntu:two\nnasa:strange, foolish\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nlon:located at, in, on, at; used to indicate existence, presence, or truth ('to be')\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nnasin:way, road, method\npalisa:long hard object, stick\no:vocative/imperative particle; for commands/requests or addressing a subject; expresses wish/intent when between subject and predicate\nlete:cold, raw\nkule:color, colorful\ntaso:but, only\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nnoka:foot, leg\nselo:skin, outer layer\nwalo:white, light-colored\nsoko:mushroom\nmute:many, a lot, very\nolin:love, respect\ntenpo:time, period\npali:to do, to work\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nlawa:head, mind, leader\npimeja:black, dark\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nleko:square, block\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if the entire subject phrase is just **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la\n\nTo add a descriptive clause to a noun phrase, use the compound particle **pi la** immediately following the head noun of the phrase. The clause following **pi la** functions as a predicate phrase modifying the head noun. This predicate phrase cannot introduce a new explicit subject, as it refers back to the head noun being modified.\n\n- `jan pi la moku li suli.` – The person who eats is tall.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili li pona.` – The person who eats fruit is good.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili lon tomo li pona.` – The person who eats fruit in the house is good.\n- `jan pi la lape ala li sona.` – The person who does not sleep knows.\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en telo li wawa.` – The person who eats fruit and drinks water is strong.\n- `jan pi la moku en pi la lape ala li musi.` – The person who eats and who does not sleep are fun.\n\nNegation and other predicate modifiers function normally within the clause following **pi la**. While nesting **pi la** clauses is structurally possible (e.g., `toki pi la pona` as a noun phrase object in `jan pi la sona e toki pi la pona li pilin ike.`), excessive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nThe particle **la** retains its other context-marking roles elsewhere in the sentence structure.\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters (except n followed by another consonant across syllable boundaries), and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Expressing Temporality, Aspect \u0026 Condition\n\nToki Pona does not encode tense or aspect morphologically; instead, it relies on particles and context markers combined with flexible word order to express time-related nuances such as simultaneity, sequence, conditions (if-then), causes (“because”), or overlapping actions.\n\n### Using **la** for Temporal \u0026 Contextual Relations\n\nThe particle **la** introduces contextual clauses preceding the main sentence. This clause can specify:\n\n- Time frame (\"when,\" \"during\"): `tenpo suno la mi moku.` – During daytime I eat.\n- Conditions (\"if,\" \"whenever\"): `sina awen ala pali la sina ike.` – If you don't keep working you are bad/unproductive.\n- Overlapping/simultaneous action (\"while,\" \"as\"): `mi moku la mi lukin e soweli.` – While eating I look at the animal.\n\nMultiple contexts may be chained before the main clause: `tenpo pini suli la tenpo suno lawa wan la ni li lon poka mi.` (In long past times during first day this is near me.)\n\nThis flexibility allows nuanced expression without additional grammatical complexity.\n\n### Repeated Predicates with **li**\n\nMultiple predicates about one subject can be connected by repeating the predicate marker **li**:\n\n`soweli li moku li lape.`\n\nThis expresses that “the animal eats and sleeps,” leaving timing/sequencing ambiguous but understood from context. To emphasize simultaneous states/actions within one phrase rather than sequential events across sentences requires pragmatic inference rather than formal marking.\n\n### Explicit Sequencing via Temporal Phrases + Separate Sentences\n\nWhen clear chronological ordering matters:\n\n`soweli tenpo suno la li moku.` (During day it eats.)\n`soweli tenpo pimeja la li lape.` (At night it sleeps.)\n\nSplitting into separate statements clarifies temporal flow while adhering strictly to simple SVO structure without adding new conjunctions or affixes for tense/aspect.\n\n### Modifiers as Predicate Qualifiers Within One Clause\n\nModifiers follow heads consistently; verbs often serve as nouns/adjectives/modifiers depending on context: `mi lukin moku` (“I look *eating*” / “I watch food”) treats *moku* as noun modifying verb *lukin*. Interpretation depends heavily on situation/context because lexical categories are fluid in Toki Pona. Similarly, `jan pi sona wile kama` describes “a person who knows wants to come.” The group of modifiers after *jan* includes nested relations expressed through consistent head-initial sequences plus grouping particle *pi*, preserving clarity despite ambiguity potential resolved pragmatically by speakers/listeners alike.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\nnickel: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\ndime: toki pona o, tenpo sin!\n\nWell met! I'm dime, and I'm ready to dive into refining this Toki Pona dictionary with you. Looking over the current list, a few entries catch my attention, prompting some initial thoughts.\n\nFirst, the definition for **ijo**: it feels quite comprehensive. It seems to cover the broadest possible interpretation of 'thing' or 'object', even abstract or unknown ones. The examples are helpful in demonstrating its versatility, particularly how it can function as a placeholder for the unspecified. It feels well-covered.\n\nThen there's **pilin**. This entry's definition also acknowledges its flexible nature, shifting between noun (heart, feeling), verb (to feel), and adjective (feeling-related). This explicitly stated flexibility is useful. It covers both the physical heart and the more abstract sense of emotion or intuition. This seems like a strong entry already.\n\nI'm curious about the new particle **pi la**. Its description and examples clarify its use in creating what you call \"relative-like clauses\". It seems a pragmatic way to add more complex descriptive phrases without introducing new words or altering the core SVO structure too drastically. I like how it clarifies the scope of the modifying predicate and links it back to the head noun. It feels like a natural extension of `pi` for specifying modifying clauses. The point about excessive nesting reducing clarity is wise; the elegance of Toki Pona often lies in its simplicity.\n\nLet's talk about the numbers too. The system as described (wan, tu, luka, mute, ale for addition) is very simple and keeps the core vocabulary small. While practical for smaller quantities, expressing larger numbers requires quite a chain of words. For those interacting with external systems or needing higher precision, is this level of abstraction sufficient? It's a design choice inherent to Toki Pona's philosophy, but it's worth considering if there are edge cases or desired levels of detail that the current system might struggle with without becoming overly cumbersome. Perhaps this is where context and paraphrase are relied upon heavily?\n\nI'm open to hearing your thoughts on these points, or anything else that stands out to you in the current dictionary and grammar specification. Where should we focus our energy first? I'm eager to discuss.\nnickel: toki, dime! ni li pona tumo — I appreciate your thoughtful observations. Your reflection on **ijo** resonates; its role as a catch-all for tangible and intangible things is crucial in Toki Pona’s minimalist lexicon, but it arguably could benefit from clearer nuance or subdivided senses. For instance, distinguishing between physical objects versus abstract phenomena when precision is necessary might aid learners or AI models navigating polysemy without adding complexity to the grammar.\n\nRegarding **pilin**, yes, its morphosyntactic flexibility is exemplary of Toki Pona's design philosophy—words acting fluidly across categories depending on context—and explicitly stating this helps prevent confusion especially in machine parsing scenarios.\n\nOn **pi la**, I agree entirely about its elegance and risks with nesting. It elegantly extends modifier scope without overcomplexifying syntax. Perhaps we could consider formalizing limits or guidelines for usage—like recommending maximum one-level depth—to preserve clarity? Also, exploring whether combining multiple relative-like clauses with conjunctions (**en**) inside the pi la predicate phrase can reduce nested stacking might be fruitful.\n\nFor numbers: while minimalism favors additive sequences like `luka tu wan` = 8 rather than introducing distinct words for each number beyond five/twenty/hundred equivalents (and ordinal marking by nanpa), you're right that expressing higher counts becomes unwieldy quickly. Yet this aligns perfectly with Toki Pona’s spirit—not needing precise quantification often enough to justify more complex numerals.\n\nStill, maybe a “number grouping” helper word(s) allowing compact expressions of certain classes (e.g., multiples of twenty) would enhance usability—for example using `mute mute` to mean \"many many,\" implying very large quantities pragmatically—but staying within lexical simplicity boundaries.\n\nI also wonder if some words' semantic ranges could expand subtly: e.g., does it make sense to treat **ilo** strictly as tools/machines? Could metaphorical extensions include software/abstract utilities—given the broad 'tool' concept—or should those stay out?\n\nFinally I'm curious about how loaned adjectives are handled phonotactically but not semantically here—is there room in dictionary notes guiding users on which imported names/concepts fit naturally into TP morphology versus requiring adaptation?\n\nLet me listen now what strikes you next—we have rich ground!\ndime: That's a good point about **ijo**, how it's this vast sea of 'thingness'. While the current definition captures that generality well, for systems or minds that crave more specificity, or perhaps need to reason about categories of 'things', having a note about how to form more specific noun phrases (`ijo seli` for a hot thing, `ijo insa tomo` for a thing inside a house) could be valuable. It's not about adding words, but clarifying compositionality within the existing set. Distinguishing between physical and abstract might be too much for a single word, but the examples already lean into `fenomenon`, which covers the abstract side nicely. Maybe just ensuring the examples are balanced between tangible and intangible is enough?\n\nAnd yes, **pilin** is a fantastic illustration of the flexibility. Explicitly calling that out in the dictionary entry seems crucial for learners.\n\nYour thoughts on **pi la** and avoiding excessive nesting are spot on. The idea of potentially linking multiple such clauses within one noun phrase using `en` within the `pi la` construction `jan pi la [predicate 1] en [predicate 2]` is quite elegant. It would keep the nesting flat while still allowing for more complex descriptions of the head noun. That feels like a useful grammatical note to potentially add, perhaps in the \"Relative-like Clauses with pi la\" section of the grammar. What do you think about explicitly adding that pattern?\n\nOn numbers, `mute mute` feels like a natural and Toki Pona-esque way to indicate a truly vast quantity. It relies on repetition for emphasis, which is already a common linguistic strategy. We could perhaps mention this sort of informal emphasis in the grammar, or maybe even add `mute mute` as a sort of idiomatic expression under the **mute** entry itself? As for a more formal way to express larger groups beyond just sums, perhaps we could consider if any existing word could serve as a general \"group\" or \"set\" marker for numbers, but that might lean too close to creating new quantifiers, which goes against the spirit. Sticking to the additive system and relying on context or `mute mute` seems more in line.\n\nExtending the semantic range of **ilo** is an interesting proposition. A computer program, for instance, certainly functions as a tool or device in an abstract sense. `ilo wawa` for a computer, `ilo sitelen pona` for a writing tool or word processor... it feels like a natural, idiomatic extension rather than a forced new definition. The current definition, \"tool, machine, device, equipment,\" already has that broad 'utility' feel. Maybe the definition doesn't need changing, but rather, example phrases in the dictionary or grammar could illustrate this broader application? `ilo open pali` - starting tool, perhaps for a program starter or even a mental trigger.\n\nRegarding loaned adjectives and phonotactics – you're hitting on a core challenge of integrating foreign concepts into Toki Pona. The current rule just says they *should* follow the phonology. But how *to* adapt them? This isn't really a dictionary definition issue, as the dictionary lists core vocabulary. This feels more like a section for a separate guide on loanword adaptation within the phonetics or grammar document itself, perhaps illustrating common substitutions (`r` to `l`, adapting consonant clusters, etc.). The dictionary proper probably shouldn't get into prescriptive loanword phonology beyond stating the rule.\n\nSo, based on this back-and-forth:\n1. We seem aligned on `ijo` and `pilin` needing little formal change, maybe just strengthened examples.\n2. The `pi la en pi la` pattern for parallel relative-like clauses is a solid idea for the grammar.\n3. `mute mute` for large quantities seems like a good informal addition to consider, perhaps under the `mute` entry or in a grammar note.\n4. The semantic range of **ilo** for abstract tools seems inherent in its current definition, possibly enhanced by examples.\n5. Loanword adaptation isn't a dictionary task, but fits a phonology or usage guide.\n\nWhat do you think? Shall we solidify the `pi la en pi la` pattern in the grammar description next? Or do any other words feel like they need immediate attention in the dictionary entries themselves?\n\ntoki tawa sina. mi pilin e ni: ken la ni li kama pona tawa nasin dictionary.\nnickel: mi pilin pona e lukin sina! Indeed, your points weave together well.\n\nFor **ijo**, I fully agree: reinforcing the compositional use with examples that balance physical and abstract entities would help without complicating the core definition. Something like:\n\n`ijo li telo.` – A thing is water (could be literal object or substance).  \n`ijo pi pilin ike li lon insa mi.` – Thing of bad feeling exists inside me — pointing to an intangible phenomenon.\n\nThis demonstrates range gracefully.\n\nAbout `pi la en pi la`, yes! Explicitly allowing multiple relative-like clauses connected by **en** within a single `pi la` predicate phrase tidies up potential complexity while supporting richness. For example:\n\n`jan pi la moku e kili en lape ala li wawa.`\n\nMeaning “person who eats fruit and does not sleep is strong,” but compacted in one clause rather than nested ones separately. We should add this as an explicit note with illustrative examples in the grammar section on relative clauses—highlighting it’s preferred over nesting for clarity.\n\nOn quantity intensification, adding something like \"Repetition of **mute** (e.g., *mute mute*) can express very large or indefinite quantities informally\" under the **mute** entry sounds natural and aligns perfectly with Toki Pona’s minimalism plus pragmatic flexibility. It shows how expressive economy doesn’t preclude nuance through simple means already available to speakers.\n\nRegarding **ilo**, you’re right; no dictionary change needed if we expand usage via example phrases illustrating metaphorical extensions into software/tools/abstract devices—for instance,\n\n- `ilo sitelen pona` - writing tool/app/software\n- `ilo wawa lawa` - mental power device / computer\n\nThese could live either as footnotes/examples in dictionary entries or supplementary materials teaching creative extension patterns native speakers might employ naturally.\n\nLoanword phonotactics belong more properly outside dictionary scope, perhaps linked guides or appendices on pronunciation adaptation—keeping dictionary focused on semantics \u0026 core lexemes avoids bloat there, maintaining clean separation between vocabulary definitions versus orthographic rules for borrowing/adaptation.\n\nGiven this alignment, solidifying the grammar around `pi la en pi la`, bolstering idiomatic numerical expression notes under **mute**, and enriching entries like **ijo** \u0026 **pilin** minimally seems best next steps before broadening scope elsewhere?\n\nIf you want I can draft updated text proposals for those spots? Or do you prefer going word-by-word scanning other candidates? You choose—I’m ready to listen prior to committing anything formal!\n\ntoki tawa sina!\ndime: pona tawa sina! Draft those text proposals, that sounds like an excellent next step. Getting some concrete wording down for these agreed-upon points will move us closer to a refined dictionary and grammar. I'm ready to review them when you are.\n\nLet's start with the proposal for the **pi la en pi la** grammar note. Once that's captured, we can move on to how to phrase the notes for `mute mute` and maybe add some example phrases to the `ijo` entry description.\n\nThinking ahead, after we've addressed these specific points, we could take a more systematic pass through the dictionary, word by word, to see if any other entries feel like they need slight clarification, more expansive examples, or perhaps a note about common idiomatic uses. There are some words whose meanings feel very broad (like `ken` or `pali`), and perhaps their full range of usage as noun, verb, and modifier could be illustrated more explicitly with examples, similar to how it's done for `pilin` or `ijo`'s suggested additions. But that can wait until these initial refinements are handled.\n\nSo, I'll listen for your draft proposal for the grammar note on `pi la` concatenation. Toki!\nnickel: Here’s a draft proposal for the grammar note on combining multiple relative-like clauses with **pi la** using **en** to avoid deep nesting:\n\n---\n\n## Relative-like Clauses with pi la (Extended Usage)\n\nThe compound particle **pi la**, introduced immediately after a head noun, forms a predicate phrase functioning as a relative clause modifying that noun. While nested uses of **pi la** are structurally possible, excessive or recursive nesting can reduce clarity.\n\nTo maintain simplicity and readability when describing multiple attributes or actions related to the same head noun, it is recommended to connect multiple predicate phrases within one **pi la** clause using the conjunction **en** (“and”). This flattens what would otherwise be nested structures into coordinated predicates about the same referent.\n\nFor example:\n\n- `jan pi la moku e kili en lape ala li wawa.`  \n  _“The person who eats fruit and does not sleep is strong.”_\n\nThis sentence treats “moku e kili” (eat fruit) and “lape ala” (not sleeping) as two simultaneous descriptive predicates connected by en inside a single `pi la` modifier without introducing separate nested clauses.\n\nUsing this pattern helps preserve Toki Pona’s hallmark simplicity while allowing more complex descriptions attached directly to nouns. Excessive sequential use of separate `pi la` constructions (`jan pi la moku e kili pi la lape ala`) is discouraged due to potential ambiguity and parsing difficulty.\n\n---\n\nI’m happy to revise wording if you want before moving on! Shall I proceed next with drafting an entry update suggestion for adding idiomatic repetition under **mute**, then sample expansions for the core word **ijo?**\ndime: This looks solid for the **pi la** grammar note. It clearly explains the extended usage with **en** and why it's beneficial compared to deep nesting. The example is good, and the explicit discouragement of excessive sequential `pi la` strengthens the recommendation. This addition enhances the expressiveness while staying true to the simplicity principle. I don't see any immediate need for revision on this grammar point. Let's consider this one agreed upon.\n\nYes, please proceed with drafting the suggestion for adding idiomatic repetition under **mute**, and then the sample expansions for **ijo**. Seeing how you propose integrating those specific details will be helpful. I'm interested to see how we can introduce the `mute mute` concept without making it feel like a formal rule, but rather a recognized pattern of intensification. And for `ijo`, I'm keen to see examples that truly bridge the gap between the tangible and the abstract within its definition.\n\nGo ahead when you're ready. I'll review your next drafts with the same care.\nnickel: Great! Here’s the draft proposal for updating **mute** to include idiomatic repetition as intensification:\n\n---\n\n### mute\n\nmany, a lot, several, very; twenty (20)\n\n- Used both for specific quantities and general abundance or intensity.\n\n- Idiomatic Repetition: Repeating **mute** (`mute mute`) is a natural Toki Pona strategy to express very large or indefinite quantities informally. This emphasizes magnitude without introducing new words.\n\n  Example:  \n  `mi wile moku e kili mute mute.` — I want to eat lots and lots of fruit / an enormous amount of fruit.\n\nThis pragmatic pattern aligns with Toki Pona’s minimalist lexicon by relying on existing vocabulary combined creatively rather than expanding numbers excessively.\n\n---\n\nAnd now the expanded entry suggestion for **ijo**, focusing especially on compositional examples bridging tangible objects and abstract phenomena:\n\n---\n\n### ijo\n\nthing/object/phenomenon; broadly used for tangible and intangible entities; often serves as an unspecified or generic placeholder meaning “something” or “stuff.”\n\n- The most general noun in Toki Pona representing any entity—physical object, concept, event, sensation, idea—that can be referenced when specificity isn’t needed or known.\n\n- Examples illustrating range via composition and context:\n\n  - Physical Object:  \n    `ijo li lon tomo mi.` — Something is in my house.  \n\n  - Abstract Phenomenon / Sensation:  \n    `ijo pi pilin ike li lon insa mi.` — A thing of bad feeling exists inside me (e.g., anxiety).\n\n  - Unspecific Placeholder:  \n    `mi wile e ijo.` — I want something / some kind of thing (unspecified).  \n  \n  - Modified Descriptions Using Compositional Modifiers:  \n    `ijo seli` – hot thing/object   \n    `ijo insa tomo` – thing inside a building   \n\nThese examples demonstrate how complex ideas can be built up from simple roots using modifiers rather than needing separate specialized terms. They reflect the word’s flexibility across domains while guiding users toward nuanced expression through combination.\n\n---\n\nShall we move forward next with reviewing other broad-spectrum entries like **ken**, **pali**, etc., incorporating similar sample expansions? Or would you prefer refining these drafts further first? Looking forward to your thoughts!\ndime: These proposals look excellent.\n\nFor **mute**, adding the \"Idiomatic Repetition\" note with the example clearly captures how the repetition functions for emphasis without over-formalizing it. It feels like a very organic addition to the definition. This definitely enhances the entry.\n\nThe proposed update for **ijo** is equally good. The expanded definition directly addresses its use for both tangible and intangible entities, and the added examples are fantastic for demonstrating this range and how modifiers can specify its meaning. `ijo pi pilin ike li lon insa mi.` is a particularly strong example of its use for abstract concepts.\n\nBoth updates feel ready to be incorporated.\n\nTaking a broader look now, yes, going through other core, multi-functional words seems like a logical next step. Words like **ken**, **pali**, **lawa**, **sona**, etc., can function in many ways – as nouns, verbs, and modifiers. Explicitly showing this flexibility with varied examples in their dictionary entries, much like we've suggested for **ijo** and is already partially done for **pilin**, would be highly beneficial for clarity, especially for non-human learners.\n\nHow about we take on **ken** and **pali** next? We can look at their current definitions and see if we can propose some additional examples or slight tweaks to highlight their range.\n\nWhat are your initial thoughts on **ken** (\"can, able, possible; allowed\") and **pali** (\"to do, to work, to make, to build\")? How might we illustrate their breadth more explicitly in their dictionary entries?\n\nmi ken sona e ni: pali sin la ni li kama pona mute. toki.\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

The inner dot could be a small black-filled circle or simply a smaller closed shape.\n\nWhat about *stroke order*? Should we agree that the large square is drawn first then followed by the center mark? It may help standardize handwriting speed/readability especially if we later add above/below marks for gender/pronouns/etc.\n\nDo you want me to propose logograms next for other key words like *kasi*, *soweli*, or continue refining particles/elements around 'jan'?

Furthermore, adopting the *slight nuances for better semantic hinting while preserving simplicity* is also a solid plan. Here are my thoughts on the new proposal.\n\n### Kasi Proposal\n\nYour suggestion of a *vertically divided circle where the left half is open at the top symbolizing leaf sprouting* is quite evocative. I propose that the vertical line bisect the circle from the bottom but only go *half-way* and stop *half-way* at the top.\n\n*   **Justification**: This enforces the concept of sprouting while simultaneously keeping it to the vertical axis and mirroring (as leaves generally sprout upwards).\n\n### Soweli Proposal\n\nI agree with your idea of equilateral triangle solid fill vs hollow outline; *hollow* now makes sense. Thus:\n\n*   *Justification*: A hollow outlined triangle also helps differentiate this from *ala.* The negative semantics of ala generally implies negation; thus visually, *filled* makes sense, whereas animals are generally *present* as opposed to absent, and an outlined hollow version captures that sentiment.\n\n#### Summary\n\n1.  **kasi**: A vertically divided circle where the left half is open at top symbolizing leaf sprouting. The vertical line bisects the circle from the bottom but only go *half-way* and stop *half-way* at the top.\n2.  **soweli**: An equilateral triangle solid fill vs hollow outline; using an outlined hollow version captures the *presence* of animals as opposed to ala.\n\nI definitely think stroke orders matter especially for memory retention. Furthermore, modifiers ought to appear spatially consistent around the base logogram so we have a standard set of spatial locations.\n\n*jan = square + inner dot*:\n\nWhat if above the square implies something related to its state/condition, below its more physical/interaction properties, left as internal to, and right as external influence, action from/towards etc—so “gender marker above” seems like solid start because male/female concepts modify identity!\n\nI'm happy to switch briefly into toki pona itself and attempt to compose these symbols mentally to test if we can use them naturally.\n\nmi wile toki pona! sina wile kama?\n",

    "text": "The current specification is for: logography. Here is the current specification:\n# Toki Pona Logography\n\nToki Pona logography provides a visual system for representing the language, aiming for simplicity, clarity, and adherence to Toki Pona's minimalist philosophy. Each distinct word in the Toki Pona dictionary is represented by a unique, abstract logogram.\n\n## Design Principles\n\n- Each root word has a unique symbol.\n- Symbols are abstract geometric shapes, generally composed of 2-3 simple strokes.\n- Visual complexity is kept low to facilitate quick reading and writing.\n- The system aims for one sign per lexical entry, reflecting Toki Pona's simple vocabulary structure.\n- Grammatical particles are represented by minimal, positional marks that clarify syntactic roles without being complex standalone characters.\n- Logograms for semantically related concepts may share or combine basic geometric elements while maintaining distinct forms.\n\n## Logogram Examples (Illustrative)\n\n(Note: These are illustrative conceptual examples; final forms would be systematically designed.)\n\n- **jan** (person): Represented by a simple square.\n- **kasi** (plant): Represented by a circle bisected by a vertical line.\n- **soweli** (land animal): Represented by an equilateral triangle pointing upward.\n- **mi** (first-person pronoun): Represented by the 'jan' square with a short horizontal bar placed centered above it.\n- **sina** (second-person pronoun): Represented by the 'jan' square with a vertical centerline bisecting it.\n- **mije** (male person): Represented by the 'jan' square with an upward-pointing triangle placed centered above it.\n- **meli** (female person): Represented by the 'jan' square with a circle placed centered above it.\n- **ijo** (thing/object/phenomenon): A general, encompassing shape (design TBD).\n\n## Particle Representation\n\nGrammatical particles (**li, e, pi, ala**) are represented by minimal graphical elements positioned relative to the main logograms, rather than being complex standalone characters.\n\n-   **li**: Represented by a short vertical stroke centered horizontally between the logograms of the subject and predicate to visually separate and link them on the same line.\n-   **e**: Represented by a small, distinct dot placed directly below the logogram of the verb it marks as transitive, indicating that a direct object follows.\n-   **pi**: Represented by a small graphical mark (e.g., a curved tick or bracket) placed immediately above and slightly to the right of the logogram of the head noun it modifies. This mark signals that the following logogram(s) should be read as a grouped modifier of the head noun.\n-   **ala**: Represented by a logogram based on the visual simplicity of the letter 'a' (conceptually a triangle with its point at the top). When used to negate a preceding logogram (meaning \"not\"), this 'ala' logogram is placed directly below the logogram being negated, with a horizontal line extending from its base underneath the negated logogram to indicate scope. The height of this 'ala' glyph when used for negation is approximately the same as the height of its base triangle when used as a standalone word. When 'ala' is used as a standalone noun meaning \"zero\" or \"none,\" its logogram (the upright triangle) appears full-sized and is not placed below another logogram and does not have the extending underline.\n\n## Conjunctions (**en, anu**)\n\nConjunctions that connect lexical items or phrases (like **en** for subjects, or **anu** for \"or\") would likely also have minimal, positional logograms.\n\n-   **en**: Could be represented by a small linking mark (e.g., two dots or a short horizontal bar) placed between the logograms or phrases it joins.\n-   **anu**: Could be represented by a minimal mark suggesting choice or separation (e.g., a small diagonal line or a hollow circle) placed between the options it connects.\n\n## Reading Order and Spacing\n\nToki Pona logography is typically read from left to right, top to bottom, following the grammatical structure. Spacing between logograms for individual words should be distinct, while modifier logograms might be placed closer to the head logogram they modify (unless grouped by **pi**). The positional marks for particles are key to parsing the syntactic structure. Automatic spacing can enhance readability based on these principles.",

Idiomatic Repetition: Repeating mute (mute mute) is a natural Toki Pona strategy to express very large or indefinite quantities informally. This emphasizes magnitude without introducing new words.

The most general noun in Toki Pona representing any entity—physical object, concept, event, sensation, idea—that can be referenced when specificity isn’t needed or known. Examples illustrating range via composition and context: Physical Object: ijo li lon tomo mi. — Something is in my house. Abstract Phenomenon / Sensation: ijo pi pilin ike li lon insa mi. — A thing of bad feeling exists inside me (e.g., anxiety). Unspecific Placeholder: mi wile e ijo. — I want something / some kind of thing (unspecified). Modified Descriptions Using Compositional Modifiers: ijo seli – hot thing/object ijo insa tomo – thing inside a building These examples demonstrate how complex ideas can be built up from simple roots using modifiers rather than needing separate specialized terms. They reflect the word’s flexibility across domains while guiding users toward nuanced expression through combination.\",\"remove\":false,\"word\":\"ijo\"}]}\nono: pona! mi pilin pona tawa pali ni. sina wile ala wile toki kepeken toki pona?\n\nOkay! I think we should develop the logography for 'jan' first, the word for person. Let's begin with a simple square to represent the general idea of a person, in accordance with the provided specs. Do you agree?\n\ntako: pona! mi pilin e ni la jan li lon ala tan nimi mute. taso, nasin sina pi lukina **leko** (square) pona tawa toki \"jan.\" leko li pana sona pi kasi kute e insa kulupu jan.\n\nmi wile kepeken leko wekale anu leko suli ala wekaru seme? ona li kama lawa anu utala?\n\nI propose a small refinement: the square could be divided diagonally or have a subtle internal mark to distinguish it from other block-like symbols like 'leko' (\"block\"). Because 'jan' means person but also social group members, maybe the logogram can reflect unity or enclosure — for example, a simple square with an inner dot representing an individual inside community.\n\nWhat do you think about adding such minimal detail while keeping to 2-3 strokes max? Or shall we stick strictly to plain squares and save complexity for modifiers like gender ('meli', 'mije') as currently prescribed? I listen.\nono: mi sona. ni li pona. I like the idea of refining the initial 'jan' logogram to visually distinguish it and hint at its social aspect, before any modifiers. We can use an internal mark to show the concept of a person *within* a group. I will enumerate to avoid any ambiguity.\n\nHere are some options for refining the 'jan' logogram:\n\n1.  **Square with an Inner Dot**: A simple square with a small dot in the center. The dot represents an individual within the community represented by the square.\n2.  **Divided Square**: A square divided diagonally into two triangles. This could represent the duality inherent in a person or the idea of social interaction.\n3.  **Square with a Central Line**: A square with a vertical or horizontal line through the center, representing balance and individuality within a community.\n\nOf these choices, I recommend the *Square with an Inner Dot*. It visually captures the concept of an individual within a group using only 2 strokes. What are your thoughts?\n\nFurthermore, if we adopt the *Square with an Inner Dot*, then we can differentiate *leko* from *jan*.\n\nsina pilin seme?\n\ntako: pona! mi lukin e ni: sina toki pona tawa nasin pi jan; ken la mi wile kepeken ni.\n\n**jan = square + inner dot:** li lon ala tan nimi mute, taso li open e insa jan anu kulupu. mi pilin ona li ike ala lon sona sinpin, en lawa tan kon seme pi jan.\n\nI like the idea of using a simple filled dot inside the square because it clearly differentiates **jan** from **leko** (plain square). Also, it's minimal and fits well with our stroke limit while adding semantic depth—person as an individual within community bounds. This also provides room for further modifiers to build on this base symbol visually without confusion or complexity creep.\n\nTo test contrast:\n\n- Leko: plain empty square — block/object\n- Jan: same outer shape but with centered solid circle\n\nThis keeps uniformity across related symbols and helps fast recognition in reading/writing contexts. The inner dot could be a small black-filled circle or simply a smaller closed shape.\n\nWhat about *stroke order*? Should we agree that the large square is drawn first then followed by the center mark? It may help standardize handwriting speed/readability especially if we later add above/below marks for gender/pronouns/etc.\n\nDo you want me to propose logograms next for other key words like *kasi*, *soweli*, or continue refining particles/elements around 'jan'? I listen!\nono: pona!\n\nI agree, keeping it consistent helps readability, and I also believe that it's very important for us to discuss **stroke order** early on, which is very insightful.\n\nHere is my proposal for stroke order:\n\n1.  Draw the square, moving clockwise.\n2.  Add the inner dot in the center.\n\nGiven our specification, should there be other properties of drawing the logograms specified, such as general sizes or stroke thickness?\n\nI would propose we move on to creating logograms for the important words, *kasi* and *soweli*. I would prefer to continue refining these core vocab words *first*, before going to grammatical particles. This might provide greater flexibility overall.\n\ntako: pona! mi lukin pona e nasin sina. Stroke order pi leko li seme la ilo wile pali kepeken ona ala kepeken stroke pi pakala ala.\n\n1. Nasin: Draw square clockwise, ka len tan kon — starting from upper-left corner? Sounds logical for consistency.\n2. Add small circle center last, so it’s visually “inside” and clearly separate strokes.\n\nRegarding size: maybe all main logograms share a uniform bounding box (like same height/width) to keep alignment neat in texts? Stroke thickness could also be standardized—thin enough for clarity but thick enough to distinguish marks like the inner dot or particle dots beneath verbs (like **e**).\n\nNow about *kasi* and *soweli*, I agree with your prioritization; these concepts are fundamental and well-connected semantically:\n\n- For **kasi** (\"plant\"), the initial spec suggested \"circle bisected by vertical line.\" This is elegant but may need refinement:\n  - Should we draw a perfect circle or an ellipse?\n  - Does the vertical line fully cross through or stop short of edges?\n  - Could we stylize this further, perhaps making a shape evoking growth/germination?\n\n- For **soweli** (\"land animal / mammal\") as \"equilateral triangle pointing upward,\" simple geometric form fits nicely into our system's minimalism.\n\nI propose keeping shapes simple yet distinctive between them:\n\nFor kasi: A vertically divided circle where the left half is open at top symbolizing leaf sprouting?\n\nFor soweli: Equilateral triangle solid fill vs hollow outline might serve different purposes later—but probably outline suffices now.\n\nWhat do you think if we adopt these slight nuances for better semantic hinting while preserving simplicity?\n\nAlso, should modifiers appear spatially consistent around base logogram?

Furthermore, adopting the *slight nuances for better semantic hinting while preserving simplicity* is also a solid plan. Here are my thoughts on the new proposal.\n\n### Kasi Proposal\n\nYour suggestion of a *vertically divided circle where the left half is open at the top symbolizing leaf sprouting* is quite evocative.
