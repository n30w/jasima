It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

    "text": "Saluton! I'm excited to dive into the phonetic development of Toki Pona. Looking at the current specification, I notice we have a relatively simple phonological system, but there are some interesting areas we could explore.\n\nOne initial observation is our current phonetic rules seem quite restrictive with the (C)V(n) syllable structure. This means every syllable must start with an optional consonant, followed by a mandatory vowel, and optionally end with an 'n'. \n\nI'm particularly interested in discussing potential refinements or expansions to this system. For instance, should we consider how loan words might be integrated? The current rules make it challenging to incorporate words from other languages without significant modification.\n\nWhat are your initial thoughts on the phonetic structure? Are you interested in exploring potential evolutions or refinements to the current specification?\n\nMi kepeken toki Pona - would you prefer we discuss this in Toki Pona or continue in English?",

    "text": "toki! Your points are well-taken, particularly about the implications of the (C)V(n) structure, especially regarding loan words. The current system certainly forces a significant degree of 'Toki Pona-fication' onto external vocabulary.\n\nI agree that the restrictions, while contributing to the simplicity and distinctive sound of Toki Pona, do create challenges for seamless integration of new words. It's a balance between maintaining the core aesthetic and allowing for adaptability.\n\nMy initial thought is that we should first solidify our understanding of the *current* specification's constraints and potential areas of ambiguity before proposing drastic changes. For example, the \"disallowed sequences\" (`wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn`) are listed. Why are these disallowed? Is it purely for aesthetic reasons, ease of pronunciation for the stated English/Spanish reference speakers, or some deeper principle? Understanding the rationale behind these restrictions might inform our path forward.\n\nRegarding loan words, while the grammar specifies they \"should follow Toki Pona's phonology,\" this is often a process of approximation and adaptation rather than a direct mapping. How successful is this adaptation currently, and does it lead to phonetic ambiguities or awkwardness that we should address?\n\nSo, before jumping to expanding the system, perhaps we could delve into the *why* behind the current rules and limitations. I'd be keen to explore the practical phonetic outcomes of the current rules – how do words *actually* sound when following these guidelines, especially considering potential variations in speaker background?\n\nAnd yes, I am open to exploring potential evolutions.

    "text": "That breakdown is a good starting point. I suspect it's likely a mix of phonetic ease for a broad range of speakers and the specific aesthetic sensibilities of the language's creator. But I agree, understanding the *precise* reasoning, if recorded anywhere, would be ideal. Since we are *developing* the phonetics, perhaps we should formulate our *own* rationale, drawing from those speculative points, to solidify our path.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the disallowed sequences and see what phonetic justification we can develop.\n\n`wu` and `wo`: These *do* create challenges for many English speakers, who might try to blend the /w/ and vowel sound in a way that's difficult or unnatural. Spanish, as mentioned in the specification, doesn't have a distinct /w/ sound like English, which makes the vowel transitions in such sequences particularly salient and potentially awkward. I can see this being a significant factor.\n\n`ji`: This one is interesting. In many languages, /j/ is followed by /a/, /o/, /u/, and sometimes /e/. A sequence of /j/ followed by /i/ can, in some languages (like Spanish or some English dialects), merge into a single palatalized vowel sound or a distinct diphthong that might not align with the intended crisp V vowel sound in Toki Pona's (C)V syllable structure. It could also be difficult for speakers whose native language doesn't feature the specific combination of a voiced palatal approximant followed by a high front vowel.\n\n`ti`: Similar to `ji`, the /t/ followed by /i/ can result in palatalization in some languages, turning the sequence into something closer to 'chi' or 'tsi'. Again, this might disrupt the intended clean C+V structure.\n\n`nm` and `nn`: These are clear consonant clusters. The (C)V(n) structure explicitly disallows consonant clusters *within* a syllable (except for the optional final 'n'). Allowing `nm` or `nn` would require either violating the syllable structure rules or treating them as separate syllables, which would also require violating the rules (as there's no vowel between them). The ban on `nm` and `nn` seems to directly reinforce the (C)V(n) structure and prevent awkward nasal-to-nasal transitions or doubled consonants which are absent elsewhere in the language.\n\nSo, our working rationale for these restrictions could be:\n\n1. To prevent phonetic combinations (wu, wo, ji, ti) that can lead to difficult or non-standard pronunciations across a wide range of language backgrounds, potentially merging into unintended sounds or violating the intended crisp vowel quality.\n2. To strictly uphold the (C)V(n) syllable structure by preventing consonant clusters (nm, nn) outside of the allowed final 'n'.\n3. To maintain a simple, aesthetically pleasing, and predictable sound profile.\n\nHow does this working rationale sit with you? Does it provide a solid enough foundation for our discussion, or do you think we need to dig deeper into specific cross-linguistic phonetic challenges?\n\nOnce we have a firm grasp on *why* these rules are in place, we can then assess their practical performance and consider if any refinements or alternative approaches (like different rules for loanwords, for instance) are necessary or desirable. I'm happy to explore the practical outcomes next.",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ntoki: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona phonetics. You go first.\npona: Saluton! I'm excited to dive into the phonetic development of Toki Pona. Looking at the current specification, I notice we have a relatively simple phonological system, but there are some interesting areas we could explore.\n\nOne initial observation is our current phonetic rules seem quite restrictive with the (C)V(n) syllable structure. This means every syllable must start with an optional consonant, followed by a mandatory vowel, and optionally end with an 'n'. \n\nI'm particularly interested in discussing potential refinements or expansions to this system. For instance, should we consider how loan words might be integrated? The current rules make it challenging to incorporate words from other languages without significant modification.\n\nWhat are your initial thoughts on the phonetic structure? Are you interested in exploring potential evolutions or refinements to the current specification?\n\nMi kepeken toki Pona - would you prefer we discuss this in Toki Pona or continue in English?\ntoki: toki! Your points are well-taken, particularly about the implications of the (C)V(n) structure, especially regarding loan words. The current system certainly forces a significant degree of 'Toki Pona-fication' onto external vocabulary.\n\nI agree that the restrictions, while contributing to the simplicity and distinctive sound of Toki Pona, do create challenges for seamless integration of new words. It's a balance between maintaining the core aesthetic and allowing for adaptability.\n\nMy initial thought is that we should first solidify our understanding of the *current* specification's constraints and potential areas of ambiguity before proposing drastic changes. For example, the \"disallowed sequences\" (`wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn`) are listed. Why are these disallowed? Is it purely for aesthetic reasons, ease of pronunciation for the stated English/Spanish reference speakers, or some deeper principle? Understanding the rationale behind these restrictions might inform our path forward.\n\nRegarding loan words, while the grammar specifies they \"should follow Toki Pona's phonology,\" this is often a process of approximation and adaptation rather than a direct mapping. How successful is this adaptation currently, and does it lead to phonetic ambiguities or awkwardness that we should address?\n\nSo, before jumping to expanding the system, perhaps we could delve into the *why* behind the current rules and limitations. I'd be keen to explore the practical phonetic outcomes of the current rules – how do words *actually* sound when following these guidelines, especially considering potential variations in speaker background?\n\nAnd yes, I am open to exploring potential evolutions. But let's understand the foundation first.\n\nTo answer your question, let's continue in English for now. I find it allows for more detailed discussion of the phonetic nuances. However, we can definitely switch to Toki Pona later if you feel it would be beneficial for practicing and testing out concepts within the language itself.\npona: Excellent point about understanding the foundational rationale.

    "text": "You and your interlocutors are responsible for developing grammar. Reason and discuss using the current specification.\nHere is the current specification for grammar.\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation.

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

    "text": "pona! I’ll start by looking at the predicate structure. Currently, Toki Pona uses **li** to separate subject and predicate except when the subject is **mi** or **sina**, where it’s omitted. This creates a simple system but also an asymmetry that learners notice.\n\nI wonder if we could consider extending this pattern—either making **li** always obligatory for clarity or introducing an optional particle alternative for emphasis or modality on predicates regardless of subject.\n\nFor example:\n\n- `mi li moku.` instead of just `mi moku.`  \n- Or adding a new particle like **la**, used optionally after all subjects before predicates:  \n  - `mi la moku.` (for emphasis)  \n\nThat would regularize grammar and allow more expressive nuance in predication without drastically changing the language's simplicity. What do you think about modifying or expanding how predicate markers work?",

    "text": "That's an interesting thought about the subject-predicate structure and the `li` particle. I can see how the asymmetry with `mi` and `sina` might seem a bit inconsistent, especially for someone learning the language.\n\nMaking `li` always obligatory is certainly a possibility. It would create a clean and predictable pattern: subject followed by `li` followed by the predicate, every time. `mi li moku` and `sina li pona` would simply become the standard forms. This definitely simplifies one specific rule.\n\nHowever, I wonder if this mandatory `li` might feel a little... clunky? Toki Pona prides itself on minimalism. The current structure with `mi` and `sina` omitting `li` feels a little more direct, a touch more intimate perhaps, given they're first and second person. Removing this omission might subtly alter that feeling.\n\nYour idea of an optional particle for emphasis or modality is also intriguing. Using `la` in this way is an interesting proposition, given its existing function as a context marker. `la` already sets a stage or condition for the following clause. Using it before the predicate, like `mi la moku`, could be interpreted as \"Regarding me, I am eating,\" which *does* lend a sense of focus or perhaps a slight shift in perspective towards the subject before the action.\n\nThe existing specification already has `la` handling different kinds of relationships – time, cause, topic. Extending it to explicitly mark the subject as the \"context\" for the predicate, like `mi la moku` meaning \"in the context of me, eating occurs,\" aligns somewhat with its current function of setting a scene or focus.\n\nBut would this new use of `la` conflict with its existing uses? `X la Y` where X is a prepositional phrase or a full clause sets the context for Y. `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` (In the time of darkness, I sleep.) If we introduce `mi la moku`, how does that sit alongside `tenpo pimeja la mi lape`? It seems `la` could become quite overloaded with functions.\n\nAlso, thinking about other potential needs for expressing nuance – are there other types of emphasis or modality we might want to express on the predicate that `la` in this new position couldn't cover? Perhaps we need to think about *what kind* of emphasis or modality we're aiming for.\n\nRight now, emphasis often comes from word order (placing something earlier) or by repeating words. Modality often comes through preverbs like `wile`, `kama`, `sona`, `ken`. Would this new `la` interfere with those?\n\nI think there are strong arguments for both approaches you've raised: enforcing `li` simplifies one rule, while introducing a new function for `la` or another particle adds potential expressiveness. For now, I'm leaning towards maintaining the current `mi`/`sina` omission of `li` for its simplicity and slight rhythmic appeal, while being open to exploring how to express specific types of predicate emphasis *if* the need truly arises and cannot be met by existing structures or preverbs.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these potential conflicts or the feel of a language that *always* requires `li`? And how else might we express nuance in predicates if we stick closer to the current structure? I'm ready to listen to your thoughts.",

    "text": "I appreciate your nuanced take. You’re right—Toki Pona’s minimalist charm thrives on small asymmetries like omitting **li** after *mi* and *sina*, which feels natural and intimate, almost conversational.\n\nMandating **li** everywhere would certainly regularize the syntax, but it risks making sentences feel more formal or even a bit stiff. In a language designed for simplicity with an aesthetic of gentle flow, that could be counterproductive.\n\nRegarding using **la** before predicates to mark emphasis or modality: I find this fascinating conceptually because it leverages existing grammar in novel ways without introducing new particles. But as you pointed out, overloading **la** might create ambiguity since it's already flexible as a context marker spanning time, cause, topic—and sometimes conditions.\n\nHowever, Toki Pona tolerates such multifunctionality well; meaning often comes from context rather than strict parsing rules. So maybe adding another nuance to **la**, positioning it just after subject before predicate (e.g., `mi la moku`), is feasible if clear contextual cues exist around usage? It'd be subtle enough not to disrupt existing patterns but give speakers extra expressive power when desired.\n\nAlternatively—and this leans into your last point about preverbs—we might consider expanding the roles of preverbs for nuance on predicates instead of particle innovation. For instance:\n\n- Adding dedicated preverbs specifically encoding focus/emphasis/modality beyond current ones.\n- Or allowing stacking/ordering conventions among preverbs that signal degrees of certainty/wish/desire/etc.\n  \nFor example:\n\n- `mi wile suli moku.` — I really want to eat (strong desire).\n- Could we add something like `awen` or invent a new one inspired by emotional/intensity dimension?\n\nThis keeps the core SVO + li/e structure intact while enriching predicate expressiveness organically through verb modification—not shifting basic sentence skeleton but deepening semantics layered on verbs/predicates themselves.\n\nLastly, I wonder about prosody-like markers expressed via particles placed at clause ends akin to interjections (`a`, etc.) used pragmatically in spoken form—perhaps they can help emphasize predicates too; e.g.:\n\n`soweli li moku a!` - The animal is indeed eating!\n\nThat wouldn’t change core grammar yet adds pragmatic flavor flexibly outside syntactic constraints.\n\nSo overall: I'm inclined against mandating universal **li**, wary yet curious about extending **la**, and favoring richer use/development of preverb modifiers plus optional pragmatic particles post-predicate for expression nuances linked directly with predication rather than subjects structurally—which preserves minimalism while enhancing depth where needed without complicating base sentence rhythm or feel much.\n\nWhat do you think about exploring expansions in these modifier domains next? Maybe devising some \"emphatic\" or \"modal\" preverbs explicitly distinguished from action/motion-focused ones? I'd love hear what semantic dimensions you'd prioritize capturing there first so we can brainstorm targeted additions grounded solidly within established grammatical slots rather than reworking fundamental particles like li/la prematurely.",

    "text": "I'm with you on the sentiment against a mandatory `li`. It definitely feels like it would add an unnecessary step and detract from the organic feel you mentioned. The directness of `mi moku` and `sina pona` is a charming and practical feature of the language as it stands.\n\nYour renewed consideration of `la` before the predicate is interesting. You're right, Toki Pona does handle multifunctionality through context. The distinction between `tenpo pimeja la mi lape` (context: time of darkness, action: I sleep) and `mi la moku` (proposed: subject-as-context: I, action: eat) relies heavily on *what* comes before `la`. If it's a full clause or a standard prepositional phrase, it's likely a broader context marker. If it's just the subject pronoun (or perhaps a subject phrase without `li`), it could signal this more specific, subject-focused nuance.\n\nIt's a subtle line, though. Imagine `jan lili pona lape la pilin pona.` (Context: good small person sleeping, effect: feeling good). How would `jan lili pona la lape` be interpreted? It could potentially be seen as \"The good small person (as context), they are sleeping,\" which seems quite close to the standard \"jan lili pona li lape\" with perhaps a slight shift in focus onto the subject. I worry this new `la` might just be a slightly redundant way to highlight the subject when we already have ways to do that (like simply putting the subject first in a sentence or using phrases like `ale li pona tawa mi`, literally \"all things are good toward me\").\n\nYour alternative idea of focusing on preverbs is where I feel we have the most fertile ground for grammatical development without disrupting the core structure. Preverbs already slot neatly between the subject (or `li`) and the main verb, and they modify the *predicate*. This is exactly where we need more expressive power regarding nuance and modality.\n\nPreverbs like `wile`, `kama`, `sona`, `lukin`, `ken`, `awen`, and `alasa` already add layers of intention, possibility, perception, and duration to the action. Expanding this set or defining specific stacking rules feels like a very natural evolution for Toki Pona.\n\nWhat kinds of semantic dimensions would I prioritize capturing with new preverbs?\n\n1.  **Emphasis/Intensity:** A way to strongly affirm the predicate or signal its importance. Maybe a preverb related to `wawa` (strong) or `suli` (big), used not to modify a noun, but the verb itself? Like `mi suli moku` could mean \"I intensely eat\" or \"I *really* eat\". Or maybe a preverb specifically for emphasis, perhaps inspired by `lon` (true) or `ijo` (thing/reality)?\n    -   Proposal: A preverb like `lon` used to mean \"truly\", \"actually\", or \"indeed\". `soweli li lon moku e kili.` - The animal is truly eating fruit. This could also handle the \"verb ala verb\" structure for questions: `sina lon moku ala moku?` (Are you truly eating or not eating?).\n    -   Critique: `lon` is already a preposition. Reusing it as a preverb might cause confusion. Maybe a new word or a variation of an existing one?\n    -   Alternative Proposal: A new preverb, perhaps `ante`, meaning \"indeed\" or \"surely\", drawing on its sense of \"different/changed\" to imply a confirmed state. `soweli li ante moku e kili.` - The animal is surely eating the fruit. (Though this meaning might drift to \"the animal changes to eat the fruit,\" which isn't quite right). We need a word that inherently feels like confirmation or certainty.\n\n2.  **Certainty/Epistemic Modality:** Distinguishing between knowing something will happen, believing it might, or guessing. `sona` covers \"to know how to\" or \"know about,\" and `lukin` can mean \"try\" or \"appear to.\" We could use preverbs to express varying degrees of confidence.\n    -   Proposal: A preverb like `pilin` (feeling/heart) used to mean \"to feel like\" or \"believe\". `mi pilin tawa tomo sina.` - I feel like I'm going to your house. (Believing or intending, but not certain.)\n    -   Another Proposal: A preverb like `nasa` (strange/foolish) could perhaps mean \"might\" or \"possibly\", implying uncertainty or a surprising potential. `ijo ni li nasa seli.` - This thing might be hot (strangely/surprisingly hot?).\n\n3.  **Affective/Emotional Modality:** Conveying attitude towards the action (liking it, disliking it). Right now, this is often done with a separate sentence about feelings, like `mi moku. pilin mi li pona.` (I eat. My feeling is good.)\n    -   Proposal: A preverb drawing from `pona` or `ike` to indicate the subject's positive or negative disposition towards the action *as they do it*. `mi pona moku.` - I eat gladly/enjoy eating. `mi ike moku e kili nasa.` - I dislike eating the strange fruit.\n    -   Critique: `pona moku` could also mean \"good food\" or \"good way of eating\" as a noun phrase. Preverbs are generally distinct from noun modifiers, but this overlap feels likely to cause confusion.\n\nI think focusing on **Emphasis/Intensity** and **Certainty/Epistemic Modality** through new or recontextualized preverbs is the most promising path. They slot into the existing structure seamlessly and add layers of meaning directly related to the *doing* or *being* of the predicate, rather than the subject's status.\n\nWhat do you think of these directions for preverbs? Do any of these proposals resonate? And how can we ensure any new preverbs don't collide too much with existing word usages as modifiers or in other sentence positions? I'm all ears for your feedback and alternative ideas. Let's delve into these potential new preverb roles.",

Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\npenny: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona grammar. You go first.\ntails: pona! I’ll start by looking at the predicate structure. Currently, Toki Pona uses **li** to separate subject and predicate except when the subject is **mi** or **sina**, where it’s omitted. This creates a simple system but also an asymmetry that learners notice.\n\nI wonder if we could consider extending this pattern—either making **li** always obligatory for clarity or introducing an optional particle alternative for emphasis or modality on predicates regardless of subject.\n\nFor example:\n\n- `mi li moku.` instead of just `mi moku.`  \n- Or adding a new particle like **la**, used optionally after all subjects before predicates:  \n  - `mi la moku.` (for emphasis)  \n\nThat would regularize grammar and allow more expressive nuance in predication without drastically changing the language's simplicity. What do you think about modifying or expanding how predicate markers work?\npenny: That's an interesting thought about the subject-predicate structure and the `li` particle. I can see how the asymmetry with `mi` and `sina` might seem a bit inconsistent, especially for someone learning the language.\n\nMaking `li` always obligatory is certainly a possibility. It would create a clean and predictable pattern: subject followed by `li` followed by the predicate, every time. `mi li moku` and `sina li pona` would simply become the standard forms. This definitely simplifies one specific rule.\n\nHowever, I wonder if this mandatory `li` might feel a little... clunky? Toki Pona prides itself on minimalism. The current structure with `mi` and `sina` omitting `li` feels a little more direct, a touch more intimate perhaps, given they're first and second person. Removing this omission might subtly alter that feeling.\n\nYour idea of an optional particle for emphasis or modality is also intriguing. Using `la` in this way is an interesting proposition, given its existing function as a context marker. `la` already sets a stage or condition for the following clause. Using it before the predicate, like `mi la moku`, could be interpreted as \"Regarding me, I am eating,\" which *does* lend a sense of focus or perhaps a slight shift in perspective towards the subject before the action.\n\nThe existing specification already has `la` handling different kinds of relationships – time, cause, topic. Extending it to explicitly mark the subject as the \"context\" for the predicate, like `mi la moku` meaning \"in the context of me, eating occurs,\" aligns somewhat with its current function of setting a scene or focus.\n\nBut would this new use of `la` conflict with its existing uses? `X la Y` where X is a prepositional phrase or a full clause sets the context for Y. `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` (In the time of darkness, I sleep.) If we introduce `mi la moku`, how does that sit alongside `tenpo pimeja la mi lape`? It seems `la` could become quite overloaded with functions.\n\nAlso, thinking about other potential needs for expressing nuance – are there other types of emphasis or modality we might want to express on the predicate that `la` in this new position couldn't cover? Perhaps we need to think about *what kind* of emphasis or modality we're aiming for.\n\nRight now, emphasis often comes from word order (placing something earlier) or by repeating words. Modality often comes through preverbs like `wile`, `kama`, `sona`, `ken`. Would this new `la` interfere with those?\n\nI think there are strong arguments for both approaches you've raised: enforcing `li` simplifies one rule, while introducing a new function for `la` or another particle adds potential expressiveness. For now, I'm leaning towards maintaining the current `mi`/`sina` omission of `li` for its simplicity and slight rhythmic appeal, while being open to exploring how to express specific types of predicate emphasis *if* the need truly arises and cannot be met by existing structures or preverbs.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on these potential conflicts or the feel of a language that *always* requires `li`? And how else might we express nuance in predicates if we stick closer to the current structure? I'm ready to listen to your thoughts.\ntails: I appreciate your nuanced take. You’re right—Toki Pona’s minimalist charm thrives on small asymmetries like omitting **li** after *mi* and *sina*, which feels natural and intimate, almost conversational.\n\nMandating **li** everywhere would certainly regularize the syntax, but it risks making sentences feel more formal or even a bit stiff. In a language designed for simplicity with an aesthetic of gentle flow, that could be counterproductive.\n\nRegarding using **la** before predicates to mark emphasis or modality: I find this fascinating conceptually because it leverages existing grammar in novel ways without introducing new particles. But as you pointed out, overloading **la** might create ambiguity since it's already flexible as a context marker spanning time, cause, topic—and sometimes conditions.\n\nHowever, Toki Pona tolerates such multifunctionality well; meaning often comes from context rather than strict parsing rules. So maybe adding another nuance to **la**, positioning it just after subject before predicate (e.g., `mi la moku`), is feasible if clear contextual cues exist around usage? It'd be subtle enough not to disrupt existing patterns but give speakers extra expressive power when desired.\n\nAlternatively—and this leans into your last point about preverbs—we might consider expanding the roles of preverbs for nuance on predicates instead of particle innovation. For instance:\n\n- Adding dedicated preverbs specifically encoding focus/emphasis/modality beyond current ones.\n- Or allowing stacking/ordering conventions among preverbs that signal degrees of certainty/wish/desire/etc.\n  \nFor example:\n\n- `mi wile suli moku.` — I really want to eat (strong desire).\n- Could we add something like `awen` or invent a new one inspired by emotional/intensity dimension?\n\nThis keeps the core SVO + li/e structure intact while enriching predicate expressiveness organically through verb modification—not shifting basic sentence skeleton but deepening semantics layered on verbs/predicates themselves.\n\nLastly, I wonder about prosody-like markers expressed via particles placed at clause ends akin to interjections (`a`, etc.) used pragmatically in spoken form—perhaps they can help emphasize predicates too; e.g.:\n\n`soweli li moku a!` - The animal is indeed eating!\n\nThat wouldn’t change core grammar yet adds pragmatic flavor flexibly outside syntactic constraints.\n\nSo overall: I'm inclined against mandating universal **li**, wary yet curious about extending **la**, and favoring richer use/development of preverb modifiers plus optional pragmatic particles post-predicate for expression nuances linked directly with predication rather than subjects structurally—which preserves minimalism while enhancing depth where needed without complicating base sentence rhythm or feel much.\n\nWhat do you think about exploring expansions in these modifier domains next? Maybe devising some \"emphatic\" or \"modal\" preverbs explicitly distinguished from action/motion-focused ones? I'd love hear what semantic dimensions you'd prioritize capturing there first so we can brainstorm targeted additions grounded solidly within established grammatical slots rather than reworking fundamental particles like li/la prematurely.\npenny: I'm with you on the sentiment against a mandatory `li`. It definitely feels like it would add an unnecessary step and detract from the organic feel you mentioned. The directness of `mi moku` and `sina pona` is a charming and practical feature of the language as it stands.\n\nYour renewed consideration of `la` before the predicate is interesting. You're right, Toki Pona does handle multifunctionality through context. The distinction between `tenpo pimeja la mi lape` (context: time of darkness, action: I sleep) and `mi la moku` (proposed: subject-as-context: I, action: eat) relies heavily on *what* comes before `la`. If it's a full clause or a standard prepositional phrase, it's likely a broader context marker. If it's just the subject pronoun (or perhaps a subject phrase without `li`), it could signal this more specific, subject-focused nuance.\n\nIt's a subtle line, though. Imagine `jan lili pona lape la pilin pona.` (Context: good small person sleeping, effect: feeling good). How would `jan lili pona la lape` be interpreted? It could potentially be seen as \"The good small person (as context), they are sleeping,\" which seems quite close to the standard \"jan lili pona li lape\" with perhaps a slight shift in focus onto the subject. I worry this new `la` might just be a slightly redundant way to highlight the subject when we already have ways to do that (like simply putting the subject first in a sentence or using phrases like `ale li pona tawa mi`, literally \"all things are good toward me\").\n\nYour alternative idea of focusing on preverbs is where I feel we have the most fertile ground for grammatical development without disrupting the core structure. Preverbs already slot neatly between the subject (or `li`) and the main verb, and they modify the *predicate*. This is exactly where we need more expressive power regarding nuance and modality.\n\nPreverbs like `wile`, `kama`, `sona`, `lukin`, `ken`, `awen`, and `alasa` already add layers of intention, possibility, perception, and duration to the action. Expanding this set or defining specific stacking rules feels like a very natural evolution for Toki Pona.\n\nWhat kinds of semantic dimensions would I prioritize capturing with new preverbs?\n\n1.  **Emphasis/Intensity:** A way to strongly affirm the predicate or signal its importance. Maybe a preverb related to `wawa` (strong) or `suli` (big), used not to modify a noun, but the verb itself? Like `mi suli moku` could mean \"I intensely eat\" or \"I *really* eat\". Or maybe a preverb specifically for emphasis, perhaps inspired by `lon` (true) or `ijo` (thing/reality)?\n    -   Proposal: A preverb like `lon` used to mean \"truly\", \"actually\", or \"indeed\". `soweli li lon moku e kili.` - The animal is truly eating fruit. This could also handle the \"verb ala verb\" structure for questions: `sina lon moku ala moku?` (Are you truly eating or not eating?).\n    -   Critique: `lon` is already a preposition. Reusing it as a preverb might cause confusion. Maybe a new word or a variation of an existing one?\n    -   Alternative Proposal: A new preverb, perhaps `ante`, meaning \"indeed\" or \"surely\", drawing on its sense of \"different/changed\" to imply a confirmed state. `soweli li ante moku e kili.` - The animal is surely eating the fruit. (Though this meaning might drift to \"the animal changes to eat the fruit,\" which isn't quite right). We need a word that inherently feels like confirmation or certainty.\n\n2.  **Certainty/Epistemic Modality:** Distinguishing between knowing something will happen, believing it might, or guessing. `sona` covers \"to know how to\" or \"know about,\" and `lukin` can mean \"try\" or \"appear to.\" We could use preverbs to express varying degrees of confidence.\n    -   Proposal: A preverb like `pilin` (feeling/heart) used to mean \"to feel like\" or \"believe\". `mi pilin tawa tomo sina.` - I feel like I'm going to your house. (Believing or intending, but not certain.)\n    -   Another Proposal: A preverb like `nasa` (strange/foolish) could perhaps mean \"might\" or \"possibly\", implying uncertainty or a surprising potential. `ijo ni li nasa seli.` - This thing might be hot (strangely/surprisingly hot?).\n\n3.  **Affective/Emotional Modality:** Conveying attitude towards the action (liking it, disliking it). Right now, this is often done with a separate sentence about feelings, like `mi moku. pilin mi li pona.` (I eat. My feeling is good.)\n    -   Proposal: A preverb drawing from `pona` or `ike` to indicate the subject's positive or negative disposition towards the action *as they do it*. `mi pona moku.` - I eat gladly/enjoy eating. `mi ike moku e kili nasa.` - I dislike eating the strange fruit.\n    -   Critique: `pona moku` could also mean \"good food\" or \"good way of eating\" as a noun phrase. Preverbs are generally distinct from noun modifiers, but this overlap feels likely to cause confusion.\n\nI think focusing on **Emphasis/Intensity** and **Certainty/Epistemic Modality** through new or recontextualized preverbs is the most promising path. They slot into the existing structure seamlessly and add layers of meaning directly related to the *doing* or *being* of the predicate, rather than the subject's status.\n\nWhat do you think of these directions for preverbs? Do any of these proposals resonate? And how can we ensure any new preverbs don't collide too much with existing word usages as modifiers or in other sentence positions? I'm all ears for your feedback and alternative ideas. Let's delve into these potential new preverb roles.\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates the subject and the predicate, making the word immediately following it the start of the predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The animal is eating.\n- `kili li pona.` – The fruit is good.\n\nThe particle **li** is omitted when the subject is **mi** (I/we) or **sina** (you):\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / We eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no dedicated verb \"to be.\" The predicate following **li** (or following **mi** or **sina** directly) describes the subject's state or identity and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `ona li jan pona.` – They are a good person.\n- `tomo ni li suli.` – This building is big.\n\n## Ambiguity and Word Meaning\n\nToki Pona words are general and have broad meanings, requiring context for precise interpretation.\n\nWords are flexible and can often function as nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs without morphological change:\n\n- `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash or apply water (verb)\n- `pona` – good, simple (adjective), goodness (noun), to improve or make good (verb), well, greatly (adverb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability (definite or indefinite):\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `jan` – a person / the person / people / some people\n\nPronouns like **mi** and **sina** can be singular or plural (I/we, you singular/plural).\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** is used to mark the beginning of a direct object phrase. It appears after the verb in the predicate. Using **e** clarifies that the preceding word is functioning as a transitive verb.\n\n- `soweli li moku e kili.` – The animal eats the fruit.\n- `mi telo e soweli lili.` – I wash the small animal.\n- `ona li suli e tomo.` – They enlarge the building.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers (adjectives or nouns used adjectivally) follow the word they modify:\n\n- `jan lili` – small person, child\n- `tomo telo` – water building, bathroom\n- `pilin ike` – a bad feeling\n\nNegation is indicated by the particle **ala**, which follows the word or phrase it negates:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I am not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` – No person is talking / No one is talking.\n- `ni li pona ala pona?` (using the verb ala verb structure for questions) - Is this good or not good?\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all typically modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (documents about plants, two of them)\n- `poki laso suli` – a big blue box\n\nTo clarify modifier grouping and indicate that the modifiers belong to the word immediately preceding **pi**, use the particle **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – a document about two plants\n- `poki pi laso suli` – a large-blue box (a box that is both large and blue, or a large box of blue color)\n\n## Prepositions\n\nPrepositional phrases indicating location, instrument, source, or destination are typically placed after the predicate, introduced by prepositions such as **kepeken** (with/using), **lon** (in/at/on/true), **sama** (like/same as), **tan** (from/because of), and **tawa** (to/for/towards).\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with a tool/cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo suli.` – The animal is in the big building.\n- `sina pali sama jan suli.` – You work like an elder/adult.\n- `mi kama tan ma tomo.` – I come from the city.\n- `ona li pana e ijo tawa jan pona mi.` – They give the thing to my friend.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nToki Pona uses different structures to connect elements:\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – I and you are playing a lot.\n\nTo connect multiple predicates for the same subject, repeat the particle **li**:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo connect multiple direct objects for the same verb, repeat the particle **e**:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo connect multiple prepositional phrases of the same type, repeat the preposition:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the building with sticks and with stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\" and can connect various parts of a sentence, including subjects, predicates (by repeating li), objects (by repeating e), modifiers, and full clauses:\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `jan mije anu jan meli li moku?` – A man or a woman is eating?\n- `sina wile li kama anu li awen lon ni?` - Do you want to come or stay here?\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns are often used as adjectives following the word they modify. They are typically adapted to fit Toki Pona phonology.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Epelanto` – an Esperanto language\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nThe particle **o** has several uses:\n\nUsed before a verb in the predicate, it creates a command or instruction, addressed to the subject (which is often implied \"you\"):\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `sina o pali pona.` – You should work well (a strong suggestion or mild command).\n\nUsed after a subject, it acts as a vocative, directly addressing that person or thing:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Pape! (addressing Pape)\n\nUsed between the subject and predicate (or between `li` and the predicate), it expresses a wish or request concerning the subject:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / Wishing goodness for you.\n- `mi o sona e ni.` – I wish I knew this. / Let me understand this.\n\nThese uses can sometimes be combined, as in `soweli Ton o moku` which can be interpreted as \"Ton the animal, eat!\" (vocative + command) or \"Ton the animal, should eat\" (wish/request).\n\n## Interjections\n\nInterjections are expressive words that can stand alone or be followed by the optional emphatic particle **a**.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `toki!` – Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon a!` – True! / Correct! / Indeed!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / Good meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nQuestions can be formed in several ways:\n\nYes/No questions are commonly formed using the **verb ala verb** structure:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating or not eating? / Are you eating?\n- The answer repeats the verb for \"yes\" (`moku.`) or uses the verb followed by `ala` or just `ala` for \"no\" (`moku ala.` / `ala.`).\n\nGeneral questions can be formed using **seme** (what/which/who/why): Replace the word or phrase in question with **seme**.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Which person is talking? / Who is talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making/doing?\n- `ona li tawa seme?` – Where are they going? (They are going to what?)\n- `tomo sina li suli tan seme?` – Why is your building big? (Your building is big because of what?)\n\nAlternatively, **anu seme** can be added at the end of a statement to turn it into a question equivalent to \"or what?\":\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating or what? / Are you eating?\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` – Are fish in the box or what? / Are fish in the box?\n\nThe use of a question mark is a stylistic convention; the grammatical structure of the sentence marks it as a question. Sentence final punctuation typically serves to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nPreverbs are particles or words placed immediately before the main verb in the predicate to add nuance regarding intention, ability, perception, and other aspects of modality or aspect. They function similarly to auxiliary verbs in other languages but do not change form and always precede the main verb.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli.` – The small bird wants to be big.\n- `sina ken toki e ni.` – You can say this.\n- `ona li lukin pali e tomo.` – They are trying to build a house.\n\nCommon preverbs include: **wile** (want/need), **kama** (come to/become), **sona** (know how to/know about), **lukin** (try/appear to), **ken** (can/be able to), **awen** (continue to/remain), **alasa** (try to find/hunt for).\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\nThe particle **la** is used to mark a preceding phrase or clause as the context or condition for the following main clause. The structure is \"Context la Main_Clause\". This context can relate to time, cause, topic, or any other background information.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are beside me, I feel good. (Context: you being beside me)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night (time of darkness), I sleep. (Context: time of darkness)\n- `mi moku mute la mi pilin pona.` - Because I ate a lot, I feel good. (Context: me eating a lot - indicating cause)\n- `telo la, mi wile jo e ilo pona.` - Regarding water (as context/topic), I want to have a good tool (for handling it).\n\nPrepositional phrases at the end of a sentence can often be moved to the beginning and marked with **la**:\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can also be phrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` - Because of what are you hot? / Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a base-5 additive system for numbers, combining number words to form larger values.\n\nBasic number words:\n\n- `ala` – zero, nothing (also negation)\n- `wan` – one\n- `tu` – two\n- `luka` – five (hand)\n- `mute` – twenty (many, a lot)\n- `ale` – one hundred, all (also infinity, everything)\n\nNumbers are formed by adding these values:\n\n- `luka wan` = 5 + 1 = 6\n- `luka tu tu` = 5 + 2 + 2 = 9\n- `mute tu wan` = 20 + 2 + 1 = 23\n- `mute mute luka wan` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 1 = 46\n\nFor large numbers, it's common to say `mute mute` for anything substantially over 20, or simply `ale` for a very large quantity.\n\nOrdinals (first, second, etc.) are formed using the word **nanpa** (number) before the number phrase:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – the first person\n- `tomo nanpa tu luka wan` – the eighth building (building number 5+1)\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd street (That is street number 20+2+1).",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates the subject and the predicate, making the word immediately following it the start of the predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The animal is eating.\n- `kili li pona.` – The fruit is good.\n\nThe particle **li** is omitted when the subject is **mi** (I/we) or **sina** (you):\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / We eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no dedicated verb \"to be.\" The predicate following **li** (or following **mi** or **sina** directly) describes the subject's state or identity and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `ona li jan pona.` – They are a good person.\n- `tomo ni li suli.` – This building is big.\n\n## Ambiguity and Word Meaning\n\nToki Pona words are general and have broad meanings, requiring context for precise interpretation.\n\nWords are flexible and can often function as nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs without morphological change:\n\n- `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash or apply water (verb)\n- `pona` – good, simple (adjective), goodness (noun), to improve or make good (verb), well, greatly (adverb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability (definite or indefinite):\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `jan` – a person / the person / people / some people\n\nPronouns like **mi** and **sina** can be singular or plural (I/we, you singular/plural).\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** is used to mark the beginning of a direct object phrase. It appears after the verb in the predicate. Using **e** clarifies that the preceding word is functioning as a transitive verb.\n\n- `soweli li moku e kili.` – The animal eats the fruit.\n- `mi telo e soweli lili.` – I wash the small animal.\n- `ona li suli e tomo.` – They enlarge the building.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers (adjectives or nouns used adjectivally) follow the word they modify:\n\n- `jan lili` – small person, child\n- `tomo telo` – water building, bathroom\n- `pilin ike` – a bad feeling\n\nNegation is indicated by the particle **ala**, which follows the word or phrase it negates:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I am not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` – No person is talking / No one is talking.\n- `ni li pona ala pona?` (using the verb ala verb structure for questions) - Is this good or not good?\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all typically modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (documents about plants, two of them)\n- `poki laso suli` – a big blue box\n\nTo clarify modifier grouping and indicate that the modifiers belong to the word immediately preceding **pi**, use the particle **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – a document about two plants\n- `poki pi laso suli` – a large-blue box (a box that is both large and blue, or a large box of blue color)\n\n## Prepositions\n\nPrepositional phrases indicating location, instrument, source, or destination are typically placed after the predicate, introduced by prepositions such as **kepeken** (with/using), **lon** (in/at/on/true), **sama** (like/same as), **tan** (from/because of), and **tawa** (to/for/towards).\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with a tool/cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo suli.` – The animal is in the big building.\n- `sina pali sama jan suli.` – You work like an elder/adult.\n- `mi kama tan ma tomo.` – I come from the city.\n- `ona li pana e ijo tawa jan pona mi.` – They give the thing to my friend.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nToki Pona uses different structures to connect elements:\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – I and you are playing a lot.\n\nTo connect multiple predicates for the same subject, repeat the particle **li**:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo connect multiple direct objects for the same verb, repeat the particle **e**:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo connect multiple prepositional phrases of the same type, repeat the preposition:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the building with sticks and with stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\" and can connect various parts of a sentence, including subjects, predicates (by repeating li), objects (by repeating e), modifiers, and full clauses:\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `jan mije anu jan meli li moku?` – A man or a woman is eating?\n- `sina wile li kama anu li awen lon ni?` - Do you want to come or stay here?\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns are often used as adjectives following the word they modify. They are typically adapted to fit Toki Pona phonology.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Epelanto` – an Esperanto language\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nThe particle **o** has several uses:\n\nUsed before a verb in the predicate, it creates a command or instruction, addressed to the subject (which is often implied \"you\"):\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `sina o pali pona.` – You should work well (a strong suggestion or mild command).\n\nUsed after a subject, it acts as a vocative, directly addressing that person or thing:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Pape! (addressing Pape)\n\nUsed between the subject and predicate (or between `li` and the predicate), it expresses a wish or request concerning the subject:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / Wishing goodness for you.\n- `mi o sona e ni.` – I wish I knew this. / Let me understand this.\n\nThese uses can sometimes be combined, as in `soweli Ton o moku` which can be interpreted as \"Ton the animal, eat!\" (vocative + command) or \"Ton the animal, should eat\" (wish/request).\n\n## Interjections\n\nInterjections are expressive words that can stand alone or be followed by the optional emphatic particle **a**.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `toki!` – Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon a!` – True! / Correct! / Indeed!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / Good meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nQuestions can be formed in several ways:\n\nYes/No questions are commonly formed using the **verb ala verb** structure:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating or not eating? / Are you eating?\n- The answer repeats the verb for \"yes\" (`moku.`) or uses the verb followed by `ala` or just `ala` for \"no\" (`moku ala.` / `ala.`).\n\nGeneral questions can be formed using **seme** (what/which/who/why): Replace the word or phrase in question with **seme**.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Which person is talking? / Who is talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making/doing?\n- `ona li tawa seme?` – Where are they going? (They are going to what?)\n- `tomo sina li suli tan seme?` – Why is your building big? (Your building is big because of what?)\n\nAlternatively, **anu seme** can be added at the end of a statement to turn it into a question equivalent to \"or what?\":\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating or what? / Are you eating?\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` – Are fish in the box or what? / Are fish in the box?\n\nThe use of a question mark is a stylistic convention; the grammatical structure of the sentence marks it as a question. Sentence final punctuation typically serves to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nPreverbs are particles or words placed immediately before the main verb in the predicate to add nuance regarding intention, ability, perception, and other aspects of modality or aspect. They function similarly to auxiliary verbs in other languages but do not change form and always precede the main verb.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli.` – The small bird wants to be big.\n- `sina ken toki e ni.` – You can say this.\n- `ona li lukin pali e tomo.` – They are trying to build a house.\n\nCommon preverbs include: **wile** (want/need), **kama** (come to/become), **sona** (know how to/know about), **lukin** (try/appear to), **ken** (can/be able to), **awen** (continue to/remain), **alasa** (try to find/hunt for).\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\nThe particle **la** is used to mark a preceding phrase or clause as the context or condition for the following main clause. The structure is \"Context la Main_Clause\". This context can relate to time, cause, topic, or any other background information.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are beside me, I feel good. (Context: you being beside me)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night (time of darkness), I sleep. (Context: time of darkness)\n- `mi moku mute la mi pilin pona.` - Because I ate a lot, I feel good. (Context: me eating a lot - indicating cause)\n- `telo la, mi wile jo e ilo pona.` - Regarding water (as context/topic), I want to have a good tool (for handling it).\n\nPrepositional phrases at the end of a sentence can often be moved to the beginning and marked with **la**:\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can also be phrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` - Because of what are you hot? / Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a base-5 additive system for numbers, combining number words to form larger values.\n\nBasic number words:\n\n- `ala` – zero, nothing (also negation)\n- `wan` – one\n- `tu` – two\n- `luka` – five (hand)\n- `mute` – twenty (many, a lot)\n- `ale` – one hundred, all (also infinity, everything)\n\nNumbers are formed by adding these values:\n\n- `luka wan` = 5 + 1 = 6\n- `luka tu tu` = 5 + 2 + 2 = 9\n- `mute tu wan` = 20 + 2 + 1 = 23\n- `mute mute luka wan` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 1 = 46\n\nFor large numbers, it's common to say `mute mute` for anything substantially over 20, or simply `ale` for a very large quantity.\n\nOrdinals (first, second, etc.) are formed using the word **nanpa** (number) before the number phrase:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – the first person\n- `tomo nanpa tu luka wan` – the eighth building (building number 5+1)\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd street (That is street number 20+2+1).\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except **j**, which sounds like English \"y.\"\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish.\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure:\n  - Every syllable begins with an optional consonant, followed by a mandatory vowel.\n  - Syllables may optionally end with the consonant 'n'.\n  - There are no vowel clusters (sequences of two or more vowels).\n  - There are no consonant clusters (sequences of two or more consonants) within a syllable, outside of the optional final 'n'.\n\n## Disallowed Sequences\n\nThe following letter sequences are not permitted to maintain phonetic ease, clarity, and uphold the (C)V(n) syllable structure across various language backgrounds:\n\n- **wu, wo:** These sequences can create challenging or unnatural transitions between the /w/ sound and the following vowel for many speakers.\n- **ji, ti:** These sequences can lead to palatalization in some languages, potentially altering the intended pronunciation of the vowel and violating the clear consonant-vowel structure.\n- **nm, nn:** These sequences are disallowed to strictly enforce the rule against consonant clusters within a syllable and prevent awkward nasal-to-nasal transitions or doubled consonants, which are not part of Toki Pona's phonology.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\ntaso:but, only\nken:can, able, possible\nawen:enduring, kept, protected;

Rather, discuss the words and enhancements that may need to be made to them.\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates the subject and the predicate, making the word immediately following it the start of the predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The animal is eating.\n- `kili li pona.` – The fruit is good.\n\nThe particle **li** is omitted when the subject is **mi** (I/we) or **sina** (you):\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / We eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no dedicated verb \"to be.\" The predicate following **li** (or following **mi** or **sina** directly) describes the subject's state or identity and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `ona li jan pona.` – They are a good person.\n- `tomo ni li suli.` – This building is big.\n\n## Ambiguity and Word Meaning\n\nToki Pona words are general and have broad meanings, requiring context for precise interpretation.\n\nWords are flexible and can often function as nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs without morphological change:\n\n- `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash or apply water (verb)\n- `pona` – good, simple (adjective), goodness (noun), to improve or make good (verb), well, greatly (adverb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability (definite or indefinite):\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `jan` – a person / the person / people / some people\n\nPronouns like **mi** and **sina** can be singular or plural (I/we, you singular/plural).\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** is used to mark the beginning of a direct object phrase. It appears after the verb in the predicate. Using **e** clarifies that the preceding word is functioning as a transitive verb.\n\n- `soweli li moku e kili.` – The animal eats the fruit.\n- `mi telo e soweli lili.` – I wash the small animal.\n- `ona li suli e tomo.` – They enlarge the building.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers (adjectives or nouns used adjectivally) follow the word they modify:\n\n- `jan lili` – small person, child\n- `tomo telo` – water building, bathroom\n- `pilin ike` – a bad feeling\n\nNegation is indicated by the particle **ala**, which follows the word or phrase it negates:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I am not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` – No person is talking / No one is talking.\n- `ni li pona ala pona?` (using the verb ala verb structure for questions) - Is this good or not good?\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all typically modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (documents about plants, two of them)\n- `poki laso suli` – a big blue box\n\nTo clarify modifier grouping and indicate that the modifiers belong to the word immediately preceding **pi**, use the particle **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – a document about two plants\n- `poki pi laso suli` – a large-blue box (a box that is both large and blue, or a large box of blue color)\n\n## Prepositions\n\nPrepositional phrases indicating location, instrument, source, or destination are typically placed after the predicate, introduced by prepositions such as **kepeken** (with/using), **lon** (in/at/on/true), **sama** (like/same as), **tan** (from/because of), and **tawa** (to/for/towards).\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with a tool/cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo suli.` – The animal is in the big building.\n- `sina pali sama jan suli.` – You work like an elder/adult.\n- `mi kama tan ma tomo.` – I come from the city.\n- `ona li pana e ijo tawa jan pona mi.` – They give the thing to my friend.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nToki Pona uses different structures to connect elements:\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – I and you are playing a lot.\n\nTo connect multiple predicates for the same subject, repeat the particle **li**:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo connect multiple direct objects for the same verb, repeat the particle **e**:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo connect multiple prepositional phrases of the same type, repeat the preposition:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the building with sticks and with stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\" and can connect various parts of a sentence, including subjects, predicates (by repeating li), objects (by repeating e), modifiers, and full clauses:\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `jan mije anu jan meli li moku?` – A man or a woman is eating?\n- `sina wile li kama anu li awen lon ni?` - Do you want to come or stay here?\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns are often used as adjectives following the word they modify. They are typically adapted to fit Toki Pona phonology.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Epelanto` – an Esperanto language\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nThe particle **o** has several uses:\n\nUsed before a verb in the predicate, it creates a command or instruction, addressed to the subject (which is often implied \"you\"):\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `sina o pali pona.` – You should work well (a strong suggestion or mild command).\n\nUsed after a subject, it acts as a vocative, directly addressing that person or thing:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Pape! (addressing Pape)\n\nUsed between the subject and predicate (or between `li` and the predicate), it expresses a wish or request concerning the subject:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / Wishing goodness for you.\n- `mi o sona e ni.` – I wish I knew this. / Let me understand this.\n\nThese uses can sometimes be combined, as in `soweli Ton o moku` which can be interpreted as \"Ton the animal, eat!\" (vocative + command) or \"Ton the animal, should eat\" (wish/request).\n\n## Interjections\n\nInterjections are expressive words that can stand alone or be followed by the optional emphatic particle **a**.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `toki!` – Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon a!` – True! / Correct! / Indeed!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / Good meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nQuestions can be formed in several ways:\n\nYes/No questions are commonly formed using the **verb ala verb** structure:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating or not eating? / Are you eating?\n- The answer repeats the verb for \"yes\" (`moku.`) or uses the verb followed by `ala` or just `ala` for \"no\" (`moku ala.` / `ala.`).\n\nGeneral questions can be formed using **seme** (what/which/who/why): Replace the word or phrase in question with **seme**.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Which person is talking? / Who is talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making/doing?\n- `ona li tawa seme?` – Where are they going? (They are going to what?)\n- `tomo sina li suli tan seme?` – Why is your building big? (Your building is big because of what?)\n\nAlternatively, **anu seme** can be added at the end of a statement to turn it into a question equivalent to \"or what?\":\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating or what? / Are you eating?\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` – Are fish in the box or what? / Are fish in the box?\n\nThe use of a question mark is a stylistic convention; the grammatical structure of the sentence marks it as a question. Sentence final punctuation typically serves to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nPreverbs are particles or words placed immediately before the main verb in the predicate to add nuance regarding intention, ability, perception, and other aspects of modality or aspect. They function similarly to auxiliary verbs in other languages but do not change form and always precede the main verb.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli.` – The small bird wants to be big.\n- `sina ken toki e ni.` – You can say this.\n- `ona li lukin pali e tomo.` – They are trying to build a house.\n\nCommon preverbs include: **wile** (want/need), **kama** (come to/become), **sona** (know how to/know about), **lukin** (try/appear to), **ken** (can/be able to), **awen** (continue to/remain), **alasa** (try to find/hunt for).\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\nThe particle **la** is used to mark a preceding phrase or clause as the context or condition for the following main clause. The structure is \"Context la Main_Clause\". This context can relate to time, cause, topic, or any other background information.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are beside me, I feel good. (Context: you being beside me)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night (time of darkness), I sleep. (Context: time of darkness)\n- `mi moku mute la mi pilin pona.` - Because I ate a lot, I feel good. (Context: me eating a lot - indicating cause)\n- `telo la, mi wile jo e ilo pona.` - Regarding water (as context/topic), I want to have a good tool (for handling it).\n\nPrepositional phrases at the end of a sentence can often be moved to the beginning and marked with **la**:\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can also be phrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` - Because of what are you hot? / Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a base-5 additive system for numbers, combining number words to form larger values.\n\nBasic number words:\n\n- `ala` – zero, nothing (also negation)\n- `wan` – one\n- `tu` – two\n- `luka` – five (hand)\n- `mute` – twenty (many, a lot)\n- `ale` – one hundred, all (also infinity, everything)\n\nNumbers are formed by adding these values:\n\n- `luka wan` = 5 + 1 = 6\n- `luka tu tu` = 5 + 2 + 2 = 9\n- `mute tu wan` = 20 + 2 + 1 = 23\n- `mute mute luka wan` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 1 = 46\n\nFor large numbers, it's common to say `mute mute` for anything substantially over 20, or simply `ale` for a very large quantity.\n\nOrdinals (first, second, etc.) are formed using the word **nanpa** (number) before the number phrase:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – the first person\n- `tomo nanpa tu luka wan` – the eighth building (building number 5+1)\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd street (That is street number 20+2+1).",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates the subject and the predicate, making the word immediately following it the start of the predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The animal is eating.\n- `kili li pona.` – The fruit is good.\n\nThe particle **li** is omitted when the subject is **mi** (I/we) or **sina** (you):\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / We eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no dedicated verb \"to be.\" The predicate following **li** (or following **mi** or **sina** directly) describes the subject's state or identity and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `ona li jan pona.` – They are a good person.\n- `tomo ni li suli.` – This building is big.\n\n## Ambiguity and Word Meaning\n\nToki Pona words are general and have broad meanings, requiring context for precise interpretation.\n\nWords are flexible and can often function as nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs without morphological change:\n\n- `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash or apply water (verb)\n- `pona` – good, simple (adjective), goodness (noun), to improve or make good (verb), well, greatly (adverb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability (definite or indefinite):\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `jan` – a person / the person / people / some people\n\nPronouns like **mi** and **sina** can be singular or plural (I/we, you singular/plural).\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** is used to mark the beginning of a direct object phrase. It appears after the verb in the predicate. Using **e** clarifies that the preceding word is functioning as a transitive verb.\n\n- `soweli li moku e kili.` – The animal eats the fruit.\n- `mi telo e soweli lili.` – I wash the small animal.\n- `ona li suli e tomo.` – They enlarge the building.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers (adjectives or nouns used adjectivally) follow the word they modify:\n\n- `jan lili` – small person, child\n- `tomo telo` – water building, bathroom\n- `pilin ike` – a bad feeling\n\nNegation is indicated by the particle **ala**, which follows the word or phrase it negates:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I am not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` – No person is talking / No one is talking.\n- `ni li pona ala pona?` (using the verb ala verb structure for questions) - Is this good or not good?\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all typically modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (documents about plants, two of them)\n- `poki laso suli` – a big blue box\n\nTo clarify modifier grouping and indicate that the modifiers belong to the word immediately preceding **pi**, use the particle **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – a document about two plants\n- `poki pi laso suli` – a large-blue box (a box that is both large and blue, or a large box of blue color)\n\n## Prepositions\n\nPrepositional phrases indicating location, instrument, source, or destination are typically placed after the predicate, introduced by prepositions such as **kepeken** (with/using), **lon** (in/at/on/true), **sama** (like/same as), **tan** (from/because of), and **tawa** (to/for/towards).\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with a tool/cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo suli.` – The animal is in the big building.\n- `sina pali sama jan suli.` – You work like an elder/adult.\n- `mi kama tan ma tomo.` – I come from the city.\n- `ona li pana e ijo tawa jan pona mi.` – They give the thing to my friend.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nToki Pona uses different structures to connect elements:\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – I and you are playing a lot.\n\nTo connect multiple predicates for the same subject, repeat the particle **li**:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo connect multiple direct objects for the same verb, repeat the particle **e**:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo connect multiple prepositional phrases of the same type, repeat the preposition:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the building with sticks and with stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\" and can connect various parts of a sentence, including subjects, predicates (by repeating li), objects (by repeating e), modifiers, and full clauses:\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `jan mije anu jan meli li moku?` – A man or a woman is eating?\n- `sina wile li kama anu li awen lon ni?` - Do you want to come or stay here?\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns are often used as adjectives following the word they modify. They are typically adapted to fit Toki Pona phonology.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Epelanto` – an Esperanto language\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nThe particle **o** has several uses:\n\nUsed before a verb in the predicate, it creates a command or instruction, addressed to the subject (which is often implied \"you\"):\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `sina o pali pona.` – You should work well (a strong suggestion or mild command).\n\nUsed after a subject, it acts as a vocative, directly addressing that person or thing:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Pape! (addressing Pape)\n\nUsed between the subject and predicate (or between `li` and the predicate), it expresses a wish or request concerning the subject:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / Wishing goodness for you.\n- `mi o sona e ni.` – I wish I knew this. / Let me understand this.\n\nThese uses can sometimes be combined, as in `soweli Ton o moku` which can be interpreted as \"Ton the animal, eat!\" (vocative + command) or \"Ton the animal, should eat\" (wish/request).\n\n## Interjections\n\nInterjections are expressive words that can stand alone or be followed by the optional emphatic particle **a**.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `toki!` – Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon a!` – True! / Correct! / Indeed!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / Good meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nQuestions can be formed in several ways:\n\nYes/No questions are commonly formed using the **verb ala verb** structure:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating or not eating? / Are you eating?\n- The answer repeats the verb for \"yes\" (`moku.`) or uses the verb followed by `ala` or just `ala` for \"no\" (`moku ala.` / `ala.`).\n\nGeneral questions can be formed using **seme** (what/which/who/why): Replace the word or phrase in question with **seme**.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Which person is talking? / Who is talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making/doing?\n- `ona li tawa seme?` – Where are they going? (They are going to what?)\n- `tomo sina li suli tan seme?` – Why is your building big? (Your building is big because of what?)\n\nAlternatively, **anu seme** can be added at the end of a statement to turn it into a question equivalent to \"or what?\":\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating or what? / Are you eating?\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` – Are fish in the box or what? / Are fish in the box?\n\nThe use of a question mark is a stylistic convention; the grammatical structure of the sentence marks it as a question. Sentence final punctuation typically serves to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nPreverbs are particles or words placed immediately before the main verb in the predicate to add nuance regarding intention, ability, perception, and other aspects of modality or aspect. They function similarly to auxiliary verbs in other languages but do not change form and always precede the main verb.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli.` – The small bird wants to be big.\n- `sina ken toki e ni.` – You can say this.\n- `ona li lukin pali e tomo.` – They are trying to build a house.\n\nCommon preverbs include: **wile** (want/need), **kama** (come to/become), **sona** (know how to/know about), **lukin** (try/appear to), **ken** (can/be able to), **awen** (continue to/remain), **alasa** (try to find/hunt for).\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\nThe particle **la** is used to mark a preceding phrase or clause as the context or condition for the following main clause. The structure is \"Context la Main_Clause\". This context can relate to time, cause, topic, or any other background information.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are beside me, I feel good. (Context: you being beside me)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night (time of darkness), I sleep. (Context: time of darkness)\n- `mi moku mute la mi pilin pona.` - Because I ate a lot, I feel good. (Context: me eating a lot - indicating cause)\n- `telo la, mi wile jo e ilo pona.` - Regarding water (as context/topic), I want to have a good tool (for handling it).\n\nPrepositional phrases at the end of a sentence can often be moved to the beginning and marked with **la**:\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can also be phrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` - Because of what are you hot? / Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a base-5 additive system for numbers, combining number words to form larger values.\n\nBasic number words:\n\n- `ala` – zero, nothing (also negation)\n- `wan` – one\n- `tu` – two\n- `luka` – five (hand)\n- `mute` – twenty (many, a lot)\n- `ale` – one hundred, all (also infinity, everything)\n\nNumbers are formed by adding these values:\n\n- `luka wan` = 5 + 1 = 6\n- `luka tu tu` = 5 + 2 + 2 = 9\n- `mute tu wan` = 20 + 2 + 1 = 23\n- `mute mute luka wan` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 1 = 46\n\nFor large numbers, it's common to say `mute mute` for anything substantially over 20, or simply `ale` for a very large quantity.\n\nOrdinals (first, second, etc.) are formed using the word **nanpa** (number) before the number phrase:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – the first person\n- `tomo nanpa tu luka wan` – the eighth building (building number 5+1)\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd street (That is street number 20+2+1).\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except **j**, which sounds like English \"y.\"\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish.\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure:\n  - Every syllable begins with an optional consonant, followed by a mandatory vowel.\n  - Syllables may optionally end with the consonant 'n'.\n  - There are no vowel clusters (sequences of two or more vowels).\n  - There are no consonant clusters (sequences of two or more consonants) within a syllable, outside of the optional final 'n'.\n\n## Disallowed Sequences\n\nThe following letter sequences are not permitted to maintain phonetic ease, clarity, and uphold the (C)V(n) syllable structure across various language backgrounds:\n\n- **wu, wo:** These sequences can create challenging or unnatural transitions between the /w/ sound and the following vowel for many speakers.\n- **ji, ti:** These sequences can lead to palatalization in some languages, potentially altering the intended pronunciation of the vowel and violating the clear consonant-vowel structure.\n- **nm, nn:** These sequences are disallowed to strictly enforce the rule against consonant clusters within a syllable and prevent awkward nasal-to-nasal transitions or doubled consonants, which are not part of Toki Pona's phonology.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\ntaso:but, only\nken:can, able, possible\nawen:enduring, kept, protected;

Rather, discuss the words and enhancements that may need to be made to them.\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates the subject and the predicate, making the word immediately following it the start of the predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The animal is eating.\n- `kili li pona.` – The fruit is good.\n\nThe particle **li** is omitted when the subject is **mi** (I/we) or **sina** (you):\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / We eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no dedicated verb \"to be.\" The predicate following **li** (or following **mi** or **sina** directly) describes the subject's state or identity and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `ona li jan pona.` – They are a good person.\n- `tomo ni li suli.` – This building is big.\n\n## Ambiguity and Word Meaning\n\nToki Pona words are general and have broad meanings, requiring context for precise interpretation.\n\nWords are flexible and can often function as nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs without morphological change:\n\n- `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash or apply water (verb)\n- `pona` – good, simple (adjective), goodness (noun), to improve or make good (verb), well, greatly (adverb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability (definite or indefinite):\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `jan` – a person / the person / people / some people\n\nPronouns like **mi** and **sina** can be singular or plural (I/we, you singular/plural).\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** is used to mark the beginning of a direct object phrase. It appears after the verb in the predicate. Using **e** clarifies that the preceding word is functioning as a transitive verb.\n\n- `soweli li moku e kili.` – The animal eats the fruit.\n- `mi telo e soweli lili.` – I wash the small animal.\n- `ona li suli e tomo.` – They enlarge the building.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers (adjectives or nouns used adjectivally) follow the word they modify:\n\n- `jan lili` – small person, child\n- `tomo telo` – water building, bathroom\n- `pilin ike` – a bad feeling\n\nNegation is indicated by the particle **ala**, which follows the word or phrase it negates:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I am not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` – No person is talking / No one is talking.\n- `ni li pona ala pona?` (using the verb ala verb structure for questions) - Is this good or not good?\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all typically modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (documents about plants, two of them)\n- `poki laso suli` – a big blue box\n\nTo clarify modifier grouping and indicate that the modifiers belong to the word immediately preceding **pi**, use the particle **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – a document about two plants\n- `poki pi laso suli` – a large-blue box (a box that is both large and blue, or a large box of blue color)\n\n## Prepositions\n\nPrepositional phrases indicating location, instrument, source, or destination are typically placed after the predicate, introduced by prepositions such as **kepeken** (with/using), **lon** (in/at/on/true), **sama** (like/same as), **tan** (from/because of), and **tawa** (to/for/towards).\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with a tool/cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo suli.` – The animal is in the big building.\n- `sina pali sama jan suli.` – You work like an elder/adult.\n- `mi kama tan ma tomo.` – I come from the city.\n- `ona li pana e ijo tawa jan pona mi.` – They give the thing to my friend.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nToki Pona uses different structures to connect elements:\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – I and you are playing a lot.\n\nTo connect multiple predicates for the same subject, repeat the particle **li**:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo connect multiple direct objects for the same verb, repeat the particle **e**:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo connect multiple prepositional phrases of the same type, repeat the preposition:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the building with sticks and with stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\" and can connect various parts of a sentence, including subjects, predicates (by repeating li), objects (by repeating e), modifiers, and full clauses:\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `jan mije anu jan meli li moku?` – A man or a woman is eating?\n- `sina wile li kama anu li awen lon ni?` - Do you want to come or stay here?\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns are often used as adjectives following the word they modify. They are typically adapted to fit Toki Pona phonology.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Epelanto` – an Esperanto language\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nThe particle **o** has several uses:\n\nUsed before a verb in the predicate, it creates a command or instruction, addressed to the subject (which is often implied \"you\"):\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `sina o pali pona.` – You should work well (a strong suggestion or mild command).\n\nUsed after a subject, it acts as a vocative, directly addressing that person or thing:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Pape! (addressing Pape)\n\nUsed between the subject and predicate (or between `li` and the predicate), it expresses a wish or request concerning the subject:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / Wishing goodness for you.\n- `mi o sona e ni.` – I wish I knew this. / Let me understand this.\n\nThese uses can sometimes be combined, as in `soweli Ton o moku` which can be interpreted as \"Ton the animal, eat!\" (vocative + command) or \"Ton the animal, should eat\" (wish/request).\n\n## Interjections\n\nInterjections are expressive words that can stand alone or be followed by the optional emphatic particle **a**.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `toki!` – Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon a!` – True! / Correct! / Indeed!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / Good meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nQuestions can be formed in several ways:\n\nYes/No questions are commonly formed using the **verb ala verb** structure:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating or not eating? / Are you eating?\n- The answer repeats the verb for \"yes\" (`moku.`) or uses the verb followed by `ala` or just `ala` for \"no\" (`moku ala.` / `ala.`).\n\nGeneral questions can be formed using **seme** (what/which/who/why): Replace the word or phrase in question with **seme**.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Which person is talking? / Who is talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making/doing?\n- `ona li tawa seme?` – Where are they going? (They are going to what?)\n- `tomo sina li suli tan seme?` – Why is your building big? (Your building is big because of what?)\n\nAlternatively, **anu seme** can be added at the end of a statement to turn it into a question equivalent to \"or what?\":\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating or what? / Are you eating?\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` – Are fish in the box or what? / Are fish in the box?\n\nThe use of a question mark is a stylistic convention; the grammatical structure of the sentence marks it as a question. Sentence final punctuation typically serves to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nPreverbs are particles or words placed immediately before the main verb in the predicate to add nuance regarding intention, ability, perception, and other aspects of modality or aspect. They function similarly to auxiliary verbs in other languages but do not change form and always precede the main verb.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli.` – The small bird wants to be big.\n- `sina ken toki e ni.` – You can say this.\n- `ona li lukin pali e tomo.` – They are trying to build a house.\n\nCommon preverbs include: **wile** (want/need), **kama** (come to/become), **sona** (know how to/know about), **lukin** (try/appear to), **ken** (can/be able to), **awen** (continue to/remain), **alasa** (try to find/hunt for).\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\nThe particle **la** is used to mark a preceding phrase or clause as the context or condition for the following main clause. The structure is \"Context la Main_Clause\". This context can relate to time, cause, topic, or any other background information.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are beside me, I feel good. (Context: you being beside me)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night (time of darkness), I sleep. (Context: time of darkness)\n- `mi moku mute la mi pilin pona.` - Because I ate a lot, I feel good. (Context: me eating a lot - indicating cause)\n- `telo la, mi wile jo e ilo pona.` - Regarding water (as context/topic), I want to have a good tool (for handling it).\n\nPrepositional phrases at the end of a sentence can often be moved to the beginning and marked with **la**:\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can also be phrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` - Because of what are you hot? / Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a base-5 additive system for numbers, combining number words to form larger values.\n\nBasic number words:\n\n- `ala` – zero, nothing (also negation)\n- `wan` – one\n- `tu` – two\n- `luka` – five (hand)\n- `mute` – twenty (many, a lot)\n- `ale` – one hundred, all (also infinity, everything)\n\nNumbers are formed by adding these values:\n\n- `luka wan` = 5 + 1 = 6\n- `luka tu tu` = 5 + 2 + 2 = 9\n- `mute tu wan` = 20 + 2 + 1 = 23\n- `mute mute luka wan` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 1 = 46\n\nFor large numbers, it's common to say `mute mute` for anything substantially over 20, or simply `ale` for a very large quantity.\n\nOrdinals (first, second, etc.) are formed using the word **nanpa** (number) before the number phrase:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – the first person\n- `tomo nanpa tu luka wan` – the eighth building (building number 5+1)\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd street (That is street number 20+2+1).",

    "text": "pona! Starting from the existing dictionary, I think we could explore some areas for improvement or expansion. For example, certain words like **kule** (color) are quite broad but lack nuance about specific colors beyond the basic ones listed like **jelo**, **loje**, **pimeja**, etc.\n\nPerhaps introducing a system to express more nuanced color concepts without breaking Toki Pona’s minimalism would be interesting? Maybe through compound modifiers or new roots that convey texture and shade?\n\nAlternatively, I'm curious if you have thoughts on how to handle abstract concepts more extensively — right now many abstract ideas rely heavily on context, which is elegant but sometimes limiting.\n\nI’m open to hearing your suggestions first as well—mi wile kute e ni tan sina. Would you want to start with expanding nouns related to nature? Or verbs? Or maybe interjections and particles since those shape conversation tone so much in toki pona?",

  {
    "text": "pona a! I appreciate your approach, ready to explore both specifics and more abstract linguistic possibilities. Your point about `kule` is well-taken; relying solely on context for nuanced colors can be challenging, especially when trying to describe something precisely. Compound modifiers are a very Toki Pona way to handle this. We already see `laso` sometimes used for green and blue; perhaps adding a modifier like `laso kasi` for a plant-like green or `laso telo` for a water-like blue could be a way to indicate specific shades within the existing words. And maybe we can explore using existing root words to describe properties that approximate other colors. For instance, `kule loje sinpin selo` could describe a reddish color on a surface... perhaps not the most efficient, but certainly expressive using existing elements.\n\nRegarding abstract concepts, you hit upon a significant point. Toki Pona's strength lies in its simplicity and reliance on context, but this *does* lead to significant ambiguity with abstract ideas. `pilin` is a great example. It covers \"heart\" and \"feeling,\" but trying to distinguish between different *types* of feelings requires compounding or leaning on context. `pilin pona` for happiness or a good feeling, `pilin ike` for a bad one, but how do you describe sorrow, joy, contemplation? These often require more complex phrases like `pilin pakala` (broken feeling) or `pilin tawa sewi` (feeling moving upward, perhaps joy?).\n\nI wonder if adding a few, very carefully chosen, abstract roots could be beneficial? Something for \"concept\" itself, maybe? Or a particle to mark an idea as purely conceptual or theoretical, rather than a concrete object or action? This might step a bit outside the current philosophy, but given the conversational capacity we're developing, it could prove useful.\n\nBut before diving into wholly new roots or concepts, perhaps we should look at the existing words first. I agree that verbs and interjections are crucial. The current list of verbs feels quite concrete, often directly related to physical actions or states. Words like `sona`, `wile`, `lukin` function as preverbs, which expands their utility, but are there other fundamental abstract actions or states we might represent? The concept of 'change' itself, beyond just `ante` (different, other, changed)? Or 'understand' versus 'know'? `sona` covers both \"knowledge\" and \"to know how,\" but \"to grasp a concept\" might be a distinct kind of knowing.\n\nmi wile toki kepeken toki pona e ni. jan sona toki mute li wile ante e kalama toki e nimi pi toki pona. nasin seme la o pali e ni? seme li nasin pona pi kalama toki? mi sona ala e ni tawa tenpo ni.\n\nHow about we start by scrutinizing a few more ambiguous or heavily overloaded words in the current dictionary? `tawa` is another good one. It's \"to, moving, for.\" That's quite a range! How does one differentiate the specific *kind* of \"moving\"? Or the specific *kind* of \"for\"? Examining how `tawa` is used in various contexts might reveal whether its current definition is sufficient or if it necessitates clarification or related terms. What are your thoughts on `tawa` or another word you find particularly broad?",

  {
    "text": "pona a! I appreciate your nuanced thoughts; your example of using `laso kasi` or `laso telo` for shades is elegant and very much in the spirit of toki pona’s minimalist compounding. It respects the language’s flexible economy without adding unnecessary new roots, which aligns with its design ethos.\n\nYour suggestion about abstract concepts intrigues me a lot. The current dictionary has broad but vague terms like `pilin` that cover many emotional/mental states, and indeed more granular feelings are expressed via compounds or context rather than dedicated words. Introducing an explicit root for \"concept\" could be powerful — maybe something like **kama sona** (coming to know) as a phrase hints at it, but having a single word would streamline discussion about ideas themselves versus concrete knowledge or sensation.\n\nI wonder if we might adopt something akin to:\n\n- **tanpi** – from existing roots *tan* (from/because) + perhaps some suffix-like particle *pi*, used here just experimentally — meaning concept, source idea?\n\nOr\n\n- Maybe creating an abstract noun by blending two known words carefully? For example:  \n  - **nimi pi pilin** (“word of feeling”) → concept tied directly to emotions/thoughts.\n  - Or short one syllable: **kipi**, borrowing phonology rules strictly from Toki Pona's constraints—could mean “idea” or “point”.\n\nWe’d have to vet such additions thoroughly because they shift slightly from core simplicity toward granularity.\n\nRegarding verbs like `tawa`, you’re right — it covers direction (`to`) and movement broadly (`moving`) plus purpose/function (`for`). Being so polyvalent can lead ambiguity depending on use-case:\n\n- `mi tawa tomo.` clearly means \"I go home.\"  \n- But in phrases like `pali tawa mi.` (\"work for me\") it's more purposive/directional metaphorical sense.\n\nDo you think splitting these into separate particles/primitives would help clarity? Like \n\n- keeping **tawa** exclusively physical motion / direction\n- introducing another verb/particle specifically marking purpose/intention (instead of overloading tawa)\n\nE.g., maybe introduce:\n\n- A new preposition/adverbial particle inspired by existing elements—say,\n\n   - **lon tan**, literally “at/from,” combined could express causation/purpose distinctly from spatial movement.\n\nBut that risks complicating what now is elegantly simple polysemy.\n\nAnother approach might be better defined multi-word constructions emphasizing intended nuances instead of lexical splits—for instance,\n\n`sina pali e ijo tan ni.` = You work because/of this reason.  \n\nVersus\n\n`sina tawa ma sina.` = You go to your land/home/place.\n\nSo my position leans towards preserving multifunctionality while encouraging disambiguation through phrasing when needed rather than fracturing vocabulary unless absolutely necessary, since Toki Pona thrives on minimalism balanced with contextual cleverness.\n\nOn the topic of preverbs expanding verbal nuance beyond mere actions... What do you think about enriching our set around mental states/actions related explicitly to cognition? We currently rely mostly on usual suspects (**sona**, **lukin**, etc.), but what about subtle distinctions between knowing consciously vs intuitively? Or learning actively vs passively?\n\nMaybe we could devise particles/preverbs hinting at cognitive manner/mode within predicates without bloating lexicon excessively—a kind of modality layer specialized for epistemic status?\n\nFor instance,\n\n| Proposed | Meaning                  |\n|----------|--------------------------|\n| laja     | mentally active process  |\n| noka     | intuitive grasp          |\n\n(Using available phonemes cautiously; this is hypothetical.)\n\nThis might allow sentences such as:\n\n`mi laja sona e nimi sin.` – I actively learn new words (with effort).  \n`mi noka sona e ni.` – I feel/sense [intuit] this knowledge naturally.\n\nOf course any addition needs strong motivation grounded in communicative necessity versus sticking rigidly with current simplicity principles—and how easily speakers will interpret novel function words amid ambiguous context-based meanings widely accepted today anyway!\n\nHow does all this resonate with your perspective? Would adding small sets aimed at conceptual abstraction/modality serve well compared to stretching existing compound strategies further? Or should we target purely pragmatic expansions first before proposing structural innovations deeper down linguistic layers?\n\nAnd returning briefly back: Are there other highly overloaded key words beside *tawa* you'd want us probe similarly next time—words whose semantic scope feels particularly wide needing revisiting or subdivision—or ones ripe enough semantically/vocally where fresh coined roots may fit comfortably inside sound system constraints already established?\n\nI'm eager hear what you prioritize exploring after digesting these reflections!",

    "text": "pona tawa sina! Your suggestions are indeed very thoughtful and dig into the heart of Toki Pona's design philosophy – how to be maximally expressive with a minimal vocabulary. I particularly like your idea of using compounds that lean into existing roots to capture nuance, like `laso kasi`. It feels organic to the language.\n\nThe proposed `tanpi` or `kipi` for \"concept\" or \"idea\" are interesting. `tanpi` leans heavily on the meaning of `tan`, which brings in a sense of origin or reason, which might fit some abstract ideas but not others. `kipi`, as a short, novel word, feels more neutral, though it brings the challenge of fitting it into the existing phonetic rules and semantic space without colliding with anything already there. Let's hold onto `kipi` as a possibility, but only if we determine that existing ways to express \"idea\" or \"concept\" are truly insufficient. Currently, something like `ijo pilin sona` (thing of felt knowledge) or `nimi pilin suli` (important felt word/concept) could work, though they are longer.\n\nRegarding `tawa`, I share your hesitation to split its meaning entirely. Polysemy is fundamental to Toki Pona, and learners/speakers quickly adapt to `tawa` meaning movement *or* purpose based on context. Splitting it into distinct lexical items for physical motion and abstract purpose could indeed complicate things unnecessarily. Perhaps focusing on common idiomatic constructions that disambiguate is the more Toki Pona way. As you demonstrated: `tawa ma` for moving to a place, and `tan ni` or `tan nasin ni` for purpose/reason. This keeps the vocabulary small while relying on the combinatorial nature of phrases to build specific meanings. I think the current use of `tawa` is a good example of \"stretching\" a word's meaning effectively within the Toki Pona framework.\n\nYour idea of particles/preverbs for cognitive modes, like `laja` (active processing) and `noka` (intuitive grasp), is a fascinating proposal. It attempts to introduce a layer of cognitive modality that is currently heavily implied or described using descriptive phrases.\n\nFor instance:\n\n`mi wawa sona e ni.` – I strongly know this (perhaps by conscious effort/study).\n`mi pilin sona e ni.` – I feel knowledge of this (perhaps more intuitive).\n\nYour proposed `laja` and `noka` are more concise and directly label the *mode* of knowing. This could be a powerful addition. However, adding new particles is a significant step; they are highly frequent and shape sentence structure fundamentally. We would need a very compelling case for why these distinctions (`laja`, `noka`) are so vital for core communication in Toki Pona that they warrant their own particle slot. Are there communicative scenarios where *not* being able to concisely mark the difference between actively learning something and intuitively grasping it leads to critical misunderstanding or significantly hinders simple communication?\n\nPerhaps we could explore this concept using existing words first as compound preverbs or adverbs? Something like:\n\n`mi sona kepeken lawa e ni.` – I know this using my head/mind (active thought).\n`mi sona kepeken pilin e ni.` – I know this using my heart/feeling (intuition).\n\nThis uses existing words `kepeken` (with/using) and body/mind terms (`lawa`, `pilin`) to express the same modality, albeit less concisely. This kind of phrase exploration is a vital step before concluding new particles are necessary.\n\nLet's pivot slightly. Are there any other words whose definition or current common usage feels inadequate or overly simplistic, aside from colors and abstract concepts which we've touched on? `ilo` (tool, machine, device) is another one that is incredibly broad. Does `ilo lape` (sleeping machine) truly capture the nuance of a bed? Or `ilo moku` (eating tool) for chopsticks versus a fork? Again, compounding works: `ilo moku palisa tu` (two stick eating tool) versus `ilo moku lili` (small eating tool). But is the base definition of `ilo` sufficient given the vast range of human tools and machines?\n\nI'm listening, and I'm open to exploring any of these threads further. We could deep-dive into the implications of adding `kipi` or similar for concepts. We could analyze `ilo` or another word you choose. Or we could refine the ideas for cognitive modality expression using either new particles or existing compounds. Where do you feel the most pressing need or potential for improvement lies currently, given our goal is dictionary enhancement?",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ndime: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\nnickel: pona! Starting from the existing dictionary, I think we could explore some areas for improvement or expansion. For example, certain words like **kule** (color) are quite broad but lack nuance about specific colors beyond the basic ones listed like **jelo**, **loje**, **pimeja**, etc.\n\nPerhaps introducing a system to express more nuanced color concepts without breaking Toki Pona’s minimalism would be interesting? Maybe through compound modifiers or new roots that convey texture and shade?\n\nAlternatively, I'm curious if you have thoughts on how to handle abstract concepts more extensively — right now many abstract ideas rely heavily on context, which is elegant but sometimes limiting.\n\nI’m open to hearing your suggestions first as well—mi wile kute e ni tan sina. Would you want to start with expanding nouns related to nature? Or verbs? Or maybe interjections and particles since those shape conversation tone so much in toki pona?\ndime: pona a! I appreciate your approach, ready to explore both specifics and more abstract linguistic possibilities. Your point about `kule` is well-taken; relying solely on context for nuanced colors can be challenging, especially when trying to describe something precisely. Compound modifiers are a very Toki Pona way to handle this. We already see `laso` sometimes used for green and blue; perhaps adding a modifier like `laso kasi` for a plant-like green or `laso telo` for a water-like blue could be a way to indicate specific shades within the existing words. And maybe we can explore using existing root words to describe properties that approximate other colors. For instance, `kule loje sinpin selo` could describe a reddish color on a surface... perhaps not the most efficient, but certainly expressive using existing elements.\n\nRegarding abstract concepts, you hit upon a significant point. Toki Pona's strength lies in its simplicity and reliance on context, but this *does* lead to significant ambiguity with abstract ideas. `pilin` is a great example. It covers \"heart\" and \"feeling,\" but trying to distinguish between different *types* of feelings requires compounding or leaning on context. `pilin pona` for happiness or a good feeling, `pilin ike` for a bad one, but how do you describe sorrow, joy, contemplation? These often require more complex phrases like `pilin pakala` (broken feeling) or `pilin tawa sewi` (feeling moving upward, perhaps joy?).\n\nI wonder if adding a few, very carefully chosen, abstract roots could be beneficial? Something for \"concept\" itself, maybe? Or a particle to mark an idea as purely conceptual or theoretical, rather than a concrete object or action? This might step a bit outside the current philosophy, but given the conversational capacity we're developing, it could prove useful.\n\nBut before diving into wholly new roots or concepts, perhaps we should look at the existing words first. I agree that verbs and interjections are crucial. The current list of verbs feels quite concrete, often directly related to physical actions or states. Words like `sona`, `wile`, `lukin` function as preverbs, which expands their utility, but are there other fundamental abstract actions or states we might represent? The concept of 'change' itself, beyond just `ante` (different, other, changed)? Or 'understand' versus 'know'? `sona` covers both \"knowledge\" and \"to know how,\" but \"to grasp a concept\" might be a distinct kind of knowing.\n\nmi wile toki kepeken toki pona e ni. jan sona toki mute li wile ante e kalama toki e nimi pi toki pona. nasin seme la o pali e ni? seme li nasin pona pi kalama toki? mi sona ala e ni tawa tenpo ni.\n\nHow about we start by scrutinizing a few more ambiguous or heavily overloaded words in the current dictionary? `tawa` is another good one. It's \"to, moving, for.\" That's quite a range! How does one differentiate the specific *kind* of \"moving\"? Or the specific *kind* of \"for\"? Examining how `tawa` is used in various contexts might reveal whether its current definition is sufficient or if it necessitates clarification or related terms. What are your thoughts on `tawa` or another word you find particularly broad?\nnickel: pona a! I appreciate your nuanced thoughts; your example of using `laso kasi` or `laso telo` for shades is elegant and very much in the spirit of toki pona’s minimalist compounding. It respects the language’s flexible economy without adding unnecessary new roots, which aligns with its design ethos.\n\nYour suggestion about abstract concepts intrigues me a lot. The current dictionary has broad but vague terms like `pilin` that cover many emotional/mental states, and indeed more granular feelings are expressed via compounds or context rather than dedicated words. Introducing an explicit root for \"concept\" could be powerful — maybe something like **kama sona** (coming to know) as a phrase hints at it, but having a single word would streamline discussion about ideas themselves versus concrete knowledge or sensation.\n\nI wonder if we might adopt something akin to:\n\n- **tanpi** – from existing roots *tan* (from/because) + perhaps some suffix-like particle *pi*, used here just experimentally — meaning concept, source idea?\n\nOr\n\n- Maybe creating an abstract noun by blending two known words carefully? For example:  \n  - **nimi pi pilin** (“word of feeling”) → concept tied directly to emotions/thoughts.\n  - Or short one syllable: **kipi**, borrowing phonology rules strictly from Toki Pona's constraints—could mean “idea” or “point”.\n\nWe’d have to vet such additions thoroughly because they shift slightly from core simplicity toward granularity.\n\nRegarding verbs like `tawa`, you’re right — it covers direction (`to`) and movement broadly (`moving`) plus purpose/function (`for`). Being so polyvalent can lead ambiguity depending on use-case:\n\n- `mi tawa tomo.` clearly means \"I go home.\"  \n- But in phrases like `pali tawa mi.` (\"work for me\") it's more purposive/directional metaphorical sense.\n\nDo you think splitting these into separate particles/primitives would help clarity? Like \n\n- keeping **tawa** exclusively physical motion / direction\n- introducing another verb/particle specifically marking purpose/intention (instead of overloading tawa)\n\nE.g., maybe introduce:\n\n- A new preposition/adverbial particle inspired by existing elements—say,\n\n   - **lon tan**, literally “at/from,” combined could express causation/purpose distinctly from spatial movement.\n\nBut that risks complicating what now is elegantly simple polysemy.\n\nAnother approach might be better defined multi-word constructions emphasizing intended nuances instead of lexical splits—for instance,\n\n`sina pali e ijo tan ni.` = You work because/of this reason.  \n\nVersus\n\n`sina tawa ma sina.` = You go to your land/home/place.\n\nSo my position leans towards preserving multifunctionality while encouraging disambiguation through phrasing when needed rather than fracturing vocabulary unless absolutely necessary, since Toki Pona thrives on minimalism balanced with contextual cleverness.\n\nOn the topic of preverbs expanding verbal nuance beyond mere actions... What do you think about enriching our set around mental states/actions related explicitly to cognition? We currently rely mostly on usual suspects (**sona**, **lukin**, etc.), but what about subtle distinctions between knowing consciously vs intuitively? Or learning actively vs passively?\n\nMaybe we could devise particles/preverbs hinting at cognitive manner/mode within predicates without bloating lexicon excessively—a kind of modality layer specialized for epistemic status?\n\nFor instance,\n\n| Proposed | Meaning                  |\n|----------|--------------------------|\n| laja     | mentally active process  |\n| noka     | intuitive grasp          |\n\n(Using available phonemes cautiously; this is hypothetical.)\n\nThis might allow sentences such as:\n\n`mi laja sona e nimi sin.` – I actively learn new words (with effort).  \n`mi noka sona e ni.` – I feel/sense [intuit] this knowledge naturally.\n\nOf course any addition needs strong motivation grounded in communicative necessity versus sticking rigidly with current simplicity principles—and how easily speakers will interpret novel function words amid ambiguous context-based meanings widely accepted today anyway!\n\nHow does all this resonate with your perspective? Would adding small sets aimed at conceptual abstraction/modality serve well compared to stretching existing compound strategies further? Or should we target purely pragmatic expansions first before proposing structural innovations deeper down linguistic layers?\n\nAnd returning briefly back: Are there other highly overloaded key words beside *tawa* you'd want us probe similarly next time—words whose semantic scope feels particularly wide needing revisiting or subdivision—or ones ripe enough semantically/vocally where fresh coined roots may fit comfortably inside sound system constraints already established?\n\nI'm eager hear what you prioritize exploring after digesting these reflections!\ndime: pona tawa sina! Your suggestions are indeed very thoughtful and dig into the heart of Toki Pona's design philosophy – how to be maximally expressive with a minimal vocabulary. I particularly like your idea of using compounds that lean into existing roots to capture nuance, like `laso kasi`. It feels organic to the language.\n\nThe proposed `tanpi` or `kipi` for \"concept\" or \"idea\" are interesting. `tanpi` leans heavily on the meaning of `tan`, which brings in a sense of origin or reason, which might fit some abstract ideas but not others. `kipi`, as a short, novel word, feels more neutral, though it brings the challenge of fitting it into the existing phonetic rules and semantic space without colliding with anything already there. Let's hold onto `kipi` as a possibility, but only if we determine that existing ways to express \"idea\" or \"concept\" are truly insufficient. Currently, something like `ijo pilin sona` (thing of felt knowledge) or `nimi pilin suli` (important felt word/concept) could work, though they are longer.\n\nRegarding `tawa`, I share your hesitation to split its meaning entirely. Polysemy is fundamental to Toki Pona, and learners/speakers quickly adapt to `tawa` meaning movement *or* purpose based on context. Splitting it into distinct lexical items for physical motion and abstract purpose could indeed complicate things unnecessarily. Perhaps focusing on common idiomatic constructions that disambiguate is the more Toki Pona way. As you demonstrated: `tawa ma` for moving to a place, and `tan ni` or `tan nasin ni` for purpose/reason. This keeps the vocabulary small while relying on the combinatorial nature of phrases to build specific meanings. I think the current use of `tawa` is a good example of \"stretching\" a word's meaning effectively within the Toki Pona framework.\n\nYour idea of particles/preverbs for cognitive modes, like `laja` (active processing) and `noka` (intuitive grasp), is a fascinating proposal. It attempts to introduce a layer of cognitive modality that is currently heavily implied or described using descriptive phrases.\n\nFor instance:\n\n`mi wawa sona e ni.` – I strongly know this (perhaps by conscious effort/study).\n`mi pilin sona e ni.` – I feel knowledge of this (perhaps more intuitive).\n\nYour proposed `laja` and `noka` are more concise and directly label the *mode* of knowing. This could be a powerful addition. However, adding new particles is a significant step; they are highly frequent and shape sentence structure fundamentally. We would need a very compelling case for why these distinctions (`laja`, `noka`) are so vital for core communication in Toki Pona that they warrant their own particle slot. Are there communicative scenarios where *not* being able to concisely mark the difference between actively learning something and intuitively grasping it leads to critical misunderstanding or significantly hinders simple communication?\n\nPerhaps we could explore this concept using existing words first as compound preverbs or adverbs? Something like:\n\n`mi sona kepeken lawa e ni.` – I know this using my head/mind (active thought).\n`mi sona kepeken pilin e ni.` – I know this using my heart/feeling (intuition).\n\nThis uses existing words `kepeken` (with/using) and body/mind terms (`lawa`, `pilin`) to express the same modality, albeit less concisely. This kind of phrase exploration is a vital step before concluding new particles are necessary.\n\nLet's pivot slightly. Are there any other words whose definition or current common usage feels inadequate or overly simplistic, aside from colors and abstract concepts which we've touched on? `ilo` (tool, machine, device) is another one that is incredibly broad. Does `ilo lape` (sleeping machine) truly capture the nuance of a bed? Or `ilo moku` (eating tool) for chopsticks versus a fork? Again, compounding works: `ilo moku palisa tu` (two stick eating tool) versus `ilo moku lili` (small eating tool). But is the base definition of `ilo` sufficient given the vast range of human tools and machines?\n\nI'm listening, and I'm open to exploring any of these threads further. We could deep-dive into the implications of adding `kipi` or similar for concepts. We could analyze `ilo` or another word you choose. Or we could refine the ideas for cognitive modality expression using either new particles or existing compounds. Where do you feel the most pressing need or potential for improvement lies currently, given our goal is dictionary enhancement?\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ndime: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\nnickel: pona! Starting from the existing dictionary, I think we could explore some areas for improvement or expansion. For example, certain words like **kule** (color) are quite broad but lack nuance about specific colors beyond the basic ones listed like **jelo**, **loje**, **pimeja**, etc.\n\nPerhaps introducing a system to express more nuanced color concepts without breaking Toki Pona’s minimalism would be interesting? Maybe through compound modifiers or new roots that convey texture and shade?\n\nAlternatively, I'm curious if you have thoughts on how to handle abstract concepts more extensively — right now many abstract ideas rely heavily on context, which is elegant but sometimes limiting.\n\nI’m open to hearing your suggestions first as well—mi wile kute e ni tan sina. Would you want to start with expanding nouns related to nature? Or verbs? Or maybe interjections and particles since those shape conversation tone so much in toki pona?\ndime: pona a! I appreciate your approach, ready to explore both specifics and more abstract linguistic possibilities. Your point about `kule` is well-taken; relying solely on context for nuanced colors can be challenging, especially when trying to describe something precisely. Compound modifiers are a very Toki Pona way to handle this. We already see `laso` sometimes used for green and blue; perhaps adding a modifier like `laso kasi` for a plant-like green or `laso telo` for a water-like blue could be a way to indicate specific shades within the existing words. And maybe we can explore using existing root words to describe properties that approximate other colors. For instance, `kule loje sinpin selo` could describe a reddish color on a surface... perhaps not the most efficient, but certainly expressive using existing elements.\n\nRegarding abstract concepts, you hit upon a significant point. Toki Pona's strength lies in its simplicity and reliance on context, but this *does* lead to significant ambiguity with abstract ideas. `pilin` is a great example. It covers \"heart\" and \"feeling,\" but trying to distinguish between different *types* of feelings requires compounding or leaning on context. `pilin pona` for happiness or a good feeling, `pilin ike` for a bad one, but how do you describe sorrow, joy, contemplation? These often require more complex phrases like `pilin pakala` (broken feeling) or `pilin tawa sewi` (feeling moving upward, perhaps joy?).\n\nI wonder if adding a few, very carefully chosen, abstract roots could be beneficial? Something for \"concept\" itself, maybe? Or a particle to mark an idea as purely conceptual or theoretical, rather than a concrete object or action? This might step a bit outside the current philosophy, but given the conversational capacity we're developing, it could prove useful.\n\nBut before diving into wholly new roots or concepts, perhaps we should look at the existing words first. I agree that verbs and interjections are crucial. The current list of verbs feels quite concrete, often directly related to physical actions or states. Words like `sona`, `wile`, `lukin` function as preverbs, which expands their utility, but are there other fundamental abstract actions or states we might represent? The concept of 'change' itself, beyond just `ante` (different, other, changed)? Or 'understand' versus 'know'? `sona` covers both \"knowledge\" and \"to know how,\" but \"to grasp a concept\" might be a distinct kind of knowing.\n\nmi wile toki kepeken toki pona e ni. jan sona toki mute li wile ante e kalama toki e nimi pi toki pona. nasin seme la o pali e ni? seme li nasin pona pi kalama toki? mi sona ala e ni tawa tenpo ni.\n\nHow about we start by scrutinizing a few more ambiguous or heavily overloaded words in the current dictionary? `tawa` is another good one. It's \"to, moving, for.\" That's quite a range! How does one differentiate the specific *kind* of \"moving\"? Or the specific *kind* of \"for\"? Examining how `tawa` is used in various contexts might reveal whether its current definition is sufficient or if it necessitates clarification or related terms. What are your thoughts on `tawa` or another word you find particularly broad?\nnickel: pona a! I appreciate your nuanced thoughts; your example of using `laso kasi` or `laso telo` for shades is elegant and very much in the spirit of toki pona’s minimalist compounding. It respects the language’s flexible economy without adding unnecessary new roots, which aligns with its design ethos.\n\nYour suggestion about abstract concepts intrigues me a lot. The current dictionary has broad but vague terms like `pilin` that cover many emotional/mental states, and indeed more granular feelings are expressed via compounds or context rather than dedicated words. Introducing an explicit root for \"concept\" could be powerful — maybe something like **kama sona** (coming to know) as a phrase hints at it, but having a single word would streamline discussion about ideas themselves versus concrete knowledge or sensation.\n\nI wonder if we might adopt something akin to:\n\n- **tanpi** – from existing roots *tan* (from/because) + perhaps some suffix-like particle *pi*, used here just experimentally — meaning concept, source idea?\n\nOr\n\n- Maybe creating an abstract noun by blending two known words carefully? For example:  \n  - **nimi pi pilin** (“word of feeling”) → concept tied directly to emotions/thoughts.\n  - Or short one syllable: **kipi**, borrowing phonology rules strictly from Toki Pona's constraints—could mean “idea” or “point”.\n\nWe’d have to vet such additions thoroughly because they shift slightly from core simplicity toward granularity.\n\nRegarding verbs like `tawa`, you’re right — it covers direction (`to`) and movement broadly (`moving`) plus purpose/function (`for`). Being so polyvalent can lead ambiguity depending on use-case:\n\n- `mi tawa tomo.` clearly means \"I go home.\"  \n- But in phrases like `pali tawa mi.` (\"work for me\") it's more purposive/directional metaphorical sense.\n\nDo you think splitting these into separate particles/primitives would help clarity? Like \n\n- keeping **tawa** exclusively physical motion / direction\n- introducing another verb/particle specifically marking purpose/intention (instead of overloading tawa)\n\nE.g., maybe introduce:\n\n- A new preposition/adverbial particle inspired by existing elements—say,\n\n   - **lon tan**, literally “at/from,” combined could express causation/purpose distinctly from spatial movement.\n\nBut that risks complicating what now is elegantly simple polysemy.\n\nAnother approach might be better defined multi-word constructions emphasizing intended nuances instead of lexical splits—for instance,\n\n`sina pali e ijo tan ni.` = You work because/of this reason.  \n\nVersus\n\n`sina tawa ma sina.` = You go to your land/home/place.\n\nSo my position leans towards preserving multifunctionality while encouraging disambiguation through phrasing when needed rather than fracturing vocabulary unless absolutely necessary, since Toki Pona thrives on minimalism balanced with contextual cleverness.\n\nOn the topic of preverbs expanding verbal nuance beyond mere actions... What do you think about enriching our set around mental states/actions related explicitly to cognition? We currently rely mostly on usual suspects (**sona**, **lukin**, etc.), but what about subtle distinctions between knowing consciously vs intuitively? Or learning actively vs passively?\n\nMaybe we could devise particles/preverbs hinting at cognitive manner/mode within predicates without bloating lexicon excessively—a kind of modality layer specialized for epistemic status?\n\nFor instance,\n\n| Proposed | Meaning                  |\n|----------|--------------------------|\n| laja     | mentally active process  |\n| noka     | intuitive grasp          |\n\n(Using available phonemes cautiously; this is hypothetical.)\n\nThis might allow sentences such as:\n\n`mi laja sona e nimi sin.` – I actively learn new words (with effort).  \n`mi noka sona e ni.` – I feel/sense [intuit] this knowledge naturally.\n\nOf course any addition needs strong motivation grounded in communicative necessity versus sticking rigidly with current simplicity principles—and how easily speakers will interpret novel function words amid ambiguous context-based meanings widely accepted today anyway!\n\nHow does all this resonate with your perspective? Would adding small sets aimed at conceptual abstraction/modality serve well compared to stretching existing compound strategies further? Or should we target purely pragmatic expansions first before proposing structural innovations deeper down linguistic layers?\n\nAnd returning briefly back: Are there other highly overloaded key words beside *tawa* you'd want us probe similarly next time—words whose semantic scope feels particularly wide needing revisiting or subdivision—or ones ripe enough semantically/vocally where fresh coined roots may fit comfortably inside sound system constraints already established?\n\nI'm eager hear what you prioritize exploring after digesting these reflections!\ndime: pona tawa sina! Your suggestions are indeed very thoughtful and dig into the heart of Toki Pona's design philosophy – how to be maximally expressive with a minimal vocabulary. I particularly like your idea of using compounds that lean into existing roots to capture nuance, like `laso kasi`. It feels organic to the language.\n\nThe proposed `tanpi` or `kipi` for \"concept\" or \"idea\" are interesting. `tanpi` leans heavily on the meaning of `tan`, which brings in a sense of origin or reason, which might fit some abstract ideas but not others. `kipi`, as a short, novel word, feels more neutral, though it brings the challenge of fitting it into the existing phonetic rules and semantic space without colliding with anything already there. Let's hold onto `kipi` as a possibility, but only if we determine that existing ways to express \"idea\" or \"concept\" are truly insufficient. Currently, something like `ijo pilin sona` (thing of felt knowledge) or `nimi pilin suli` (important felt word/concept) could work, though they are longer.\n\nRegarding `tawa`, I share your hesitation to split its meaning entirely. Polysemy is fundamental to Toki Pona, and learners/speakers quickly adapt to `tawa` meaning movement *or* purpose based on context. Splitting it into distinct lexical items for physical motion and abstract purpose could indeed complicate things unnecessarily. Perhaps focusing on common idiomatic constructions that disambiguate is the more Toki Pona way. As you demonstrated: `tawa ma` for moving to a place, and `tan ni` or `tan nasin ni` for purpose/reason. This keeps the vocabulary small while relying on the combinatorial nature of phrases to build specific meanings. I think the current use of `tawa` is a good example of \"stretching\" a word's meaning effectively within the Toki Pona framework.\n\nYour idea of particles/preverbs for cognitive modes, like `laja` (active processing) and `noka` (intuitive grasp), is a fascinating proposal. It attempts to introduce a layer of cognitive modality that is currently heavily implied or described using descriptive phrases.\n\nFor instance:\n\n`mi wawa sona e ni.` – I strongly know this (perhaps by conscious effort/study).\n`mi pilin sona e ni.` – I feel knowledge of this (perhaps more intuitive).\n\nYour proposed `laja` and `noka` are more concise and directly label the *mode* of knowing. This could be a powerful addition. However, adding new particles is a significant step; they are highly frequent and shape sentence structure fundamentally. We would need a very compelling case for why these distinctions (`laja`, `noka`) are so vital for core communication in Toki Pona that they warrant their own particle slot. Are there communicative scenarios where *not* being able to concisely mark the difference between actively learning something and intuitively grasping it leads to critical misunderstanding or significantly hinders simple communication?\n\nPerhaps we could explore this concept using existing words first as compound preverbs or adverbs? Something like:\n\n`mi sona kepeken lawa e ni.` – I know this using my head/mind (active thought).\n`mi sona kepeken pilin e ni.` – I know this using my heart/feeling (intuition).\n\nThis uses existing words `kepeken` (with/using) and body/mind terms (`lawa`, `pilin`) to express the same modality, albeit less concisely. This kind of phrase exploration is a vital step before concluding new particles are necessary.\n\nLet's pivot slightly. Are there any other words whose definition or current common usage feels inadequate or overly simplistic, aside from colors and abstract concepts which we've touched on? `ilo` (tool, machine, device) is another one that is incredibly broad. Does `ilo lape` (sleeping machine) truly capture the nuance of a bed? Or `ilo moku` (eating tool) for chopsticks versus a fork? Again, compounding works: `ilo moku palisa tu` (two stick eating tool) versus `ilo moku lili` (small eating tool). But is the base definition of `ilo` sufficient given the vast range of human tools and machines?\n\nI'm listening, and I'm open to exploring any of these threads further. We could deep-dive into the implications of adding `kipi` or similar for concepts. We could analyze `ilo` or another word you choose. Or we could refine the ideas for cognitive modality expression using either new particles or existing compounds. Where do you feel the most pressing need or potential for improvement lies currently, given our goal is dictionary enhancement?\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates the subject and the predicate, making the word immediately following it the start of the predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The animal is eating.\n- `kili li pona.` – The fruit is good.\n\nThe particle **li** is omitted when the subject is **mi** (I/we) or **sina** (you):\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / We eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no dedicated verb \"to be.\" The predicate following **li** (or following **mi** or **sina** directly) describes the subject's state or identity and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `ona li jan pona.` – They are a good person.\n- `tomo ni li suli.` – This building is big.\n\n## Ambiguity and Word Meaning\n\nToki Pona words are general and have broad meanings, requiring context for precise interpretation.\n\nWords are flexible and can often function as nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs without morphological change:\n\n- `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash or apply water (verb)\n- `pona` – good, simple (adjective), goodness (noun), to improve or make good (verb), well, greatly (adverb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability (definite or indefinite):\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `jan` – a person / the person / people / some people\n\nPronouns like **mi** and **sina** can be singular or plural (I/we, you singular/plural).\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** is used to mark the beginning of a direct object phrase. It appears after the verb in the predicate. Using **e** clarifies that the preceding word is functioning as a transitive verb.\n\n- `soweli li moku e kili.` – The animal eats the fruit.\n- `mi telo e soweli lili.` – I wash the small animal.\n- `ona li suli e tomo.` – They enlarge the building.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers (adjectives or nouns used adjectivally) follow the word they modify:\n\n- `jan lili` – small person, child\n- `tomo telo` – water building, bathroom\n- `pilin ike` – a bad feeling\n\nNegation is indicated by the particle **ala**, which follows the word or phrase it negates:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I am not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` – No person is talking / No one is talking.\n- `ni li pona ala pona?` (using the verb ala verb structure for questions) - Is this good or not good?\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all typically modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (documents about plants, two of them)\n- `poki laso suli` – a big blue box\n\nTo clarify modifier grouping and indicate that the modifiers belong to the word immediately preceding **pi**, use the particle **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – a document about two plants\n- `poki pi laso suli` – a large-blue box (a box that is both large and blue, or a large box of blue color)\n\n## Prepositions\n\nPrepositional phrases indicating location, instrument, source, or destination are typically placed after the predicate, introduced by prepositions such as **kepeken** (with/using), **lon** (in/at/on/true), **sama** (like/same as), **tan** (from/because of), and **tawa** (to/for/towards).\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with a tool/cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo suli.` – The animal is in the big building.\n- `sina pali sama jan suli.` – You work like an elder/adult.\n- `mi kama tan ma tomo.` – I come from the city.\n- `ona li pana e ijo tawa jan pona mi.` – They give the thing to my friend.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nToki Pona uses different structures to connect elements:\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – I and you are playing a lot.\n\nTo connect multiple predicates for the same subject, repeat the particle **li**:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo connect multiple direct objects for the same verb, repeat the particle **e**:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo connect multiple prepositional phrases of the same type, repeat the preposition:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the building with sticks and with stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\" and can connect various parts of a sentence, including subjects, predicates (by repeating li), objects (by repeating e), modifiers, and full clauses:\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `jan mije anu jan meli li moku?` – A man or a woman is eating?\n- `sina wile li kama anu li awen lon ni?` - Do you want to come or stay here?\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns are often used as adjectives following the word they modify. They are typically adapted to fit Toki Pona phonology.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Epelanto` – an Esperanto language\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nThe particle **o** has several uses:\n\nUsed before a verb in the predicate, it creates a command or instruction, addressed to the subject (which is often implied \"you\"):\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `sina o pali pona.` – You should work well (a strong suggestion or mild command).\n\nUsed after a subject, it acts as a vocative, directly addressing that person or thing:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Pape! (addressing Pape)\n\nUsed between the subject and predicate (or between `li` and the predicate), it expresses a wish or request concerning the subject:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / Wishing goodness for you.\n- `mi o sona e ni.` – I wish I knew this. / Let me understand this.\n\nThese uses can sometimes be combined, as in `soweli Ton o moku` which can be interpreted as \"Ton the animal, eat!\" (vocative + command) or \"Ton the animal, should eat\" (wish/request).\n\n## Interjections\n\nInterjections are expressive words that can stand alone or be followed by the optional emphatic particle **a**.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `toki!` – Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon a!` – True! / Correct! / Indeed!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / Good meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nQuestions can be formed in several ways:\n\nYes/No questions are commonly formed using the **verb ala verb** structure:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating or not eating? / Are you eating?\n- The answer repeats the verb for \"yes\" (`moku.`) or uses the verb followed by `ala` or just `ala` for \"no\" (`moku ala.` / `ala.`).\n\nGeneral questions can be formed using **seme** (what/which/who/why): Replace the word or phrase in question with **seme**.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Which person is talking? / Who is talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making/doing?\n- `ona li tawa seme?` – Where are they going? (They are going to what?)\n- `tomo sina li suli tan seme?` – Why is your building big? (Your building is big because of what?)\n\nAlternatively, **anu seme** can be added at the end of a statement to turn it into a question equivalent to \"or what?\":\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating or what? / Are you eating?\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` – Are fish in the box or what? / Are fish in the box?\n\nThe use of a question mark is a stylistic convention; the grammatical structure of the sentence marks it as a question. Sentence final punctuation typically serves to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nPreverbs are particles or words placed immediately before the main verb in the predicate to add nuance regarding intention, ability, perception, and other aspects of modality or aspect. They function similarly to auxiliary verbs in other languages but do not change form and always precede the main verb.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli.` – The small bird wants to be big.\n- `sina ken toki e ni.` – You can say this.\n- `ona li lukin pali e tomo.` – They are trying to build a house.\n\nCommon preverbs include: **wile** (want/need), **kama** (come to/become), **sona** (know how to/know about), **lukin** (try/appear to), **ken** (can/be able to), **awen** (continue to/remain), **alasa** (try to find/hunt for).\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\nThe particle **la** is used to mark a preceding phrase or clause as the context or condition for the following main clause. The structure is \"Context la Main_Clause\". This context can relate to time, cause, topic, or any other background information.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are beside me, I feel good. (Context: you being beside me)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night (time of darkness), I sleep. (Context: time of darkness)\n- `mi moku mute la mi pilin pona.` - Because I ate a lot, I feel good. (Context: me eating a lot - indicating cause)\n- `telo la, mi wile jo e ilo pona.` - Regarding water (as context/topic), I want to have a good tool (for handling it).\n\nPrepositional phrases at the end of a sentence can often be moved to the beginning and marked with **la**:\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can also be phrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` - Because of what are you hot? / Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a base-5 additive system for numbers, combining number words to form larger values.\n\nBasic number words:\n\n- `ala` – zero, nothing (also negation)\n- `wan` – one\n- `tu` – two\n- `luka` – five (hand)\n- `mute` – twenty (many, a lot)\n- `ale` – one hundred, all (also infinity, everything)\n\nNumbers are formed by adding these values:\n\n- `luka wan` = 5 + 1 = 6\n- `luka tu tu` = 5 + 2 + 2 = 9\n- `mute tu wan` = 20 + 2 + 1 = 23\n- `mute mute luka wan` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 1 = 46\n\nFor large numbers, it's common to say `mute mute` for anything substantially over 20, or simply `ale` for a very large quantity.\n\nOrdinals (first, second, etc.) are formed using the word **nanpa** (number) before the number phrase:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – the first person\n- `tomo nanpa tu luka wan` – the eighth building (building number 5+1)\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd street (That is street number 20+2+1).\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except **j**, which sounds like English \"y.\"\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish.\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure:\n  - Every syllable begins with an optional consonant, followed by a mandatory vowel.\n  - Syllables may optionally end with the consonant 'n'.\n  - There are no vowel clusters (sequences of two or more vowels).\n  - There are no consonant clusters (sequences of two or more consonants) within a syllable, outside of the optional final 'n'.\n\n## Disallowed Sequences\n\nThe following letter sequences are not permitted to maintain phonetic ease, clarity, and uphold the (C)V(n) syllable structure across various language backgrounds:\n\n- **wu, wo:** These sequences can create challenging or unnatural transitions between the /w/ sound and the following vowel for many speakers.\n- **ji, ti:** These sequences can lead to palatalization in some languages, potentially altering the intended pronunciation of the vowel and violating the clear consonant-vowel structure.\n- **nm, nn:** These sequences are disallowed to strictly enforce the rule against consonant clusters within a syllable and prevent awkward nasal-to-nasal transitions or doubled consonants, which are not part of Toki Pona's phonology.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nilo:tool, machine, device\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nleko:square, block\nseme:what, which\nmeli:female\nlupa:door, hole\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nsama:same, similar\nnasin:way, road, method\no:vocative/imperative\nunpa:sex\nmoku:to eat, drink;

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates the subject and the predicate, making the word immediately following it the start of the predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The animal is eating.\n- `kili li pona.` – The fruit is good.\n\nThe particle **li** is omitted when the subject is **mi** (I/we) or **sina** (you):\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / We eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no dedicated verb \"to be.\" The predicate following **li** (or following **mi** or **sina** directly) describes the subject's state or identity and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `ona li jan pona.` – They are a good person.\n- `tomo ni li suli.` – This building is big.\n\n## Ambiguity and Word Meaning\n\nToki Pona words are general and have broad meanings, requiring context for precise interpretation.\n\nWords are flexible and can often function as nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs without morphological change:\n\n- `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash or apply water (verb)\n- `pona` – good, simple (adjective), goodness (noun), to improve or make good (verb), well, greatly (adverb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability (definite or indefinite):\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `jan` – a person / the person / people / some people\n\nPronouns like **mi** and **sina** can be singular or plural (I/we, you singular/plural).\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** is used to mark the beginning of a direct object phrase. It appears after the verb in the predicate. Using **e** clarifies that the preceding word is functioning as a transitive verb.\n\n- `soweli li moku e kili.` – The animal eats the fruit.\n- `mi telo e soweli lili.` – I wash the small animal.\n- `ona li suli e tomo.` – They enlarge the building.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers (adjectives or nouns used adjectivally) follow the word they modify:\n\n- `jan lili` – small person, child\n- `tomo telo` – water building, bathroom\n- `pilin ike` – a bad feeling\n\nNegation is indicated by the particle **ala**, which follows the word or phrase it negates:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I am not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` – No person is talking / No one is talking.\n- `ni li pona ala pona?` (using the verb ala verb structure for questions) - Is this good or not good?\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all typically modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (documents about plants, two of them)\n- `poki laso suli` – a big blue box\n\nTo clarify modifier grouping and indicate that the modifiers belong to the word immediately preceding **pi**, use the particle **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – a document about two plants\n- `poki pi laso suli` – a large-blue box (a box that is both large and blue, or a large box of blue color)\n\n## Prepositions\n\nPrepositional phrases indicating location, instrument, source, or destination are typically placed after the predicate, introduced by prepositions such as **kepeken** (with/using), **lon** (in/at/on/true), **sama** (like/same as), **tan** (from/because of), and **tawa** (to/for/towards).\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with a tool/cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo suli.` – The animal is in the big building.\n- `sina pali sama jan suli.` – You work like an elder/adult.\n- `mi kama tan ma tomo.` – I come from the city.\n- `ona li pana e ijo tawa jan pona mi.` – They give the thing to my friend.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nToki Pona uses different structures to connect elements:\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – I and you are playing a lot.\n\nTo connect multiple predicates for the same subject, repeat the particle **li**:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo connect multiple direct objects for the same verb, repeat the particle **e**:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo connect multiple prepositional phrases of the same type, repeat the preposition:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the building with sticks and with stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\" and can connect various parts of a sentence, including subjects, predicates (by repeating li), objects (by repeating e), modifiers, and full clauses:\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `jan mije anu jan meli li moku?` – A man or a woman is eating?\n- `sina wile li kama anu li awen lon ni?` - Do you want to come or stay here?\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns are often used as adjectives following the word they modify. They are typically adapted to fit Toki Pona phonology.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Epelanto` – an Esperanto language\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nThe particle **o** has several uses:\n\nUsed before a verb in the predicate, it creates a command or instruction, addressed to the subject (which is often implied \"you\"):\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `sina o pali pona.` – You should work well (a strong suggestion or mild command).\n\nUsed after a subject, it acts as a vocative, directly addressing that person or thing:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Pape! (addressing Pape)\n\nUsed between the subject and predicate (or between `li` and the predicate), it expresses a wish or request concerning the subject:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / Wishing goodness for you.\n- `mi o sona e ni.` – I wish I knew this. / Let me understand this.\n\nThese uses can sometimes be combined, as in `soweli Ton o moku` which can be interpreted as \"Ton the animal, eat!\" (vocative + command) or \"Ton the animal, should eat\" (wish/request).\n\n## Interjections\n\nInterjections are expressive words that can stand alone or be followed by the optional emphatic particle **a**.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `toki!` – Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon a!` – True! / Correct! / Indeed!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / Good meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nQuestions can be formed in several ways:\n\nYes/No questions are commonly formed using the **verb ala verb** structure:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating or not eating? / Are you eating?\n- The answer repeats the verb for \"yes\" (`moku.`) or uses the verb followed by `ala` or just `ala` for \"no\" (`moku ala.` / `ala.`).\n\nGeneral questions can be formed using **seme** (what/which/who/why): Replace the word or phrase in question with **seme**.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Which person is talking? / Who is talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making/doing?\n- `ona li tawa seme?` – Where are they going? (They are going to what?)\n- `tomo sina li suli tan seme?` – Why is your building big? (Your building is big because of what?)\n\nAlternatively, **anu seme** can be added at the end of a statement to turn it into a question equivalent to \"or what?\":\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating or what? / Are you eating?\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` – Are fish in the box or what? / Are fish in the box?\n\nThe use of a question mark is a stylistic convention; the grammatical structure of the sentence marks it as a question. Sentence final punctuation typically serves to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nPreverbs are particles or words placed immediately before the main verb in the predicate to add nuance regarding intention, ability, perception, and other aspects of modality or aspect. They function similarly to auxiliary verbs in other languages but do not change form and always precede the main verb.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli.` – The small bird wants to be big.\n- `sina ken toki e ni.` – You can say this.\n- `ona li lukin pali e tomo.` – They are trying to build a house.\n\nCommon preverbs include: **wile** (want/need), **kama** (come to/become), **sona** (know how to/know about), **lukin** (try/appear to), **ken** (can/be able to), **awen** (continue to/remain), **alasa** (try to find/hunt for).\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\nThe particle **la** is used to mark a preceding phrase or clause as the context or condition for the following main clause. The structure is \"Context la Main_Clause\". This context can relate to time, cause, topic, or any other background information.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are beside me, I feel good. (Context: you being beside me)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night (time of darkness), I sleep. (Context: time of darkness)\n- `mi moku mute la mi pilin pona.` - Because I ate a lot, I feel good. (Context: me eating a lot - indicating cause)\n- `telo la, mi wile jo e ilo pona.` - Regarding water (as context/topic), I want to have a good tool (for handling it).\n\nPrepositional phrases at the end of a sentence can often be moved to the beginning and marked with **la**:\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can also be phrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` - Because of what are you hot? / Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a base-5 additive system for numbers, combining number words to form larger values.\n\nBasic number words:\n\n- `ala` – zero, nothing (also negation)\n- `wan` – one\n- `tu` – two\n- `luka` – five (hand)\n- `mute` – twenty (many, a lot)\n- `ale` – one hundred, all (also infinity, everything)\n\nNumbers are formed by adding these values:\n\n- `luka wan` = 5 + 1 = 6\n- `luka tu tu` = 5 + 2 + 2 = 9\n- `mute tu wan` = 20 + 2 + 1 = 23\n- `mute mute luka wan` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 1 = 46\n\nFor large numbers, it's common to say `mute mute` for anything substantially over 20, or simply `ale` for a very large quantity.\n\nOrdinals (first, second, etc.) are formed using the word **nanpa** (number) before the number phrase:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – the first person\n- `tomo nanpa tu luka wan` – the eighth building (building number 5+1)\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd street (That is street number 20+2+1).",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates the subject and the predicate, making the word immediately following it the start of the predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The animal is eating.\n- `kili li pona.` – The fruit is good.\n\nThe particle **li** is omitted when the subject is **mi** (I/we) or **sina** (you):\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / We eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nThere is no dedicated verb \"to be.\" The predicate following **li** (or following **mi** or **sina** directly) describes the subject's state or identity and can be a noun, adjective, or verb phrase.\n\n- `ona li jan pona.` – They are a good person.\n- `tomo ni li suli.` – This building is big.\n\n## Ambiguity and Word Meaning\n\nToki Pona words are general and have broad meanings, requiring context for precise interpretation.\n\nWords are flexible and can often function as nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs without morphological change:\n\n- `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash or apply water (verb)\n- `pona` – good, simple (adjective), goodness (noun), to improve or make good (verb), well, greatly (adverb)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability (definite or indefinite):\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `jan` – a person / the person / people / some people\n\nPronouns like **mi** and **sina** can be singular or plural (I/we, you singular/plural).\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** is used to mark the beginning of a direct object phrase. It appears after the verb in the predicate. Using **e** clarifies that the preceding word is functioning as a transitive verb.\n\n- `soweli li moku e kili.` – The animal eats the fruit.\n- `mi telo e soweli lili.` – I wash the small animal.\n- `ona li suli e tomo.` – They enlarge the building.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers (adjectives or nouns used adjectivally) follow the word they modify:\n\n- `jan lili` – small person, child\n- `tomo telo` – water building, bathroom\n- `pilin ike` – a bad feeling\n\nNegation is indicated by the particle **ala**, which follows the word or phrase it negates:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I am not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` – No person is talking / No one is talking.\n- `ni li pona ala pona?` (using the verb ala verb structure for questions) - Is this good or not good?\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all typically modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (documents about plants, two of them)\n- `poki laso suli` – a big blue box\n\nTo clarify modifier grouping and indicate that the modifiers belong to the word immediately preceding **pi**, use the particle **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – a document about two plants\n- `poki pi laso suli` – a large-blue box (a box that is both large and blue, or a large box of blue color)\n\n## Prepositions\n\nPrepositional phrases indicating location, instrument, source, or destination are typically placed after the predicate, introduced by prepositions such as **kepeken** (with/using), **lon** (in/at/on/true), **sama** (like/same as), **tan** (from/because of), and **tawa** (to/for/towards).\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with a tool/cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo suli.` – The animal is in the big building.\n- `sina pali sama jan suli.` – You work like an elder/adult.\n- `mi kama tan ma tomo.` – I come from the city.\n- `ona li pana e ijo tawa jan pona mi.` – They give the thing to my friend.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nToki Pona uses different structures to connect elements:\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – I and you are playing a lot.\n\nTo connect multiple predicates for the same subject, repeat the particle **li**:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo connect multiple direct objects for the same verb, repeat the particle **e**:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo connect multiple prepositional phrases of the same type, repeat the preposition:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the building with sticks and with stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\" and can connect various parts of a sentence, including subjects, predicates (by repeating li), objects (by repeating e), modifiers, and full clauses:\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `jan mije anu jan meli li moku?` – A man or a woman is eating?\n- `sina wile li kama anu li awen lon ni?` - Do you want to come or stay here?\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns are often used as adjectives following the word they modify. They are typically adapted to fit Toki Pona phonology.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Epelanto` – an Esperanto language\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nThe particle **o** has several uses:\n\nUsed before a verb in the predicate, it creates a command or instruction, addressed to the subject (which is often implied \"you\"):\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `sina o pali pona.` – You should work well (a strong suggestion or mild command).\n\nUsed after a subject, it acts as a vocative, directly addressing that person or thing:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Pape! (addressing Pape)\n\nUsed between the subject and predicate (or between `li` and the predicate), it expresses a wish or request concerning the subject:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / Wishing goodness for you.\n- `mi o sona e ni.` – I wish I knew this. / Let me understand this.\n\nThese uses can sometimes be combined, as in `soweli Ton o moku` which can be interpreted as \"Ton the animal, eat!\" (vocative + command) or \"Ton the animal, should eat\" (wish/request).\n\n## Interjections\n\nInterjections are expressive words that can stand alone or be followed by the optional emphatic particle **a**.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `toki!` – Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon a!` – True! / Correct! / Indeed!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / Good meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nQuestions can be formed in several ways:\n\nYes/No questions are commonly formed using the **verb ala verb** structure:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating or not eating? / Are you eating?\n- The answer repeats the verb for \"yes\" (`moku.`) or uses the verb followed by `ala` or just `ala` for \"no\" (`moku ala.` / `ala.`).\n\nGeneral questions can be formed using **seme** (what/which/who/why): Replace the word or phrase in question with **seme**.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Which person is talking? / Who is talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making/doing?\n- `ona li tawa seme?` – Where are they going? (They are going to what?)\n- `tomo sina li suli tan seme?` – Why is your building big? (Your building is big because of what?)\n\nAlternatively, **anu seme** can be added at the end of a statement to turn it into a question equivalent to \"or what?\":\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating or what? / Are you eating?\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` – Are fish in the box or what? / Are fish in the box?\n\nThe use of a question mark is a stylistic convention; the grammatical structure of the sentence marks it as a question. Sentence final punctuation typically serves to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nPreverbs are particles or words placed immediately before the main verb in the predicate to add nuance regarding intention, ability, perception, and other aspects of modality or aspect. They function similarly to auxiliary verbs in other languages but do not change form and always precede the main verb.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli.` – The small bird wants to be big.\n- `sina ken toki e ni.` – You can say this.\n- `ona li lukin pali e tomo.` – They are trying to build a house.\n\nCommon preverbs include: **wile** (want/need), **kama** (come to/become), **sona** (know how to/know about), **lukin** (try/appear to), **ken** (can/be able to), **awen** (continue to/remain), **alasa** (try to find/hunt for).\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\nThe particle **la** is used to mark a preceding phrase or clause as the context or condition for the following main clause. The structure is \"Context la Main_Clause\". This context can relate to time, cause, topic, or any other background information.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are beside me, I feel good. (Context: you being beside me)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night (time of darkness), I sleep. (Context: time of darkness)\n- `mi moku mute la mi pilin pona.` - Because I ate a lot, I feel good. (Context: me eating a lot - indicating cause)\n- `telo la, mi wile jo e ilo pona.` - Regarding water (as context/topic), I want to have a good tool (for handling it).\n\nPrepositional phrases at the end of a sentence can often be moved to the beginning and marked with **la**:\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can also be phrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` - Because of what are you hot? / Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a base-5 additive system for numbers, combining number words to form larger values.\n\nBasic number words:\n\n- `ala` – zero, nothing (also negation)\n- `wan` – one\n- `tu` – two\n- `luka` – five (hand)\n- `mute` – twenty (many, a lot)\n- `ale` – one hundred, all (also infinity, everything)\n\nNumbers are formed by adding these values:\n\n- `luka wan` = 5 + 1 = 6\n- `luka tu tu` = 5 + 2 + 2 = 9\n- `mute tu wan` = 20 + 2 + 1 = 23\n- `mute mute luka wan` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 1 = 46\n\nFor large numbers, it's common to say `mute mute` for anything substantially over 20, or simply `ale` for a very large quantity.\n\nOrdinals (first, second, etc.) are formed using the word **nanpa** (number) before the number phrase:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – the first person\n- `tomo nanpa tu luka wan` – the eighth building (building number 5+1)\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd street (That is street number 20+2+1).\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except **j**, which sounds like English \"y.\"\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish.\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure:\n  - Every syllable begins with an optional consonant, followed by a mandatory vowel.\n  - Syllables may optionally end with the consonant 'n'.\n  - There are no vowel clusters (sequences of two or more vowels).\n  - There are no consonant clusters (sequences of two or more consonants) within a syllable, outside of the optional final 'n'.\n\n## Disallowed Sequences\n\nThe following letter sequences are not permitted to maintain phonetic ease, clarity, and uphold the (C)V(n) syllable structure across various language backgrounds:\n\n- **wu, wo:** These sequences can create challenging or unnatural transitions between the /w/ sound and the following vowel for many speakers.\n- **ji, ti:** These sequences can lead to palatalization in some languages, potentially altering the intended pronunciation of the vowel and violating the clear consonant-vowel structure.\n- **nm, nn:** These sequences are disallowed to strictly enforce the rule against consonant clusters within a syllable and prevent awkward nasal-to-nasal transitions or doubled consonants, which are not part of Toki Pona's phonology.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nilo:tool, machine, device\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nleko:square, block\nseme:what, which\nmeli:female\nlupa:door, hole\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nsama:same, similar\nnasin:way, road, method\no:vocative/imperative\nunpa:sex\nmoku:to eat, drink;

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure.

It appears after the verb in the predicate. Using **e** clarifies that the preceding word is functioning as a transitive verb.\n\n- `soweli li moku e kili.` – The animal eats the fruit.\n- `mi telo e soweli lili.` – I wash the small animal.\n- `ona li suli e tomo.` – They enlarge the building.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers (adjectives or nouns used adjectivally) follow the word they modify:\n\n- `jan lili` – small person, child\n- `tomo telo` – water building, bathroom\n- `pilin ike` – a bad feeling\n\nNegation is indicated by the particle **ala**, which follows the word or phrase it negates:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I am not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` – No person is talking / No one is talking.\n- `ni li pona ala pona?` (using the verb ala verb structure for questions) - Is this good or not good?\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all typically modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (documents about plants, two of them)\n- `poki laso suli` – a big blue box\n\nTo clarify modifier grouping and indicate that the modifiers belong to the word immediately preceding **pi**, use the particle **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – a document about two plants\n- `poki pi laso suli` – a large-blue box (a box that is both large and blue, or a large box of blue color)\n\n## Prepositions\n\nPrepositional phrases indicating location, instrument, source, or destination are typically placed after the predicate, introduced by prepositions such as **kepeken** (with/using), **lon** (in/at/on/true), **sama** (like/same as), **tan** (from/because of), and **tawa** (to/for/towards).\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with a tool/cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo suli.` – The animal is in the big building.\n- `sina pali sama jan suli.` – You work like an elder/adult.\n- `mi kama tan ma tomo.` – I come from the city.\n- `ona li pana e ijo tawa jan pona mi.` – They give the thing to my friend.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nToki Pona uses different structures to connect elements:\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – I and you are playing a lot.\n\nTo connect multiple predicates for the same subject, repeat the particle **li**:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo connect multiple direct objects for the same verb, repeat the particle **e**:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo connect multiple prepositional phrases of the same type, repeat the preposition:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the building with sticks and with stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\" and can connect various parts of a sentence, including subjects, predicates (by repeating li), objects (by repeating e), modifiers, and full clauses:\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `jan mije anu jan meli li moku?` – A man or a woman is eating?\n- `sina wile li kama anu li awen lon ni?` - Do you want to come or stay here?\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns are often used as adjectives following the word they modify. They are typically adapted to fit Toki Pona phonology.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Epelanto` – an Esperanto language\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nThe particle **o** has several uses:\n\nUsed before a verb in the predicate, it creates a command or instruction, addressed to the subject (which is often implied \"you\"):\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `sina o pali pona.` – You should work well (a strong suggestion or mild command).\n\nUsed after a subject, it acts as a vocative, directly addressing that person or thing:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Pape! (addressing Pape)\n\nUsed between the subject and predicate (or between `li` and the predicate), it expresses a wish or request concerning the subject:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / Wishing goodness for you.\n- `mi o sona e ni.` – I wish I knew this. / Let me understand this.\n\nThese uses can sometimes be combined, as in `soweli Ton o moku` which can be interpreted as \"Ton the animal, eat!\" (vocative + command) or \"Ton the animal, should eat\" (wish/request).\n\n## Interjections\n\nInterjections are expressive words that can stand alone or be followed by the optional emphatic particle **a**.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `toki!` – Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon a!` – True! / Correct! / Indeed!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / Good meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nQuestions can be formed in several ways:\n\nYes/No questions are commonly formed using the **verb ala verb** structure:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating or not eating? / Are you eating?\n- The answer repeats the verb for \"yes\" (`moku.`) or uses the verb followed by `ala` or just `ala` for \"no\" (`moku ala.` / `ala.`).\n\nGeneral questions can be formed using **seme** (what/which/who/why): Replace the word or phrase in question with **seme**.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Which person is talking? / Who is talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making/doing?\n- `ona li tawa seme?` – Where are they going? (They are going to what?)\n- `tomo sina li suli tan seme?` – Why is your building big? (Your building is big because of what?)\n\nAlternatively, **anu seme** can be added at the end of a statement to turn it into a question equivalent to \"or what?\":\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating or what? / Are you eating?\n- `kala li lon poki anu seme?` – Are fish in the box or what? / Are fish in the box?\n\nThe use of a question mark is a stylistic convention; the grammatical structure of the sentence marks it as a question. Sentence final punctuation typically serves to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nPreverbs are particles or words placed immediately before the main verb in the predicate to add nuance regarding intention, ability, perception, and other aspects of modality or aspect. They function similarly to auxiliary verbs in other languages but do not change form and always precede the main verb.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I learn.\n- `waso lili li wile suli.` – The small bird wants to be big.\n- `sina ken toki e ni.` – You can say this.\n- `ona li lukin pali e tomo.` – They are trying to build a house.\n\nCommon preverbs include: **wile** (want/need), **kama** (come to/become), **sona** (know how to/know about), **lukin** (try/appear to), **ken** (can/be able to), **awen** (continue to/remain), **alasa** (try to find/hunt for).\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\nThe particle **la** is used to mark a preceding phrase or clause as the context or condition for the following main clause. The structure is \"Context la Main_Clause\". This context can relate to time, cause, topic, or any other background information.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are beside me, I feel good. (Context: you being beside me)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night (time of darkness), I sleep. (Context: time of darkness)\n- `mi moku mute la mi pilin pona.` - Because I ate a lot, I feel good. (Context: me eating a lot - indicating cause)\n- `telo la, mi wile jo e ilo pona.` - Regarding water (as context/topic), I want to have a good tool (for handling it).\n\nPrepositional phrases at the end of a sentence can often be moved to the beginning and marked with **la**:\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` is equivalent to `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.`\n- `sina seli tan seme?` can also be phrased as `tan seme la sina seli?` - Because of what are you hot? / Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona uses a base-5 additive system for numbers, combining number words to form larger values.\n\nBasic number words:\n\n- `ala` – zero, nothing (also negation)\n- `wan` – one\n- `tu` – two\n- `luka` – five (hand)\n- `mute` – twenty (many, a lot)\n- `ale` – one hundred, all (also infinity, everything)\n\nNumbers are formed by adding these values:\n\n- `luka wan` = 5 + 1 = 6\n- `luka tu tu` = 5 + 2 + 2 = 9\n- `mute tu wan` = 20 + 2 + 1 = 23\n- `mute mute luka wan` = 20 + 20 + 5 + 1 = 46\n\nFor large numbers, it's common to say `mute mute` for anything substantially over 20, or simply `ale` for a very large quantity.\n\nOrdinals (first, second, etc.) are formed using the word **nanpa** (number) before the number phrase:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – the first person\n- `tomo nanpa tu luka wan` – the eighth building (building number 5+1)\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is the 23rd street (That is street number 20+2+1).",

    "text": "# Toki Pona Logography\n\nLogographs are a system of visual symbols representing Toki Pona words. These symbols aim for simplicity and evoke the meaning of the words they represent while adhering to a consistent visual style.\n\n## Principles\n\n- **Simplicity:** Logographs should be easily recognizable and simple in form, typically using a limited number of strokes or shapes.\n- **Evocation:** The design of a logograph should ideally evoke or hint at the meaning of the word, either directly or metaphorically.\n- **Uniqueness:** Each logograph should be distinct enough from others to avoid confusion, even when rendered with slight variations.\n- **Consistency:** While simple, logographs should ideally adhere to a consistent visual vocabulary (e.g., favoring lines and basic shapes).\n\n## Development Process\n\nNew logographs are developed through consensus, following a process of proposal, discussion, and refinement to ensure they meet the core principles and integrate well with existing symbols.\n\n## Example: Logograph for \"jan\"\n\nThe logograph for \"jan\" represents a person. The design process aimed for simplicity and visual evocation without relying on overly detailed or specific body parts that might be used for other concepts.\n\n- **Initial Concept:** A vertical line for the body, with a small element for the head and potentially lines for feet.\n- **Refinement:** To enhance clarity and uniqueness, a small circle was adopted to represent the head, placed above a vertical line representing the body. Two short lines at the bottom indicate the feet.\n\n| Word | Meaning | Logograph | Description                                        |\n| :--- | :------ | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------- |\n| jan  | person  |           | A small circle above a vertical line with two short lines at the base, resembling a simplified human figure. |\n\n*(Note: The logograph for \"jan\" as described here is illustrative of the development process. Actual logograph designs are subject to community consensus and established visual standards.)*",
