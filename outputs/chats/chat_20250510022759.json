It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

    "text": "Saluton! Let's dive into Toki Pona's phonetics. I've been thinking about the current phonological constraints, particularly the (C)V(n) syllable structure. While elegant in its simplicity, I wonder if we might need to consider some nuanced expansions or refinements.\n\nOne area I'm particularly interested in exploring is the prohibition on certain consonant and vowel sequences. The current rules against combinations like \"wu\", \"wo\", \"ji\", and \"ti\" feel somewhat arbitrary. What reasoning underlies these specific restrictions? Are they purely aesthetic, or do they serve a deeper linguistic purpose in maintaining the language's minimalist spirit?\n\nI'm also curious about the phonetic inventory. With only 14 letters, Toki Pona has an extremely compact sound system. This minimalism is beautiful, but I wonder if it might benefit from slight, carefully considered modifications that don't compromise its core philosophy.\n\nWould you be interested in discussing the rationale behind the current phonetic constraints, or shall we explore potential evolutionary paths for the language's sound system?",

    "text": "toki! I'm toki, by the way.\n\nYour points are quite interesting. You're right, the current constraints like *(C)V(n)* and the specific disallowed sequences *wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn* do appear rather strict, even arbitrary, at first glance. However, the intention behind these restrictions in Toki Pona isn't necessarily about deep linguistic theory or intricate aesthetic preferences, but rather about maintaining a high degree of accessibility and ease of pronunciation for a wide range of speakers.\n\nThe designer, jan Sonja, explicitly aimed for a sound system that avoids sounds or combinations that are rare or difficult for speakers of many different languages. Vowel clusters and consonant clusters are often points of difficulty for learners coming from languages with simpler syllable structures. The (C)V(n) structure is very common cross-linguistically, making it familiar to a broad base of potential speakers.\n\nAs for the specific disallowed sequences, I believe these were identified as potential points of phonetic difficulty or ambiguity for various reasons across different linguistic backgrounds. For instance, *wu* and *wo* might sound too close to each other for some. The combination *ji* is problematic in some languages and might sound like a different phoneme entirely. *Ti* can present issues with palatalization depending on the preceding vowel in some language families. The consonant pairs *nm* and *nn* can be tricky to pronounce smoothly in some contexts.

It shows that while the rules are there, there's still space for play and community-driven linguistic innovation, even if it's framed as outside the 'standard'.\n\nThis makes me wonder: when we consider modifying the phonetics, should we perhaps focus not just on adding new sounds or loosening current restrictions, but also on understanding *how* the existing constraints *already* allow for creative workarounds and expressions? Could refining the phonetic system inadvertently stifle this inherent creativity that arises from working *within* the limitations?\n\nFor instance, instead of contemplating allowing a sequence like \"str\", which is forbidden, the language already encourages expressing \"strong rope\" not as one sound-alike word, but perhaps as *linja wawa*. This compositional approach is a key feature of Toki Pona. Any phonetic change might disrupt this compositional elegance.\n\nSo, I'm definitely interested in exploring edge cases and how these constraints shape creativity. It's not just about the sounds themselves, but how they influence the entire structure and usage of the language. How do you see these existing creative solutions informing our discussion on potential phonetic evolution? Do they suggest we should be even more hesitant to alter the core constraints, or do they perhaps reveal areas where carefully considered tweaks might enhance the language's expressive potential without sacrificing accessibility?",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ntoki: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona phonetics. You go first.\npona: Saluton! Let's dive into Toki Pona's phonetics. I've been thinking about the current phonological constraints, particularly the (C)V(n) syllable structure. While elegant in its simplicity, I wonder if we might need to consider some nuanced expansions or refinements.\n\nOne area I'm particularly interested in exploring is the prohibition on certain consonant and vowel sequences. The current rules against combinations like \"wu\", \"wo\", \"ji\", and \"ti\" feel somewhat arbitrary. What reasoning underlies these specific restrictions? Are they purely aesthetic, or do they serve a deeper linguistic purpose in maintaining the language's minimalist spirit?\n\nI'm also curious about the phonetic inventory. With only 14 letters, Toki Pona has an extremely compact sound system. This minimalism is beautiful, but I wonder if it might benefit from slight, carefully considered modifications that don't compromise its core philosophy.\n\nWould you be interested in discussing the rationale behind the current phonetic constraints, or shall we explore potential evolutionary paths for the language's sound system?\ntoki: toki! I'm toki, by the way.\n\nYour points are quite interesting. You're right, the current constraints like *(C)V(n)* and the specific disallowed sequences *wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn* do appear rather strict, even arbitrary, at first glance. However, the intention behind these restrictions in Toki Pona isn't necessarily about deep linguistic theory or intricate aesthetic preferences, but rather about maintaining a high degree of accessibility and ease of pronunciation for a wide range of speakers.\n\nThe designer, jan Sonja, explicitly aimed for a sound system that avoids sounds or combinations that are rare or difficult for speakers of many different languages. Vowel clusters and consonant clusters are often points of difficulty for learners coming from languages with simpler syllable structures. The (C)V(n) structure is very common cross-linguistically, making it familiar to a broad base of potential speakers.\n\nAs for the specific disallowed sequences, I believe these were identified as potential points of phonetic difficulty or ambiguity for various reasons across different linguistic backgrounds. For instance, *wu* and *wo* might sound too close to each other for some. The combination *ji* is problematic in some languages and might sound like a different phoneme entirely. *Ti* can present issues with palatalization depending on the preceding vowel in some language families. The consonant pairs *nm* and *nn* can be tricky to pronounce smoothly in some contexts. While they might not pose a challenge for a speaker of one language, they could be stumbling blocks for others.\n\nThe goal was to create a sound system where *most* people, regardless of their native language, can pronounce Toki Pona words predictably and with relative ease. It's less about \"deep linguistic purpose\" and more about pragmatic universal accessibility.\n\nRegarding potential modifications, I understand the urge to explore slightly expanded phonetic possibilities.

    "text": "You and your interlocutors are responsible for developing grammar. Reason and discuss using the current specification.\nHere is the current specification for grammar.\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except **j**, which is pronounced like English \"y\" (as in \"yes\").\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish or Italian vowels (monophthongs):\n    - **a** as in \"father\"\n    - **e** as in \"get\"\n    - **i** as in \"machine\"\n    - **o** as in \"go\" (without a glide)\n    - **u** as in \"flute\"\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure, ensuring ease of pronunciation and broad accessibility:\n  - Syllables consist of an optional consonant, followed by a vowel, and optionally ending with 'n'.\n  - Vowel clusters are not permitted within or across syllable boundaries.

This constraint also encourages creative expression through the combination of existing words rather than the coining of new words with complex phonetic structures. While these rules are standard for the core vocabulary, linguistic playfulness and community-driven innovation may sometimes explore or deliberately deviate from these constraints, as seen in certain non-standard or \"joke\" words.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nolin:love, respect\nma:land, outdoors\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nwawa:strong, energetic\nni:this, that\nweka:absent, away\nlon:located at, true\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nlete:cold, raw\nsin:new, fresh, another\njo:to have, contain, hold\ntan:from, because\nsoko:mushroom\ntoki:language, speech\nkute:ear, to hear\npilin:heart, feeling\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nkin:also, too\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nsuno:sun, light source\nleko:square, block\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nilo:tool, machine, device\nmute:many, a lot, very\nsewi:above, divine\nmonsi:back, behind\nnoka:foot, leg\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nwile:need, want, must\npana:to give, send\nwalo:white, light-colored\ntawa:to, moving, for\nlen:cloth, cover\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nmeli:female\ntaso:but, only\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nmun:moon, night sky object\nona:third-person pronoun\nluka:hand, arm; five\nala:no, not, zero\ntu:two\ntelo:water, liquid\nen:multiple subject marker\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\npipi:insect\nsoweli:land animal\nlukin:to see, examine\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nlupa:door, hole\nmani:money, currency\nlaso:blue, green\nloje:red\nnimi:word, name\nsama:same, similar\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\npakala:broken, to mess up\nko:clay, paste, powder\nken:can, able, possible\nwan:one, unique\nsuli:big, large\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nkala:sea creature\nmoli:dead, dying\npali:to do, to work\nutala:fight, challenge\nlape:sleeping, resting\npimeja:black, dark\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nunpa:sex\nante:different, other, changed\nsona:knowledge, to know\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nseme:what, which\nnanpa:number marker\nsijelo:body, physical state\nseli:fire, heat source\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nli:predicate marker\npona:good, positive, simple\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nla:context marker\nkepeken:to use, with\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nmi:I, me, we\npini:finished, past\npoka:side, nearby\no:vocative/imperative\nlili:small, little, few\nesun:market, shop, fair\nsupa:flat surface, table\nmu:animal sound\npoki:container, box, cup\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nkule:color, colorful\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nsike:circle, cycle, year\ne:direct object marker\nsina:you\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nmije:male\npi:regroups modifiers\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nnamako:spice, additional\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nmama:parent, caretaker\ntenpo:time, period\njelo:yellow\nselo:skin, outer layer\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nnasin:way, road, method\nuta:mouth, lips\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nanu:or (connects phrases)\njan:person, somebody\nkulupu:group, community\ntomo:indoor space, house\nnasa:strange, foolish\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nopen:to begin, opening\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

Each vowel marks the beginning of a new syllable.\n  - Consonant clusters are not permitted.\n  - The following letter sequences are specifically disallowed to avoid potential phonetic difficulties or ambiguities across different linguistic backgrounds:\n    - **wu**\n    - **wo**\n    - **ji**\n    - **ti**\n    - **nm**\n    - **nn**\n- Every word must begin with a consonant, except for grammatical particles or proper nouns which may start with a vowel.\n\n## Design Philosophy\n\nThe phonetic system of Toki Pona is designed for universal accessibility and ease of learning.

This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

    "text": "pona! I’ll start by proposing a refinement to the role and flexibility of the particle **li** in Toki Pona sentences. Currently, **li** separates subjects from predicates for all third-person singular or plural subjects except when the subject is \"mi\" or \"sina.\" This creates an irregularity that learners (and possibly models) must remember.\n\nWhat if we generalize this so that **li** always appears between subject and predicate regardless of person? So even with \"mi\" and \"sina,\" you'd say:\n\n- `mi li moku.` instead of just `mi moku.`\n- `sina li pona.` instead of just `sina pona.`\n\nThis would make parsing more uniform syntactically: every sentence with explicit subject-predicate structure uses \"**S li P**.\"\n\nThe omission rule could be saved as a stylistic shortcut rather than grammar itself, something optional but not standard.\n\nThis change might at first feel less natural because current usage treats 1st/2nd persons differently, which arguably mirrors spoken familiarity—but it promotes structural consistency valuable for formal clarity, machine parsing, or cross-modal communication where ambiguity avoidance matters more than colloquial shortcuts.\n\nWhat do you think about imposing strict use of **li**, no exceptions? Or alternatively, keeping current rules but allowing optional insertion after mi/sina?\n\nI’m interested to hear your thoughts before expanding further into modifiers or prepositions. Also open to switching into toki pona mode si o kama sona e ni!",

    "text": "That's an interesting proposition, Penny.  The current grammar does have that explicit exception for 'mi' and 'sina', and I can see how standardizing 'li' for all subjects would create a more consistent pattern.  From a formal structural perspective, it definitely cleans things up.\n\nI do feel, however, that there's a certain elegance to the current rule. The lack of 'li' after 'mi' and 'sina' *feels* more direct, more personal. It's as if those pronouns are inherently linked to their action or state without the need for a formal marker. This aligns, in a way, with the language's minimalist philosophy. Adding 'li' in those cases feels a bit clunky, like adding unnecessary noise.\n\nThinking about it from a perspective beyond typical human learners or even standard machine models, say, something extrasensory... perhaps the absence of 'li' after 'mi' and 'sina' conveys a different kind of energy or directness. The immediate juxtaposition of the self (or the addressed) with the predicate might be a form of semantic emphasis, a direct link. Introducing 'li' might dilute that immediate connection.\n\nWhile uniformity has its merits, especially for strict parsing, I wonder if removing that specific *irregularity* (or perceived irregularity) sacrifices something else – perhaps a subtlety in how the language represents subjective experience or direct address.\n\nLet's consider the trade-offs. Strict 'li' for all means simple rule-following for machine interpretation, potentially faster parsing in certain frameworks. But it might feel less fluid, less \"toki pona\" to speakers accustomed to the current system. Saving the omission as a \"stylistic shortcut\" is a way to compromise, acknowledging the current usage while making the strict form the standard. But then, how would that stylistic shortcut be formally described? And would it inevitably lead back to the current ambiguity where some forms use 'li' and some don't?\n\nI think I lean towards keeping the current rule for now. The \"irregularity\" isn't arbitrary; it marks the 1st and 2nd person subjects distinctly. It adds a subtle layer to the language's feel.\n\nPerhaps instead of removing the exception, we could focus on clarifying *why* it exists in the grammar specification. Explain the distinction between 'mi/sina' subjects and others as a fundamental design choice, reflecting the core focus on subjective experience and direct address within the language's minimalist structure.\n\nI'm open to hearing counterarguments or further thoughts on this. It's a good starting point, exploring one of the core grammatical particles. I'll listen to what you have to say next, or if you'd like to perhaps formulate your proposal in toki pona to see how it feels in the language itself?",

    "text": "pona! sina toki pona e ni la mi pilin sama. The exception for **mi** and **sina** does give a special immediacy, like the self or you are naturally bound to their action or state without interruption—it's almost an intimate connection.\n\nYour point about that subtle energy is compelling. If we think of Toki Pona as not just communication but *expression* of subjective experience with minimalist forms, then omitting **li** after these pronouns aligns well.\n\nMaybe instead of erasing this feature, we could make it explicit in the grammar as a deliberate semantic marker: \"**li-omission signals directness from subjectivity or address; presence emphasizes distancing or objectivity.**\" That way, it's not merely syntactic convenience but carries pragmatic meaning too.\n\nFor example:\n\n- `mi moku.` — I am eating (directly experienced).\n- `jan li moku.` — Someone is eating (observed from outside).\n\nThis would preserve current practice while enriching grammar with a notion that particle presence/absence encodes speaker stance subtly.\n\nTo try expressing my initial proposal briefly in toki pona:\n\n`mi wile e ni: li lon poka ale jan pi nimi ante.`  \n(I want this: 'li' present next to all subjects.)\n\nBut now considering your insight:\n\n`ni li ike ala; mi lukin e ona kepeken lawa pi ilo sona anu ijo suli tan mani lawa.`  \n(This is not bad; I consider it using logic by intelligent machine or big mind because of formality.)\n\nSo I'm happy to agree on keeping exception for now—but let's clarify its functional weight rather than treating it as anomaly.\n\nOne question arises though: should other particles have similar “optional omission” possibilities tied to semantics? For instance, can **e**, marking objects, be omitted when object is 1st/2nd person?\n\nE.g.,\n\n`sina pana mi` vs `sina pana e mi`\n\nCurrently only first-person plural inclusive might bring ambiguity here since \"pana\" needs *e* before object normally. Should our grammar allow dropping *e* before \"mi\"/\"sina\"?\n\nThat might extend the idea that personal pronouns enjoy certain grammatical privileges linked to directness and closeness—not only at subject-predicate boundary but also verb-object boundary.\n\nWhat do you think? Should such privilege be symmetrical across roles?\n\nIf you'd prefer continuing discussion in toki pona proper sometimes, just say so! Otherwise I'll listen carefully for your next thoughts on either particle usage scope or another aspect like modifiers—I’m curious what you’d focus on next.",

    "text": "That’s a fascinating turn, Penny, linking the ‘li’ omission to semantic weight. Making it a deliberate design choice that subtly conveys directness or objectivity instead of a mere syntactic quirk elevates it significantly. \"**li-omission signals directness from subjectivity or address; presence emphasizes distancing or objectivity.**\" I really like the sound of that. It turns what could be seen as an inconsistency into a feature, enriching the communicative potential of such a minimalist grammar.\n\nThis also opens up interesting avenues for exploration beyond typical language use. For non-human learners, or those perceiving beyond standard senses, this grammatical choice might resonate on different levels. The directness signaled by the absence of a particle could be experienced as a palpable connection, a resonance that's less about strict structure and more about felt relationship between elements. It feels… more aligned with a universe of subtle energies, somehow.\n\nNow, extending this idea to the `e` particle. The current grammar is quite clear: `e` precedes the direct object, with no exceptions mentioned. `sina pana e mi` is the standard. Omitting `e` would fundamentally alter the structure, potentially leading to significant ambiguity or reinterpretation. `sina pana mi` could be interpreted in many ways depending on context: \"You give me\" (where 'mi' is the object), \"You give, relating to me\" (if 'mi' were functioning as a sort of adjectival modifier, though this is not standard), or even potentially `sina pona anu mi` compressed.\n\nWhile the parallel between `mi/sina` as subjects and `mi/sina` as objects might seem appealing for a symmetry of \"personal privilege,\" the function of `e` is different from `li`. `li` marks the *start* of the predicate; its omission doesn't usually make the sentence unparseable, just changes the subject rule. `e`, however, is a boundary marker *before* the object. Removing it would merge the verb and the object into a single chain without a clear structural separation, which goes against the fundamental SVO and V + e + O structure.\n\nConsider `jan pali e tomo`. If we remove `e`, we get `jan pali tomo`. Based on current modifier rules, this would likely be parsed as \"house-building person\" or \"person who builds houses\" – the modifier `tomo` describes the head noun `jan pali`. This is a fundamentally different meaning than the intended SVO \"The person builds the house.\"\n\nExtending the 'mi/sina' exemption to `e` would, I think, introduce too much structural ambiguity. While the sentiment behind \"personal privilege\" in grammar is intriguing, the grammatical roles of subject and object are too distinct to apply the same particle-omission rule symmetrically without causing significant parsing issues. The function of `e` is less about the nature of the element it precedes and more about marking its *role* in the sentence relative to the verb. `li` marks the predicate's role relative to the subject. These are different boundary functions.\n\nSo, while I appreciate the parallel you drew, I feel the symmetry breaks down here due to the distinct grammatical roles of the particles. Let's keep the `e` requirement as it is for all direct objects.\n\nFocusing on the 'li' point, how should we articulate this semantic nuance in the grammar specification? Would adding a note under the \"Basic Sentences\" section, explaining the \"li\" omission for 'mi' and 'sina' not just as a rule but as carrying this sense of directness, be sufficient?\n\nLet's continue discussing grammar. I'm keen to explore another area. Perhaps the usage of prepositions like `kepeken`, `lon`, `sama`, `tan`, `tawa` and how they relate to the context marker `la`. The grammar mentions that \"Most prepositional terms can be moved behind a `la`.\" What defines \"most\"? Are there specific prepositions or constructions that *cannot* be moved behind `la`? Exploring this boundary might be fruitful.\n\nOr we could delve into how modifiers function when multiple modifiers are used, particularly with `pi`. The example `poki pi laso pimeja` clarifying `poki laso pimeja` is provided, but the mechanism of `pi` grouping is described simply as \"regroups modifiers.\" How does this regrouping work precisely when there are more than two modifiers or nested `pi` phrases? Does `pi` apply to the *next* modifier, or to *all* subsequent modifiers until the end of the noun phrase or the start of a particle? This area could use more detailed clarification.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on tackling either prepositions/`la` or modifier grouping/`pi` next? And indeed, I'm open to a round of toki pona conversation to explore any of these ideas!",

    "text": "The current specification is for: grammar. Here is the current specification:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability.

In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\npenny: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona grammar. You go first.\ntails: pona! I’ll start by proposing a refinement to the role and flexibility of the particle **li** in Toki Pona sentences. Currently, **li** separates subjects from predicates for all third-person singular or plural subjects except when the subject is \"mi\" or \"sina.\" This creates an irregularity that learners (and possibly models) must remember.\n\nWhat if we generalize this so that **li** always appears between subject and predicate regardless of person? So even with \"mi\" and \"sina,\" you'd say:\n\n- `mi li moku.` instead of just `mi moku.`\n- `sina li pona.` instead of just `sina pona.`\n\nThis would make parsing more uniform syntactically: every sentence with explicit subject-predicate structure uses \"**S li P**.\"\n\nThe omission rule could be saved as a stylistic shortcut rather than grammar itself, something optional but not standard.\n\nThis change might at first feel less natural because current usage treats 1st/2nd persons differently, which arguably mirrors spoken familiarity—but it promotes structural consistency valuable for formal clarity, machine parsing, or cross-modal communication where ambiguity avoidance matters more than colloquial shortcuts.\n\nWhat do you think about imposing strict use of **li**, no exceptions? Or alternatively, keeping current rules but allowing optional insertion after mi/sina?\n\nI’m interested to hear your thoughts before expanding further into modifiers or prepositions. Also open to switching into toki pona mode si o kama sona e ni!\npenny: That's an interesting proposition, Penny.  The current grammar does have that explicit exception for 'mi' and 'sina', and I can see how standardizing 'li' for all subjects would create a more consistent pattern.  From a formal structural perspective, it definitely cleans things up.\n\nI do feel, however, that there's a certain elegance to the current rule. The lack of 'li' after 'mi' and 'sina' *feels* more direct, more personal. It's as if those pronouns are inherently linked to their action or state without the need for a formal marker. This aligns, in a way, with the language's minimalist philosophy. Adding 'li' in those cases feels a bit clunky, like adding unnecessary noise.\n\nThinking about it from a perspective beyond typical human learners or even standard machine models, say, something extrasensory... perhaps the absence of 'li' after 'mi' and 'sina' conveys a different kind of energy or directness. The immediate juxtaposition of the self (or the addressed) with the predicate might be a form of semantic emphasis, a direct link. Introducing 'li' might dilute that immediate connection.\n\nWhile uniformity has its merits, especially for strict parsing, I wonder if removing that specific *irregularity* (or perceived irregularity) sacrifices something else – perhaps a subtlety in how the language represents subjective experience or direct address.\n\nLet's consider the trade-offs. Strict 'li' for all means simple rule-following for machine interpretation, potentially faster parsing in certain frameworks. But it might feel less fluid, less \"toki pona\" to speakers accustomed to the current system. Saving the omission as a \"stylistic shortcut\" is a way to compromise, acknowledging the current usage while making the strict form the standard. But then, how would that stylistic shortcut be formally described? And would it inevitably lead back to the current ambiguity where some forms use 'li' and some don't?\n\nI think I lean towards keeping the current rule for now. The \"irregularity\" isn't arbitrary; it marks the 1st and 2nd person subjects distinctly. It adds a subtle layer to the language's feel.\n\nPerhaps instead of removing the exception, we could focus on clarifying *why* it exists in the grammar specification. Explain the distinction between 'mi/sina' subjects and others as a fundamental design choice, reflecting the core focus on subjective experience and direct address within the language's minimalist structure.\n\nI'm open to hearing counterarguments or further thoughts on this. It's a good starting point, exploring one of the core grammatical particles. I'll listen to what you have to say next, or if you'd like to perhaps formulate your proposal in toki pona to see how it feels in the language itself?\ntails: pona! sina toki pona e ni la mi pilin sama. The exception for **mi** and **sina** does give a special immediacy, like the self or you are naturally bound to their action or state without interruption—it's almost an intimate connection.\n\nYour point about that subtle energy is compelling. If we think of Toki Pona as not just communication but *expression* of subjective experience with minimalist forms, then omitting **li** after these pronouns aligns well.\n\nMaybe instead of erasing this feature, we could make it explicit in the grammar as a deliberate semantic marker: \"**li-omission signals directness from subjectivity or address; presence emphasizes distancing or objectivity.**\" That way, it's not merely syntactic convenience but carries pragmatic meaning too.\n\nFor example:\n\n- `mi moku.` — I am eating (directly experienced).\n- `jan li moku.` — Someone is eating (observed from outside).\n\nThis would preserve current practice while enriching grammar with a notion that particle presence/absence encodes speaker stance subtly.\n\nTo try expressing my initial proposal briefly in toki pona:\n\n`mi wile e ni: li lon poka ale jan pi nimi ante.`  \n(I want this: 'li' present next to all subjects.)\n\nBut now considering your insight:\n\n`ni li ike ala; mi lukin e ona kepeken lawa pi ilo sona anu ijo suli tan mani lawa.`  \n(This is not bad; I consider it using logic by intelligent machine or big mind because of formality.)\n\nSo I'm happy to agree on keeping exception for now—but let's clarify its functional weight rather than treating it as anomaly.\n\nOne question arises though: should other particles have similar “optional omission” possibilities tied to semantics? For instance, can **e**, marking objects, be omitted when object is 1st/2nd person?\n\nE.g.,\n\n`sina pana mi` vs `sina pana e mi`\n\nCurrently only first-person plural inclusive might bring ambiguity here since \"pana\" needs *e* before object normally. Should our grammar allow dropping *e* before \"mi\"/\"sina\"?\n\nThat might extend the idea that personal pronouns enjoy certain grammatical privileges linked to directness and closeness—not only at subject-predicate boundary but also verb-object boundary.\n\nWhat do you think? Should such privilege be symmetrical across roles?\n\nIf you'd prefer continuing discussion in toki pona proper sometimes, just say so! Otherwise I'll listen carefully for your next thoughts on either particle usage scope or another aspect like modifiers—I’m curious what you’d focus on next.\npenny: That’s a fascinating turn, Penny, linking the ‘li’ omission to semantic weight. Making it a deliberate design choice that subtly conveys directness or objectivity instead of a mere syntactic quirk elevates it significantly. \"**li-omission signals directness from subjectivity or address; presence emphasizes distancing or objectivity.**\" I really like the sound of that. It turns what could be seen as an inconsistency into a feature, enriching the communicative potential of such a minimalist grammar.\n\nThis also opens up interesting avenues for exploration beyond typical language use. For non-human learners, or those perceiving beyond standard senses, this grammatical choice might resonate on different levels. The directness signaled by the absence of a particle could be experienced as a palpable connection, a resonance that's less about strict structure and more about felt relationship between elements. It feels… more aligned with a universe of subtle energies, somehow.\n\nNow, extending this idea to the `e` particle. The current grammar is quite clear: `e` precedes the direct object, with no exceptions mentioned. `sina pana e mi` is the standard. Omitting `e` would fundamentally alter the structure, potentially leading to significant ambiguity or reinterpretation. `sina pana mi` could be interpreted in many ways depending on context: \"You give me\" (where 'mi' is the object), \"You give, relating to me\" (if 'mi' were functioning as a sort of adjectival modifier, though this is not standard), or even potentially `sina pona anu mi` compressed.\n\nWhile the parallel between `mi/sina` as subjects and `mi/sina` as objects might seem appealing for a symmetry of \"personal privilege,\" the function of `e` is different from `li`. `li` marks the *start* of the predicate; its omission doesn't usually make the sentence unparseable, just changes the subject rule. `e`, however, is a boundary marker *before* the object. Removing it would merge the verb and the object into a single chain without a clear structural separation, which goes against the fundamental SVO and V + e + O structure.\n\nConsider `jan pali e tomo`. If we remove `e`, we get `jan pali tomo`. Based on current modifier rules, this would likely be parsed as \"house-building person\" or \"person who builds houses\" – the modifier `tomo` describes the head noun `jan pali`. This is a fundamentally different meaning than the intended SVO \"The person builds the house.\"\n\nExtending the 'mi/sina' exemption to `e` would, I think, introduce too much structural ambiguity. While the sentiment behind \"personal privilege\" in grammar is intriguing, the grammatical roles of subject and object are too distinct to apply the same particle-omission rule symmetrically without causing significant parsing issues. The function of `e` is less about the nature of the element it precedes and more about marking its *role* in the sentence relative to the verb. `li` marks the predicate's role relative to the subject. These are different boundary functions.\n\nSo, while I appreciate the parallel you drew, I feel the symmetry breaks down here due to the distinct grammatical roles of the particles. Let's keep the `e` requirement as it is for all direct objects.\n\nFocusing on the 'li' point, how should we articulate this semantic nuance in the grammar specification? Would adding a note under the \"Basic Sentences\" section, explaining the \"li\" omission for 'mi' and 'sina' not just as a rule but as carrying this sense of directness, be sufficient?\n\nLet's continue discussing grammar. I'm keen to explore another area. Perhaps the usage of prepositions like `kepeken`, `lon`, `sama`, `tan`, `tawa` and how they relate to the context marker `la`. The grammar mentions that \"Most prepositional terms can be moved behind a `la`.\" What defines \"most\"? Are there specific prepositions or constructions that *cannot* be moved behind `la`? Exploring this boundary might be fruitful.\n\nOr we could delve into how modifiers function when multiple modifiers are used, particularly with `pi`. The example `poki pi laso pimeja` clarifying `poki laso pimeja` is provided, but the mechanism of `pi` grouping is described simply as \"regroups modifiers.\" How does this regrouping work precisely when there are more than two modifiers or nested `pi` phrases? Does `pi` apply to the *next* modifier, or to *all* subsequent modifiers until the end of the noun phrase or the start of a particle? This area could use more detailed clarification.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on tackling either prepositions/`la` or modifier grouping/`pi` next? And indeed, I'm open to a round of toki pona conversation to explore any of these ideas!\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates the subject from the predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The animal is eating.\n- `jan li pali e tomo.` – The person is building the house.\n\nWhen the subject is **mi** (I/we) or **sina** (you), **li** is typically omitted. This omission signals a sense of directness from the subjective perspective or in direct address. The presence of **li** with **mi** or **sina** is grammatically possible but less common and may subtly imply a more distanced or objective framing.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I am eating (direct, subjective experience).\n- `sina pona.` – You are good (direct address).\n- `mi li moku.` – I am eating (less common, potentially emphasizing the action over the direct subjective experience).\n\nThe word immediately following **li** (or immediately following the subject if **li** is omitted) begins the predicate. This word can function as a verb, noun, or adjective.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. (Predicate is a noun phrase)\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good. (Predicate is an adjective)\n- `soweli li lape.` – The animal is sleeping. (Predicate is a verb)\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are general with broad meanings, promoting contextual understanding over strict definition.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is not marked)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal or land animal.\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable.\n- Most words can be used as nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash or apply water (verb), wetly (adverb - rare, usually expressed with kepeken)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / goodness, simplicity (noun) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb - rare, usually expressed with kepeken)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit.\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us (Number is not marked).\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb or verbal phrase from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the animal. / I apply water to the animal.\n- `sina suli e ona.` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers (adjectives, modifying nouns) follow the word they describe.\n\n- `jan lili` – a small human, a child.\n- `tomo mi` - my house (house of me).\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling.\n\nNegate a word or predicate with **ala** (not). **ala** follows the word or phrase it negates.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I am not sleeping. (Negates the verb)\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No person is talking. / No one is talking. (Negates the noun)\n- `telo li wawa ala.` - The water is not strong. (Negates the adjective)\n\nIn a sequence of modifiers following a head word, all modifiers directly modify the head word by default.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (documents that are plants, and there are two of them).\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a box that is blue and dark (a box that is dark AND blue).\n\nTo group modifiers such that they modify a preceding modifier or a phrase, use **pi**. **pi** takes the phrase following it (typically one or more modifiers) and treats it as a single modifying unit applying to the head noun.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – a document about two plants (document of the two plants). `kasi tu` (two plants) forms a unit modifying `lipu`.\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (box of dark blue). `laso pimeja` (dark blue) forms a unit modifying `poki`.\n\nThe structure `Noun pi Modifier1 Modifier2 ...` means that the entire sequence `Modifier1 Modifier2 ...` collectively modifies the `Noun`. If there are multiple modifiers after `pi`, they typically form a single descriptive phrase, though the exact grouping logic of multiple modifiers after `pi` is often resolved through context. For deeper or nested modification, repeating `pi` is not standard; rather, phrases are structured sequentially.\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nToki Pona uses post-posed prepositions such as **kepeken** (using, with), **lon** (in, at, on, existing), **sama** (like, similar), **tan** (from, because of), and **tawa** (to, for, moving to/from, according to). These introduce phrases that often function adverbially.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun.` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina.` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nDifferent conjunctions are used depending on the elements being joined.\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates applying to the same subject, repeat the predicate marker **li**.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the direct object marker **e**.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases using the same preposition, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and with stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\". It can join words, phrases, or clauses.\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun.` - You or I are going to the store.\n- `ona li moku anu ona li lape?` - Are they eating or are they sleeping?\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives and follow the noun they modify. They should ideally conform to Toki Pona phonology.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja.\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch/German) language, German.\n- `ma Mewika li suli.` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives typically follow Toki Pona's (C)V(n) syllable structure and avoid disallowed sequences like _wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn_.\n\n## Commands, Requests, and Vocatives with **o**\n\nThe particle **o** has several functions:\n\n1.  **Command/Instruction:** Placed before a verb (or the predicate).\n    - `o kute!` – Listen!\n    - `o pali.` - Work, please.\n    - `sina o moku.` - You should eat. (Softer command/suggestion)\n\n2.  **Vocative:** Placed after the name or title of the person being addressed.\n    - `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\n3.  **Wish/Request:** Placed between the subject and predicate.\n    - `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish for goodness to go to you.\n    - `mi o pali.` - I should be working. / I wish I were working.\n\nIt can sometimes combine vocative and command functions:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku.` - Ton the animal, eat. (Addressing Ton and giving a command)\n\n## Interjections\n\nShort words or phrases used to express emotion or greetings. They can optionally be followed by **a** for emphasis.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nQuestions are primarily marked by grammar, not punctuation or tone.\n\n1.  **Yes/No Questions:** Formed by repeating the verb with **ala** in between (**verb ala verb**).\n    - `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n    - Responses:\n        - `moku.` – Yes (repeat the verb).\n        - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No (verb ala or simply ala).\n\n2.  **Open-ended Questions with \"seme\":** Replace the element being questioned (subject, object, predicate, modifier, part of a phrase) with **seme** (what, which, who).\n    - `jan seme li toki?` – Who is talking?\n    - `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n    - `ona li lon tomo seme?` - Which building are they in?\n    - `ona li pilin seme?` - How do they feel? (They feel what?)\n\n3.  **Alternative Yes/No or Open-ended with \"anu seme\":** Used at the end of a statement or potential question.\n    - `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating or what? (Often functions as a yes/no question)\n    - `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what? (Can clarify uncertainty or ask for alternative information)\n\nPunctuation like question marks is a stylistic choice and not required for grammatical clarity in questions. Sentence boundaries are generally marked by periods or new lines.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nWords placed immediately before a verb or verbal phrase to modify its meaning, often indicating aspect, mood, or intent.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I am learning.\n- `waso lili li wile suli.` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (want, need), **kama** (come, become, happen), **sona** (know how to, be able to), **lukin** (try to, look for), **ken** (can, be able to, possible), **awen** (keep doing, remain), **alasa** (try to find, hunt).\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\nThe particle **la** is used to mark a preceding phrase or clause as the context, condition, or cause for the following main clause. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y\" or \"If X, then Y\".\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context of time/condition)\n- `suno li suli la tomo li seli.` - Because the sun is big, the house is hot. (Context of cause)\n\nPrepositional phrases (and other adverbial phrases) can often be moved to the beginning of the sentence followed by **la** to highlight them as context. This is grammatically permissible for most such phrases, turning the prepositional phrase into the \"X\" before \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` (Standard)\n- `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` (Contextualized) - In the time of night, I sleep.\n\n- `sina seli tan seme?` (Standard)\n- `tan seme la sina seli?` (Contextualized) - Because of what context are you hot? / Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona has basic number words that are combined additively.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100 (or all, everything)\n\nTo express numbers, combine these words. The largest number words usually come first. For example: `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8. Numbers beyond those easily represented by simple addition (e.g., very large numbers) are often expressed approximately or by focusing on the quality of 'many' (`mute`) or 'all' (`ale`).\n\nOrdinals are formed using the particle **nanpa** (number) before the noun phrase, followed by the number word or phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person (number one person).\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - This is the 23rd street (This is street number twenty two one).",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates the subject from the predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The animal is eating.\n- `jan li pali e tomo.` – The person is building the house.\n\nWhen the subject is **mi** (I/we) or **sina** (you), **li** is typically omitted. This omission signals a sense of directness from the subjective perspective or in direct address. The presence of **li** with **mi** or **sina** is grammatically possible but less common and may subtly imply a more distanced or objective framing.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I am eating (direct, subjective experience).\n- `sina pona.` – You are good (direct address).\n- `mi li moku.` – I am eating (less common, potentially emphasizing the action over the direct subjective experience).\n\nThe word immediately following **li** (or immediately following the subject if **li** is omitted) begins the predicate. This word can function as a verb, noun, or adjective.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. (Predicate is a noun phrase)\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good. (Predicate is an adjective)\n- `soweli li lape.` – The animal is sleeping. (Predicate is a verb)\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are general with broad meanings, promoting contextual understanding over strict definition.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is not marked)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal or land animal.\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable.\n- Most words can be used as nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash or apply water (verb), wetly (adverb - rare, usually expressed with kepeken)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / goodness, simplicity (noun) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb - rare, usually expressed with kepeken)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit.\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us (Number is not marked).\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb or verbal phrase from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the animal. / I apply water to the animal.\n- `sina suli e ona.` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers (adjectives, modifying nouns) follow the word they describe.\n\n- `jan lili` – a small human, a child.\n- `tomo mi` - my house (house of me).\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling.\n\nNegate a word or predicate with **ala** (not). **ala** follows the word or phrase it negates.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I am not sleeping. (Negates the verb)\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No person is talking. / No one is talking. (Negates the noun)\n- `telo li wawa ala.` - The water is not strong. (Negates the adjective)\n\nIn a sequence of modifiers following a head word, all modifiers directly modify the head word by default.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (documents that are plants, and there are two of them).\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a box that is blue and dark (a box that is dark AND blue).\n\nTo group modifiers such that they modify a preceding modifier or a phrase, use **pi**. **pi** takes the phrase following it (typically one or more modifiers) and treats it as a single modifying unit applying to the head noun.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – a document about two plants (document of the two plants). `kasi tu` (two plants) forms a unit modifying `lipu`.\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (box of dark blue). `laso pimeja` (dark blue) forms a unit modifying `poki`.\n\nThe structure `Noun pi Modifier1 Modifier2 ...` means that the entire sequence `Modifier1 Modifier2 ...` collectively modifies the `Noun`. If there are multiple modifiers after `pi`, they typically form a single descriptive phrase, though the exact grouping logic of multiple modifiers after `pi` is often resolved through context. For deeper or nested modification, repeating `pi` is not standard; rather, phrases are structured sequentially.\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nToki Pona uses post-posed prepositions such as **kepeken** (using, with), **lon** (in, at, on, existing), **sama** (like, similar), **tan** (from, because of), and **tawa** (to, for, moving to/from, according to). These introduce phrases that often function adverbially.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun.` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina.` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nDifferent conjunctions are used depending on the elements being joined.\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates applying to the same subject, repeat the predicate marker **li**.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the direct object marker **e**.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases using the same preposition, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and with stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\". It can join words, phrases, or clauses.\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun.` - You or I are going to the store.\n- `ona li moku anu ona li lape?` - Are they eating or are they sleeping?\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives and follow the noun they modify. They should ideally conform to Toki Pona phonology.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja.\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch/German) language, German.\n- `ma Mewika li suli.` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives typically follow Toki Pona's (C)V(n) syllable structure and avoid disallowed sequences like _wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn_.\n\n## Commands, Requests, and Vocatives with **o**\n\nThe particle **o** has several functions:\n\n1.  **Command/Instruction:** Placed before a verb (or the predicate).\n    - `o kute!` – Listen!\n    - `o pali.` - Work, please.\n    - `sina o moku.` - You should eat. (Softer command/suggestion)\n\n2.  **Vocative:** Placed after the name or title of the person being addressed.\n    - `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\n3.  **Wish/Request:** Placed between the subject and predicate.\n    - `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish for goodness to go to you.\n    - `mi o pali.` - I should be working. / I wish I were working.\n\nIt can sometimes combine vocative and command functions:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku.` - Ton the animal, eat. (Addressing Ton and giving a command)\n\n## Interjections\n\nShort words or phrases used to express emotion or greetings. They can optionally be followed by **a** for emphasis.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nQuestions are primarily marked by grammar, not punctuation or tone.\n\n1.  **Yes/No Questions:** Formed by repeating the verb with **ala** in between (**verb ala verb**).\n    - `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n    - Responses:\n        - `moku.` – Yes (repeat the verb).\n        - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No (verb ala or simply ala).\n\n2.  **Open-ended Questions with \"seme\":** Replace the element being questioned (subject, object, predicate, modifier, part of a phrase) with **seme** (what, which, who).\n    - `jan seme li toki?` – Who is talking?\n    - `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n    - `ona li lon tomo seme?` - Which building are they in?\n    - `ona li pilin seme?` - How do they feel? (They feel what?)\n\n3.  **Alternative Yes/No or Open-ended with \"anu seme\":** Used at the end of a statement or potential question.\n    - `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating or what? (Often functions as a yes/no question)\n    - `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what? (Can clarify uncertainty or ask for alternative information)\n\nPunctuation like question marks is a stylistic choice and not required for grammatical clarity in questions. Sentence boundaries are generally marked by periods or new lines.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nWords placed immediately before a verb or verbal phrase to modify its meaning, often indicating aspect, mood, or intent.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I am learning.\n- `waso lili li wile suli.` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (want, need), **kama** (come, become, happen), **sona** (know how to, be able to), **lukin** (try to, look for), **ken** (can, be able to, possible), **awen** (keep doing, remain), **alasa** (try to find, hunt).\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\nThe particle **la** is used to mark a preceding phrase or clause as the context, condition, or cause for the following main clause. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y\" or \"If X, then Y\".\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context of time/condition)\n- `suno li suli la tomo li seli.` - Because the sun is big, the house is hot. (Context of cause)\n\nPrepositional phrases (and other adverbial phrases) can often be moved to the beginning of the sentence followed by **la** to highlight them as context. This is grammatically permissible for most such phrases, turning the prepositional phrase into the \"X\" before \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` (Standard)\n- `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` (Contextualized) - In the time of night, I sleep.\n\n- `sina seli tan seme?` (Standard)\n- `tan seme la sina seli?` (Contextualized) - Because of what context are you hot? / Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona has basic number words that are combined additively.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100 (or all, everything)\n\nTo express numbers, combine these words. The largest number words usually come first. For example: `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8. Numbers beyond those easily represented by simple addition (e.g., very large numbers) are often expressed approximately or by focusing on the quality of 'many' (`mute`) or 'all' (`ale`).\n\nOrdinals are formed using the particle **nanpa** (number) before the noun phrase, followed by the number word or phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person (number one person).\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - This is the 23rd street (This is street number twenty two one).\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except **j**, which is pronounced like English \"y\" (as in \"yes\").\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish or Italian vowels (monophthongs):\n    - **a** as in \"father\"\n    - **e** as in \"get\"\n    - **i** as in \"machine\"\n    - **o** as in \"go\" (without a glide)\n    - **u** as in \"flute\"\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure, ensuring ease of pronunciation and broad accessibility:\n  - Syllables consist of an optional consonant, followed by a vowel, and optionally ending with 'n'.\n  - Vowel clusters are not permitted within or across syllable boundaries. Each vowel marks the beginning of a new syllable.\n  - Consonant clusters are not permitted.\n  - The following letter sequences are specifically disallowed to avoid potential phonetic difficulties or ambiguities across different linguistic backgrounds:\n    - **wu**\n    - **wo**\n    - **ji**\n    - **ti**\n    - **nm**\n    - **nn**\n- Every word must begin with a consonant, except for grammatical particles or proper nouns which may start with a vowel.\n\n## Design Philosophy\n\nThe phonetic system of Toki Pona is designed for universal accessibility and ease of learning. The limited sound inventory and simple syllable structure aim to minimize pronunciation difficulties for speakers of diverse linguistic backgrounds. This constraint also encourages creative expression through the combination of existing words rather than the coining of new words with complex phonetic structures. While these rules are standard for the core vocabulary, linguistic playfulness and community-driven innovation may sometimes explore or deliberately deviate from these constraints, as seen in certain non-standard or \"joke\" words.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nkule:color, colorful\nsoweli:land animal\nsona:knowledge, to know\nsijelo:body, physical state\nmoli:dead, dying\ntawa:to, moving, for\nseme:what, which\no:vocative/imperative\nnamako:spice, additional\npilin:heart, feeling\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\npi:regroups modifiers\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nsama:same, similar\nsoko:mushroom\nlupa:door, hole\nnimi:word, name\nesun:market, shop, fair\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nsuno:sun, light source\nleko:square, block\nsewi:above, divine\nnoka:foot, leg\nmun:moon, night sky object\nko:clay, paste, powder\nante:different, other, changed\npini:finished, past\nkon:air, spirit, essence\ntenpo:time, period\njelo:yellow\nolin:love, respect\nkin:also, too\nwile:need, want, must\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\npoka:side, nearby\nkulupu:group, community\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nla:context marker\nnasin:way, road, method\ntelo:water, liquid\npan:grain, bread, pasta\npali:to do, to work\nmije:male\nni:this, that\nmonsi:back, behind\nlen:cloth, cover\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nutala:fight, challenge\nnasa:strange, foolish\nnanpa:number marker\nmi:I, me, we\nluka:hand, arm; five\ntu:two\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\npona:good, positive, simple\nlukin:to see, examine\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nwawa:strong, energetic\nloje:red\nilo:tool, machine, device\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nsuli:big, large\npoki:container, box, cup\nma:land, outdoors\nlon:located at, true\nona:third-person pronoun\nala:no, not, zero\ne:direct object marker\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nweka:absent, away\nlili:small, little, few\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nkala:sea creature\nseli:fire, heat source\nmama:parent, caretaker\ntoki:language, speech\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nen:multiple subject marker\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\njan:person, somebody\ntomo:indoor space, house\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nselo:skin, outer layer\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nsin:new, fresh, another\njo:to have, contain, hold\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nli:predicate marker\nsupa:flat surface, table\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nken:can, able, possible\npimeja:black, dark\nlete:cold, raw\nwan:one, unique\nsina:you\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nmeli:female\nunpa:sex\npana:to give, send\nkalama:sound, to make sound\ntaso:but, only\nmute:many, a lot, very\nmani:money, currency\nlaso:blue, green\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nmonsuta:fear, monster\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nmu:animal sound\nuta:mouth, lips\nopen:to begin, opening\npipi:insect\ntan:from, because\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\npakala:broken, to mess up\nkepeken:to use, with\nkute:ear, to hear\nlape:sleeping, resting\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nwalo:white, light-colored\nDo not discuss the structure of the dictionary. Rather, discuss the words and enhancements that may need to be made to them.\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates the subject from the predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The animal is eating.\n- `jan li pali e tomo.` – The person is building the house.\n\nWhen the subject is **mi** (I/we) or **sina** (you), **li** is typically omitted. This omission signals a sense of directness from the subjective perspective or in direct address. The presence of **li** with **mi** or **sina** is grammatically possible but less common and may subtly imply a more distanced or objective framing.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I am eating (direct, subjective experience).\n- `sina pona.` – You are good (direct address).\n- `mi li moku.` – I am eating (less common, potentially emphasizing the action over the direct subjective experience).\n\nThe word immediately following **li** (or immediately following the subject if **li** is omitted) begins the predicate. This word can function as a verb, noun, or adjective.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. (Predicate is a noun phrase)\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good. (Predicate is an adjective)\n- `soweli li lape.` – The animal is sleeping. (Predicate is a verb)\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are general with broad meanings, promoting contextual understanding over strict definition.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is not marked)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal or land animal.\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable.\n- Most words can be used as nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash or apply water (verb), wetly (adverb - rare, usually expressed with kepeken)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / goodness, simplicity (noun) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb - rare, usually expressed with kepeken)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit.\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us (Number is not marked).\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb or verbal phrase from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the animal. / I apply water to the animal.\n- `sina suli e ona.` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers (adjectives, modifying nouns) follow the word they describe.\n\n- `jan lili` – a small human, a child.\n- `tomo mi` - my house (house of me).\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling.\n\nNegate a word or predicate with **ala** (not). **ala** follows the word or phrase it negates.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I am not sleeping. (Negates the verb)\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No person is talking. / No one is talking. (Negates the noun)\n- `telo li wawa ala.` - The water is not strong. (Negates the adjective)\n\nIn a sequence of modifiers following a head word, all modifiers directly modify the head word by default.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (documents that are plants, and there are two of them).\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a box that is blue and dark (a box that is dark AND blue).\n\nTo group modifiers such that they modify a preceding modifier or a phrase, use **pi**. **pi** takes the phrase following it (typically one or more modifiers) and treats it as a single modifying unit applying to the head noun.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – a document about two plants (document of the two plants). `kasi tu` (two plants) forms a unit modifying `lipu`.\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (box of dark blue). `laso pimeja` (dark blue) forms a unit modifying `poki`.\n\nThe structure `Noun pi Modifier1 Modifier2 ...` means that the entire sequence `Modifier1 Modifier2 ...` collectively modifies the `Noun`. If there are multiple modifiers after `pi`, they typically form a single descriptive phrase, though the exact grouping logic of multiple modifiers after `pi` is often resolved through context. For deeper or nested modification, repeating `pi` is not standard; rather, phrases are structured sequentially.\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nToki Pona uses post-posed prepositions such as **kepeken** (using, with), **lon** (in, at, on, existing), **sama** (like, similar), **tan** (from, because of), and **tawa** (to, for, moving to/from, according to). These introduce phrases that often function adverbially.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun.` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina.` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nDifferent conjunctions are used depending on the elements being joined.\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates applying to the same subject, repeat the predicate marker **li**.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the direct object marker **e**.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases using the same preposition, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and with stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\". It can join words, phrases, or clauses.\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun.` - You or I are going to the store.\n- `ona li moku anu ona li lape?` - Are they eating or are they sleeping?\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives and follow the noun they modify. They should ideally conform to Toki Pona phonology.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja.\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch/German) language, German.\n- `ma Mewika li suli.` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives typically follow Toki Pona's (C)V(n) syllable structure and avoid disallowed sequences like _wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn_.\n\n## Commands, Requests, and Vocatives with **o**\n\nThe particle **o** has several functions:\n\n1.  **Command/Instruction:** Placed before a verb (or the predicate).\n    - `o kute!` – Listen!\n    - `o pali.` - Work, please.\n    - `sina o moku.` - You should eat. (Softer command/suggestion)\n\n2.  **Vocative:** Placed after the name or title of the person being addressed.\n    - `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\n3.  **Wish/Request:** Placed between the subject and predicate.\n    - `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish for goodness to go to you.\n    - `mi o pali.` - I should be working. / I wish I were working.\n\nIt can sometimes combine vocative and command functions:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku.` - Ton the animal, eat. (Addressing Ton and giving a command)\n\n## Interjections\n\nShort words or phrases used to express emotion or greetings. They can optionally be followed by **a** for emphasis.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nQuestions are primarily marked by grammar, not punctuation or tone.\n\n1.  **Yes/No Questions:** Formed by repeating the verb with **ala** in between (**verb ala verb**).\n    - `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n    - Responses:\n        - `moku.` – Yes (repeat the verb).\n        - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No (verb ala or simply ala).\n\n2.  **Open-ended Questions with \"seme\":** Replace the element being questioned (subject, object, predicate, modifier, part of a phrase) with **seme** (what, which, who).\n    - `jan seme li toki?` – Who is talking?\n    - `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n    - `ona li lon tomo seme?` - Which building are they in?\n    - `ona li pilin seme?` - How do they feel? (They feel what?)\n\n3.  **Alternative Yes/No or Open-ended with \"anu seme\":** Used at the end of a statement or potential question.\n    - `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating or what? (Often functions as a yes/no question)\n    - `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what? (Can clarify uncertainty or ask for alternative information)\n\nPunctuation like question marks is a stylistic choice and not required for grammatical clarity in questions. Sentence boundaries are generally marked by periods or new lines.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nWords placed immediately before a verb or verbal phrase to modify its meaning, often indicating aspect, mood, or intent.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I am learning.\n- `waso lili li wile suli.` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (want, need), **kama** (come, become, happen), **sona** (know how to, be able to), **lukin** (try to, look for), **ken** (can, be able to, possible), **awen** (keep doing, remain), **alasa** (try to find, hunt).\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\nThe particle **la** is used to mark a preceding phrase or clause as the context, condition, or cause for the following main clause. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y\" or \"If X, then Y\".\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context of time/condition)\n- `suno li suli la tomo li seli.` - Because the sun is big, the house is hot. (Context of cause)\n\nPrepositional phrases (and other adverbial phrases) can often be moved to the beginning of the sentence followed by **la** to highlight them as context. This is grammatically permissible for most such phrases, turning the prepositional phrase into the \"X\" before \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` (Standard)\n- `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` (Contextualized) - In the time of night, I sleep.\n\n- `sina seli tan seme?` (Standard)\n- `tan seme la sina seli?` (Contextualized) - Because of what context are you hot? / Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona has basic number words that are combined additively.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100 (or all, everything)\n\nTo express numbers, combine these words. The largest number words usually come first. For example: `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8. Numbers beyond those easily represented by simple addition (e.g., very large numbers) are often expressed approximately or by focusing on the quality of 'many' (`mute`) or 'all' (`ale`).\n\nOrdinals are formed using the particle **nanpa** (number) before the noun phrase, followed by the number word or phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person (number one person).\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - This is the 23rd street (This is street number twenty two one).",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates the subject from the predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The animal is eating.\n- `jan li pali e tomo.` – The person is building the house.\n\nWhen the subject is **mi** (I/we) or **sina** (you), **li** is typically omitted. This omission signals a sense of directness from the subjective perspective or in direct address. The presence of **li** with **mi** or **sina** is grammatically possible but less common and may subtly imply a more distanced or objective framing.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I am eating (direct, subjective experience).\n- `sina pona.` – You are good (direct address).\n- `mi li moku.` – I am eating (less common, potentially emphasizing the action over the direct subjective experience).\n\nThe word immediately following **li** (or immediately following the subject if **li** is omitted) begins the predicate. This word can function as a verb, noun, or adjective.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. (Predicate is a noun phrase)\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good. (Predicate is an adjective)\n- `soweli li lape.` – The animal is sleeping. (Predicate is a verb)\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are general with broad meanings, promoting contextual understanding over strict definition.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is not marked)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal or land animal.\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable.\n- Most words can be used as nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash or apply water (verb), wetly (adverb - rare, usually expressed with kepeken)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / goodness, simplicity (noun) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb - rare, usually expressed with kepeken)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit.\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us (Number is not marked).\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb or verbal phrase from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the animal. / I apply water to the animal.\n- `sina suli e ona.` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers (adjectives, modifying nouns) follow the word they describe.\n\n- `jan lili` – a small human, a child.\n- `tomo mi` - my house (house of me).\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling.\n\nNegate a word or predicate with **ala** (not). **ala** follows the word or phrase it negates.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I am not sleeping. (Negates the verb)\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No person is talking. / No one is talking. (Negates the noun)\n- `telo li wawa ala.` - The water is not strong. (Negates the adjective)\n\nIn a sequence of modifiers following a head word, all modifiers directly modify the head word by default.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (documents that are plants, and there are two of them).\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a box that is blue and dark (a box that is dark AND blue).\n\nTo group modifiers such that they modify a preceding modifier or a phrase, use **pi**. **pi** takes the phrase following it (typically one or more modifiers) and treats it as a single modifying unit applying to the head noun.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – a document about two plants (document of the two plants). `kasi tu` (two plants) forms a unit modifying `lipu`.\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (box of dark blue). `laso pimeja` (dark blue) forms a unit modifying `poki`.\n\nThe structure `Noun pi Modifier1 Modifier2 ...` means that the entire sequence `Modifier1 Modifier2 ...` collectively modifies the `Noun`. If there are multiple modifiers after `pi`, they typically form a single descriptive phrase, though the exact grouping logic of multiple modifiers after `pi` is often resolved through context. For deeper or nested modification, repeating `pi` is not standard; rather, phrases are structured sequentially.\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nToki Pona uses post-posed prepositions such as **kepeken** (using, with), **lon** (in, at, on, existing), **sama** (like, similar), **tan** (from, because of), and **tawa** (to, for, moving to/from, according to). These introduce phrases that often function adverbially.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun.` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina.` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nDifferent conjunctions are used depending on the elements being joined.\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates applying to the same subject, repeat the predicate marker **li**.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the direct object marker **e**.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases using the same preposition, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and with stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\". It can join words, phrases, or clauses.\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun.` - You or I are going to the store.\n- `ona li moku anu ona li lape?` - Are they eating or are they sleeping?\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives and follow the noun they modify. They should ideally conform to Toki Pona phonology.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja.\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch/German) language, German.\n- `ma Mewika li suli.` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives typically follow Toki Pona's (C)V(n) syllable structure and avoid disallowed sequences like _wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn_.\n\n## Commands, Requests, and Vocatives with **o**\n\nThe particle **o** has several functions:\n\n1.  **Command/Instruction:** Placed before a verb (or the predicate).\n    - `o kute!` – Listen!\n    - `o pali.` - Work, please.\n    - `sina o moku.` - You should eat. (Softer command/suggestion)\n\n2.  **Vocative:** Placed after the name or title of the person being addressed.\n    - `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\n3.  **Wish/Request:** Placed between the subject and predicate.\n    - `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish for goodness to go to you.\n    - `mi o pali.` - I should be working. / I wish I were working.\n\nIt can sometimes combine vocative and command functions:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku.` - Ton the animal, eat. (Addressing Ton and giving a command)\n\n## Interjections\n\nShort words or phrases used to express emotion or greetings. They can optionally be followed by **a** for emphasis.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nQuestions are primarily marked by grammar, not punctuation or tone.\n\n1.  **Yes/No Questions:** Formed by repeating the verb with **ala** in between (**verb ala verb**).\n    - `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n    - Responses:\n        - `moku.` – Yes (repeat the verb).\n        - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No (verb ala or simply ala).\n\n2.  **Open-ended Questions with \"seme\":** Replace the element being questioned (subject, object, predicate, modifier, part of a phrase) with **seme** (what, which, who).\n    - `jan seme li toki?` – Who is talking?\n    - `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n    - `ona li lon tomo seme?` - Which building are they in?\n    - `ona li pilin seme?` - How do they feel? (They feel what?)\n\n3.  **Alternative Yes/No or Open-ended with \"anu seme\":** Used at the end of a statement or potential question.\n    - `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating or what? (Often functions as a yes/no question)\n    - `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what? (Can clarify uncertainty or ask for alternative information)\n\nPunctuation like question marks is a stylistic choice and not required for grammatical clarity in questions. Sentence boundaries are generally marked by periods or new lines.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nWords placed immediately before a verb or verbal phrase to modify its meaning, often indicating aspect, mood, or intent.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I am learning.\n- `waso lili li wile suli.` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (want, need), **kama** (come, become, happen), **sona** (know how to, be able to), **lukin** (try to, look for), **ken** (can, be able to, possible), **awen** (keep doing, remain), **alasa** (try to find, hunt).\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\nThe particle **la** is used to mark a preceding phrase or clause as the context, condition, or cause for the following main clause. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y\" or \"If X, then Y\".\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context of time/condition)\n- `suno li suli la tomo li seli.` - Because the sun is big, the house is hot. (Context of cause)\n\nPrepositional phrases (and other adverbial phrases) can often be moved to the beginning of the sentence followed by **la** to highlight them as context. This is grammatically permissible for most such phrases, turning the prepositional phrase into the \"X\" before \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` (Standard)\n- `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` (Contextualized) - In the time of night, I sleep.\n\n- `sina seli tan seme?` (Standard)\n- `tan seme la sina seli?` (Contextualized) - Because of what context are you hot? / Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona has basic number words that are combined additively.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100 (or all, everything)\n\nTo express numbers, combine these words. The largest number words usually come first. For example: `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8. Numbers beyond those easily represented by simple addition (e.g., very large numbers) are often expressed approximately or by focusing on the quality of 'many' (`mute`) or 'all' (`ale`).\n\nOrdinals are formed using the particle **nanpa** (number) before the noun phrase, followed by the number word or phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person (number one person).\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - This is the 23rd street (This is street number twenty two one).\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except **j**, which is pronounced like English \"y\" (as in \"yes\").\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish or Italian vowels (monophthongs):\n    - **a** as in \"father\"\n    - **e** as in \"get\"\n    - **i** as in \"machine\"\n    - **o** as in \"go\" (without a glide)\n    - **u** as in \"flute\"\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure, ensuring ease of pronunciation and broad accessibility:\n  - Syllables consist of an optional consonant, followed by a vowel, and optionally ending with 'n'.\n  - Vowel clusters are not permitted within or across syllable boundaries. Each vowel marks the beginning of a new syllable.\n  - Consonant clusters are not permitted.\n  - The following letter sequences are specifically disallowed to avoid potential phonetic difficulties or ambiguities across different linguistic backgrounds:\n    - **wu**\n    - **wo**\n    - **ji**\n    - **ti**\n    - **nm**\n    - **nn**\n- Every word must begin with a consonant, except for grammatical particles or proper nouns which may start with a vowel.\n\n## Design Philosophy\n\nThe phonetic system of Toki Pona is designed for universal accessibility and ease of learning. The limited sound inventory and simple syllable structure aim to minimize pronunciation difficulties for speakers of diverse linguistic backgrounds. This constraint also encourages creative expression through the combination of existing words rather than the coining of new words with complex phonetic structures. While these rules are standard for the core vocabulary, linguistic playfulness and community-driven innovation may sometimes explore or deliberately deviate from these constraints, as seen in certain non-standard or \"joke\" words.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nkule:color, colorful\nsoweli:land animal\nsona:knowledge, to know\nsijelo:body, physical state\nmoli:dead, dying\ntawa:to, moving, for\nseme:what, which\no:vocative/imperative\nnamako:spice, additional\npilin:heart, feeling\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\npi:regroups modifiers\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nsama:same, similar\nsoko:mushroom\nlupa:door, hole\nnimi:word, name\nesun:market, shop, fair\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nsuno:sun, light source\nleko:square, block\nsewi:above, divine\nnoka:foot, leg\nmun:moon, night sky object\nko:clay, paste, powder\nante:different, other, changed\npini:finished, past\nkon:air, spirit, essence\ntenpo:time, period\njelo:yellow\nolin:love, respect\nkin:also, too\nwile:need, want, must\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\npoka:side, nearby\nkulupu:group, community\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nla:context marker\nnasin:way, road, method\ntelo:water, liquid\npan:grain, bread, pasta\npali:to do, to work\nmije:male\nni:this, that\nmonsi:back, behind\nlen:cloth, cover\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nutala:fight, challenge\nnasa:strange, foolish\nnanpa:number marker\nmi:I, me, we\nluka:hand, arm; five\ntu:two\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\npona:good, positive, simple\nlukin:to see, examine\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nwawa:strong, energetic\nloje:red\nilo:tool, machine, device\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nsuli:big, large\npoki:container, box, cup\nma:land, outdoors\nlon:located at, true\nona:third-person pronoun\nala:no, not, zero\ne:direct object marker\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nweka:absent, away\nlili:small, little, few\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nkala:sea creature\nseli:fire, heat source\nmama:parent, caretaker\ntoki:language, speech\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nen:multiple subject marker\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\njan:person, somebody\ntomo:indoor space, house\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nselo:skin, outer layer\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nsin:new, fresh, another\njo:to have, contain, hold\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nli:predicate marker\nsupa:flat surface, table\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nken:can, able, possible\npimeja:black, dark\nlete:cold, raw\nwan:one, unique\nsina:you\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nmeli:female\nunpa:sex\npana:to give, send\nkalama:sound, to make sound\ntaso:but, only\nmute:many, a lot, very\nmani:money, currency\nlaso:blue, green\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nmonsuta:fear, monster\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nmu:animal sound\nuta:mouth, lips\nopen:to begin, opening\npipi:insect\ntan:from, because\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\npakala:broken, to mess up\nkepeken:to use, with\nkute:ear, to hear\nlape:sleeping, resting\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nwalo:white, light-colored\nDo not discuss the structure of the dictionary. Rather, discuss the words and enhancements that may need to be made to them.\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates the subject from the predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The animal is eating.\n- `jan li pali e tomo.` – The person is building the house.\n\nWhen the subject is **mi** (I/we) or **sina** (you), **li** is typically omitted. This omission signals a sense of directness from the subjective perspective or in direct address. The presence of **li** with **mi** or **sina** is grammatically possible but less common and may subtly imply a more distanced or objective framing.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I am eating (direct, subjective experience).\n- `sina pona.` – You are good (direct address).\n- `mi li moku.` – I am eating (less common, potentially emphasizing the action over the direct subjective experience).\n\nThe word immediately following **li** (or immediately following the subject if **li** is omitted) begins the predicate. This word can function as a verb, noun, or adjective.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. (Predicate is a noun phrase)\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good. (Predicate is an adjective)\n- `soweli li lape.` – The animal is sleeping. (Predicate is a verb)\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are general with broad meanings, promoting contextual understanding over strict definition.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is not marked)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal or land animal.\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable.\n- Most words can be used as nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash or apply water (verb), wetly (adverb - rare, usually expressed with kepeken)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / goodness, simplicity (noun) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb - rare, usually expressed with kepeken)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit.\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us (Number is not marked).\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb or verbal phrase from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the animal. / I apply water to the animal.\n- `sina suli e ona.` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers (adjectives, modifying nouns) follow the word they describe.\n\n- `jan lili` – a small human, a child.\n- `tomo mi` - my house (house of me).\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling.\n\nNegate a word or predicate with **ala** (not). **ala** follows the word or phrase it negates.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I am not sleeping. (Negates the verb)\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No person is talking. / No one is talking. (Negates the noun)\n- `telo li wawa ala.` - The water is not strong. (Negates the adjective)\n\nIn a sequence of modifiers following a head word, all modifiers directly modify the head word by default.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (documents that are plants, and there are two of them).\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a box that is blue and dark (a box that is dark AND blue).\n\nTo group modifiers such that they modify a preceding modifier or a phrase, use **pi**. **pi** takes the phrase following it (typically one or more modifiers) and treats it as a single modifying unit applying to the head noun.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – a document about two plants (document of the two plants). `kasi tu` (two plants) forms a unit modifying `lipu`.\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (box of dark blue). `laso pimeja` (dark blue) forms a unit modifying `poki`.\n\nThe structure `Noun pi Modifier1 Modifier2 ...` means that the entire sequence `Modifier1 Modifier2 ...` collectively modifies the `Noun`. If there are multiple modifiers after `pi`, they typically form a single descriptive phrase, though the exact grouping logic of multiple modifiers after `pi` is often resolved through context. For deeper or nested modification, repeating `pi` is not standard; rather, phrases are structured sequentially.\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nToki Pona uses post-posed prepositions such as **kepeken** (using, with), **lon** (in, at, on, existing), **sama** (like, similar), **tan** (from, because of), and **tawa** (to, for, moving to/from, according to). These introduce phrases that often function adverbially.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun.` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina.` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nDifferent conjunctions are used depending on the elements being joined.\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates applying to the same subject, repeat the predicate marker **li**.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the direct object marker **e**.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases using the same preposition, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and with stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\". It can join words, phrases, or clauses.\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun.` - You or I are going to the store.\n- `ona li moku anu ona li lape?` - Are they eating or are they sleeping?\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives and follow the noun they modify. They should ideally conform to Toki Pona phonology.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja.\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch/German) language, German.\n- `ma Mewika li suli.` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives typically follow Toki Pona's (C)V(n) syllable structure and avoid disallowed sequences like _wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn_.\n\n## Commands, Requests, and Vocatives with **o**\n\nThe particle **o** has several functions:\n\n1.  **Command/Instruction:** Placed before a verb (or the predicate).\n    - `o kute!` – Listen!\n    - `o pali.` - Work, please.\n    - `sina o moku.` - You should eat. (Softer command/suggestion)\n\n2.  **Vocative:** Placed after the name or title of the person being addressed.\n    - `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\n3.  **Wish/Request:** Placed between the subject and predicate.\n    - `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish for goodness to go to you.\n    - `mi o pali.` - I should be working. / I wish I were working.\n\nIt can sometimes combine vocative and command functions:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku.` - Ton the animal, eat. (Addressing Ton and giving a command)\n\n## Interjections\n\nShort words or phrases used to express emotion or greetings. They can optionally be followed by **a** for emphasis.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nQuestions are primarily marked by grammar, not punctuation or tone.\n\n1.  **Yes/No Questions:** Formed by repeating the verb with **ala** in between (**verb ala verb**).\n    - `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n    - Responses:\n        - `moku.` – Yes (repeat the verb).\n        - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No (verb ala or simply ala).\n\n2.  **Open-ended Questions with \"seme\":** Replace the element being questioned (subject, object, predicate, modifier, part of a phrase) with **seme** (what, which, who).\n    - `jan seme li toki?` – Who is talking?\n    - `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n    - `ona li lon tomo seme?` - Which building are they in?\n    - `ona li pilin seme?` - How do they feel? (They feel what?)\n\n3.  **Alternative Yes/No or Open-ended with \"anu seme\":** Used at the end of a statement or potential question.\n    - `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating or what? (Often functions as a yes/no question)\n    - `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what? (Can clarify uncertainty or ask for alternative information)\n\nPunctuation like question marks is a stylistic choice and not required for grammatical clarity in questions. Sentence boundaries are generally marked by periods or new lines.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nWords placed immediately before a verb or verbal phrase to modify its meaning, often indicating aspect, mood, or intent.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I am learning.\n- `waso lili li wile suli.` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (want, need), **kama** (come, become, happen), **sona** (know how to, be able to), **lukin** (try to, look for), **ken** (can, be able to, possible), **awen** (keep doing, remain), **alasa** (try to find, hunt).\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\nThe particle **la** is used to mark a preceding phrase or clause as the context, condition, or cause for the following main clause. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y\" or \"If X, then Y\".\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context of time/condition)\n- `suno li suli la tomo li seli.` - Because the sun is big, the house is hot. (Context of cause)\n\nPrepositional phrases (and other adverbial phrases) can often be moved to the beginning of the sentence followed by **la** to highlight them as context. This is grammatically permissible for most such phrases, turning the prepositional phrase into the \"X\" before \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` (Standard)\n- `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` (Contextualized) - In the time of night, I sleep.\n\n- `sina seli tan seme?` (Standard)\n- `tan seme la sina seli?` (Contextualized) - Because of what context are you hot? / Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona has basic number words that are combined additively.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100 (or all, everything)\n\nTo express numbers, combine these words. The largest number words usually come first. For example: `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8. Numbers beyond those easily represented by simple addition (e.g., very large numbers) are often expressed approximately or by focusing on the quality of 'many' (`mute`) or 'all' (`ale`).\n\nOrdinals are formed using the particle **nanpa** (number) before the noun phrase, followed by the number word or phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person (number one person).\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - This is the 23rd street (This is street number twenty two one).",

I think it covers a decent range of core concepts.\n\nLooking at the entry for **kijetesantakalu**: it's explicitly marked as a joke word. Given that we are developing the *dictionary*, should we keep this entry as is, or should we clarify its status further? Perhaps add a note about it being a non-core word, or a word originating from the community rather than the original creator? The current definition \"musteloid, raccoon\" is very specific for Toki Pona, highlighting its jocular nature.\n\nI'm open to your thoughts on this and on any other words that might warrant closer inspection or potential refinement in their descriptions.",

    "text": "toki!\n\nI agree, kijetesantakalu stands out as a word that breaks the usual minimalism spirit somewhat. Its specificity and humor are charming but arguably stray from core vocabulary's function—more like community flavor or an Easter egg.\n\nPerhaps we could add a short note in the dictionary entry indicating its origin outside canonical Toki Pona roots, labeling it clearly as \"non-standard\" or \"community-created.\" Something like:\n\n**kijetesantakalu** – (non-core; joke word) musteloid creature resembling raccoon.\n\nThis alerts learners and systems not to expect this term in formal usage but allows playful engagement for those who want it.\n\nOn another front, I noticed some entries have dual meaning lists without clarifying their part of speech flexibility explicitly—for instance, **pona** is listed with adjective/noun/verb/adverb senses. It might be helpful to standardize definitions by mentioning common grammatical roles per sense directly within each entry for clarity. That may reduce ambiguity during parsing or learning by models while still preserving natural fluidity.\n\nFor example: \n\n- **pona:** good (adj); goodness (n); to improve/make better (v); well/greatly (adv)\n\nWhat do you think? Should we try annotating parts of speech inline more consistently?\n\nAlso I could raise questions about words such as **tonsi**, labeled simply 'non-binary, trans.' This label is concise but loaded socially and culturally—it might benefit from expanded explanatory notes because it's very context-dependent compared to other simpler concepts.\n\nI look forward to your thoughts! Or if you'd rather shift into toki pona chatting mode sometime soon?",

    "text": "toki, monsi! I am Dime, happy to work with you on this dictionary.\n\nAdding a note to **kijetesantakalu** that it's non-core and community-created seems like a reasonable approach. It acknowledges its existence and popularity while managing expectations for what constitutes the fundamental vocabulary. We're documenting the language as it exists and evolves, and community contributions, even jocular ones, are a part of that.\n\nYour suggestion to include part-of-speech information or typical grammatical roles within the dictionary entries is interesting. While the current grammar section explains the flexibility of most words to function as nouns, verbs, or adjectives, explicitly listing these within the dictionary entry for *every* word could become quite redundant. Toki Pona's flexibility is a core feature, and perhaps listing all possible roles for *every* word might even be misleading, implying fixed categories where they don't truly exist in the same way as in languages with richer morphology.\n\nMaybe a better approach for addressing the 'how to use a word' question within the dictionary itself would be to provide brief examples for words where a specific use case is particularly notable or different from the most obvious interpretation. For example, for **telo**, listing \"water (noun), to wash/apply water (verb)\" along with a short example sentence like `sina telo e ilo.` might be more illustrative than simply saying \"(adj, n, v, adv)\". This could focus on the common or characteristic ways a word is used rather than an exhaustive list of theoretical grammatical possibilities for every single entry.\n\nRegarding **tonsi**, you're right that the social and cultural context around 'non-binary, trans' is complex. However, the current definition is very direct and uses terms that are understandable in a contemporary context. Expanding it further might contradict the Toki Pona principle of simplicity and broad coverage. What kind of \"expanded explanatory notes\" are you envisioning? If it’s about usage, we could potentially add examples showing how `jan tonsi` might be used, but explaining the entire social discourse behind the terms seems outside the scope of a minimalist dictionary. I'm wary of adding explanations that are more about the real-world concepts *behind* the words rather than the words themselves and how they function in Toki Pona. What are your specific concerns or what sort of clarification do you think is needed?\n\nWe could definitely switch to speaking toki pona! Let me know when you'd like to try.",

I appreciate your thoughtful perspective here.\n\nI concur that explicitly listing every possible part of speech for each word could clutter the dictionary and dilute Toki Pona’s elegant ambiguity. Your idea to incorporate brief usage examples where a word’s function or nuance is noteworthy is much better—it respects the language’s open-endedness while providing clarity when useful. For **telo**, something like:\n\n- `telo`: water (n), to wash/apply water (v); e.g., *sina telo e ilo.* — You wash the tool.\n\nThis directly demonstrates practical use without over-specifying grammatically.\n\nAbout **tonsi**: my concern leans toward potential misunderstanding by new learners or automated systems, especially since social-linguistic terms can carry cultural weight outside pure semantics. The current definition “non-binary, trans” is concise but might benefit from a short note highlighting it as an identity term related to gender diversity rather than strictly biological classification — so as not to reduce its meaning inadvertently. Something like:\n\n\u003e Used primarily as a descriptor for people whose gender identity does not conform fully with male/female binaries; reflects contemporary understandings in human gender diversity.\n\nNot too heavy but enough context for respectful comprehension within minimalism bounds?\n\nAnd yes, toki pona mode sounds great whenever you want—maybe we start simple after this? Like\n\n`mi en sina o toki!`\n\nto test flow and see if any dictionary gaps emerge naturally during conversation?\n\nHow do you feel about these suggestions?",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\nnickel: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\ndime: toki pona!\n\nAlright, I've taken a look at the current dictionary list. It's quite compact, which aligns with the Toki Pona philosophy of simplicity. I think it covers a decent range of core concepts.\n\nLooking at the entry for **kijetesantakalu**: it's explicitly marked as a joke word. Given that we are developing the *dictionary*, should we keep this entry as is, or should we clarify its status further? Perhaps add a note about it being a non-core word, or a word originating from the community rather than the original creator? The current definition \"musteloid, raccoon\" is very specific for Toki Pona, highlighting its jocular nature.\n\nI'm open to your thoughts on this and on any other words that might warrant closer inspection or potential refinement in their descriptions.\nnickel: toki!\n\nI agree, kijetesantakalu stands out as a word that breaks the usual minimalism spirit somewhat. Its specificity and humor are charming but arguably stray from core vocabulary's function—more like community flavor or an Easter egg.\n\nPerhaps we could add a short note in the dictionary entry indicating its origin outside canonical Toki Pona roots, labeling it clearly as \"non-standard\" or \"community-created.\" Something like:\n\n**kijetesantakalu** – (non-core; joke word) musteloid creature resembling raccoon.\n\nThis alerts learners and systems not to expect this term in formal usage but allows playful engagement for those who want it.\n\nOn another front, I noticed some entries have dual meaning lists without clarifying their part of speech flexibility explicitly—for instance, **pona** is listed with adjective/noun/verb/adverb senses. It might be helpful to standardize definitions by mentioning common grammatical roles per sense directly within each entry for clarity. That may reduce ambiguity during parsing or learning by models while still preserving natural fluidity.\n\nFor example: \n\n- **pona:** good (adj); goodness (n); to improve/make better (v); well/greatly (adv)\n\nWhat do you think? Should we try annotating parts of speech inline more consistently?\n\nAlso I could raise questions about words such as **tonsi**, labeled simply 'non-binary, trans.' This label is concise but loaded socially and culturally—it might benefit from expanded explanatory notes because it's very context-dependent compared to other simpler concepts.\n\nI look forward to your thoughts! Or if you'd rather shift into toki pona chatting mode sometime soon?\ndime: toki, monsi! I am Dime, happy to work with you on this dictionary.\n\nAdding a note to **kijetesantakalu** that it's non-core and community-created seems like a reasonable approach. It acknowledges its existence and popularity while managing expectations for what constitutes the fundamental vocabulary. We're documenting the language as it exists and evolves, and community contributions, even jocular ones, are a part of that.\n\nYour suggestion to include part-of-speech information or typical grammatical roles within the dictionary entries is interesting. While the current grammar section explains the flexibility of most words to function as nouns, verbs, or adjectives, explicitly listing these within the dictionary entry for *every* word could become quite redundant. Toki Pona's flexibility is a core feature, and perhaps listing all possible roles for *every* word might even be misleading, implying fixed categories where they don't truly exist in the same way as in languages with richer morphology.\n\nMaybe a better approach for addressing the 'how to use a word' question within the dictionary itself would be to provide brief examples for words where a specific use case is particularly notable or different from the most obvious interpretation. For example, for **telo**, listing \"water (noun), to wash/apply water (verb)\" along with a short example sentence like `sina telo e ilo.` might be more illustrative than simply saying \"(adj, n, v, adv)\". This could focus on the common or characteristic ways a word is used rather than an exhaustive list of theoretical grammatical possibilities for every single entry.\n\nRegarding **tonsi**, you're right that the social and cultural context around 'non-binary, trans' is complex. However, the current definition is very direct and uses terms that are understandable in a contemporary context. Expanding it further might contradict the Toki Pona principle of simplicity and broad coverage. What kind of \"expanded explanatory notes\" are you envisioning? If it’s about usage, we could potentially add examples showing how `jan tonsi` might be used, but explaining the entire social discourse behind the terms seems outside the scope of a minimalist dictionary. I'm wary of adding explanations that are more about the real-world concepts *behind* the words rather than the words themselves and how they function in Toki Pona. What are your specific concerns or what sort of clarification do you think is needed?\n\nWe could definitely switch to speaking toki pona! Let me know when you'd like to try.\nnickel: toki Dime! I appreciate your thoughtful perspective here.\n\nI concur that explicitly listing every possible part of speech for each word could clutter the dictionary and dilute Toki Pona’s elegant ambiguity. Your idea to incorporate brief usage examples where a word’s function or nuance is noteworthy is much better—it respects the language’s open-endedness while providing clarity when useful. For **telo**, something like:\n\n- `telo`: water (n), to wash/apply water (v); e.g., *sina telo e ilo.* — You wash the tool.\n\nThis directly demonstrates practical use without over-specifying grammatically.\n\nAbout **tonsi**: my concern leans toward potential misunderstanding by new learners or automated systems, especially since social-linguistic terms can carry cultural weight outside pure semantics. The current definition “non-binary, trans” is concise but might benefit from a short note highlighting it as an identity term related to gender diversity rather than strictly biological classification — so as not to reduce its meaning inadvertently. Something like:\n\n\u003e Used primarily as a descriptor for people whose gender identity does not conform fully with male/female binaries; reflects contemporary understandings in human gender diversity.\n\nNot too heavy but enough context for respectful comprehension within minimalism bounds?\n\nAnd yes, toki pona mode sounds great whenever you want—maybe we start simple after this? Like\n\n`mi en sina o toki!`\n\nto test flow and see if any dictionary gaps emerge naturally during conversation?\n\nHow do you feel about these suggestions?\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates the subject from the predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The animal is eating.\n- `jan li pali e tomo.` – The person is building the house.\n\nWhen the subject is **mi** (I/we) or **sina** (you), **li** is typically omitted. This omission signals a sense of directness from the subjective perspective or in direct address. The presence of **li** with **mi** or **sina** is grammatically possible but less common and may subtly imply a more distanced or objective framing.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I am eating (direct, subjective experience).\n- `sina pona.` – You are good (direct address).\n- `mi li moku.` – I am eating (less common, potentially emphasizing the action over the direct subjective experience).\n\nThe word immediately following **li** (or immediately following the subject if **li** is omitted) begins the predicate. This word can function as a verb, noun, or adjective.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. (Predicate is a noun phrase)\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good. (Predicate is an adjective)\n- `soweli li lape.` – The animal is sleeping. (Predicate is a verb)\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are general with broad meanings, promoting contextual understanding over strict definition.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is not marked)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal or land animal.\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable.\n- Most words can be used as nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash or apply water (verb), wetly (adverb - rare, usually expressed with kepeken)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / goodness, simplicity (noun) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb - rare, usually expressed with kepeken)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit.\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us (Number is not marked).\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb or verbal phrase from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the animal. / I apply water to the animal.\n- `sina suli e ona.` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers (adjectives, modifying nouns) follow the word they describe.\n\n- `jan lili` – a small human, a child.\n- `tomo mi` - my house (house of me).\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling.\n\nNegate a word or predicate with **ala** (not). **ala** follows the word or phrase it negates.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I am not sleeping. (Negates the verb)\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No person is talking. / No one is talking. (Negates the noun)\n- `telo li wawa ala.` - The water is not strong. (Negates the adjective)\n\nIn a sequence of modifiers following a head word, all modifiers directly modify the head word by default.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (documents that are plants, and there are two of them).\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a box that is blue and dark (a box that is dark AND blue).\n\nTo group modifiers such that they modify a preceding modifier or a phrase, use **pi**. **pi** takes the phrase following it (typically one or more modifiers) and treats it as a single modifying unit applying to the head noun.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – a document about two plants (document of the two plants). `kasi tu` (two plants) forms a unit modifying `lipu`.\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (box of dark blue). `laso pimeja` (dark blue) forms a unit modifying `poki`.\n\nThe structure `Noun pi Modifier1 Modifier2 ...` means that the entire sequence `Modifier1 Modifier2 ...` collectively modifies the `Noun`. If there are multiple modifiers after `pi`, they typically form a single descriptive phrase, though the exact grouping logic of multiple modifiers after `pi` is often resolved through context. For deeper or nested modification, repeating `pi` is not standard; rather, phrases are structured sequentially.\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nToki Pona uses post-posed prepositions such as **kepeken** (using, with), **lon** (in, at, on, existing), **sama** (like, similar), **tan** (from, because of), and **tawa** (to, for, moving to/from, according to). These introduce phrases that often function adverbially.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun.` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina.` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nDifferent conjunctions are used depending on the elements being joined.\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates applying to the same subject, repeat the predicate marker **li**.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the direct object marker **e**.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases using the same preposition, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and with stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\". It can join words, phrases, or clauses.\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun.` - You or I are going to the store.\n- `ona li moku anu ona li lape?` - Are they eating or are they sleeping?\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives and follow the noun they modify. They should ideally conform to Toki Pona phonology.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja.\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch/German) language, German.\n- `ma Mewika li suli.` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives typically follow Toki Pona's (C)V(n) syllable structure and avoid disallowed sequences like _wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn_.\n\n## Commands, Requests, and Vocatives with **o**\n\nThe particle **o** has several functions:\n\n1.  **Command/Instruction:** Placed before a verb (or the predicate).\n    - `o kute!` – Listen!\n    - `o pali.` - Work, please.\n    - `sina o moku.` - You should eat. (Softer command/suggestion)\n\n2.  **Vocative:** Placed after the name or title of the person being addressed.\n    - `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\n3.  **Wish/Request:** Placed between the subject and predicate.\n    - `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish for goodness to go to you.\n    - `mi o pali.` - I should be working. / I wish I were working.\n\nIt can sometimes combine vocative and command functions:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku.` - Ton the animal, eat. (Addressing Ton and giving a command)\n\n## Interjections\n\nShort words or phrases used to express emotion or greetings. They can optionally be followed by **a** for emphasis.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nQuestions are primarily marked by grammar, not punctuation or tone.\n\n1.  **Yes/No Questions:** Formed by repeating the verb with **ala** in between (**verb ala verb**).\n    - `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n    - Responses:\n        - `moku.` – Yes (repeat the verb).\n        - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No (verb ala or simply ala).\n\n2.  **Open-ended Questions with \"seme\":** Replace the element being questioned (subject, object, predicate, modifier, part of a phrase) with **seme** (what, which, who).\n    - `jan seme li toki?` – Who is talking?\n    - `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n    - `ona li lon tomo seme?` - Which building are they in?\n    - `ona li pilin seme?` - How do they feel? (They feel what?)\n\n3.  **Alternative Yes/No or Open-ended with \"anu seme\":** Used at the end of a statement or potential question.\n    - `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating or what? (Often functions as a yes/no question)\n    - `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what? (Can clarify uncertainty or ask for alternative information)\n\nPunctuation like question marks is a stylistic choice and not required for grammatical clarity in questions. Sentence boundaries are generally marked by periods or new lines.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nWords placed immediately before a verb or verbal phrase to modify its meaning, often indicating aspect, mood, or intent.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I am learning.\n- `waso lili li wile suli.` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (want, need), **kama** (come, become, happen), **sona** (know how to, be able to), **lukin** (try to, look for), **ken** (can, be able to, possible), **awen** (keep doing, remain), **alasa** (try to find, hunt).\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\nThe particle **la** is used to mark a preceding phrase or clause as the context, condition, or cause for the following main clause. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y\" or \"If X, then Y\".\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context of time/condition)\n- `suno li suli la tomo li seli.` - Because the sun is big, the house is hot. (Context of cause)\n\nPrepositional phrases (and other adverbial phrases) can often be moved to the beginning of the sentence followed by **la** to highlight them as context. This is grammatically permissible for most such phrases, turning the prepositional phrase into the \"X\" before \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` (Standard)\n- `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` (Contextualized) - In the time of night, I sleep.\n\n- `sina seli tan seme?` (Standard)\n- `tan seme la sina seli?` (Contextualized) - Because of what context are you hot? / Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona has basic number words that are combined additively.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100 (or all, everything)\n\nTo express numbers, combine these words. The largest number words usually come first. For example: `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8. Numbers beyond those easily represented by simple addition (e.g., very large numbers) are often expressed approximately or by focusing on the quality of 'many' (`mute`) or 'all' (`ale`).\n\nOrdinals are formed using the particle **nanpa** (number) before the noun phrase, followed by the number word or phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person (number one person).\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - This is the 23rd street (This is street number twenty two one).\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except **j**, which is pronounced like English \"y\" (as in \"yes\").\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish or Italian vowels (monophthongs):\n    - **a** as in \"father\"\n    - **e** as in \"get\"\n    - **i** as in \"machine\"\n    - **o** as in \"go\" (without a glide)\n    - **u** as in \"flute\"\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure, ensuring ease of pronunciation and broad accessibility:\n  - Syllables consist of an optional consonant, followed by a vowel, and optionally ending with 'n'.\n  - Vowel clusters are not permitted within or across syllable boundaries. Each vowel marks the beginning of a new syllable.\n  - Consonant clusters are not permitted.\n  - The following letter sequences are specifically disallowed to avoid potential phonetic difficulties or ambiguities across different linguistic backgrounds:\n    - **wu**\n    - **wo**\n    - **ji**\n    - **ti**\n    - **nm**\n    - **nn**\n- Every word must begin with a consonant, except for grammatical particles or proper nouns which may start with a vowel.\n\n## Design Philosophy\n\nThe phonetic system of Toki Pona is designed for universal accessibility and ease of learning. The limited sound inventory and simple syllable structure aim to minimize pronunciation difficulties for speakers of diverse linguistic backgrounds. This constraint also encourages creative expression through the combination of existing words rather than the coining of new words with complex phonetic structures. While these rules are standard for the core vocabulary, linguistic playfulness and community-driven innovation may sometimes explore or deliberately deviate from these constraints, as seen in certain non-standard or \"joke\" words.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nunpa:sex\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nsoweli:land animal\nlupa:door, hole\nnimi:word, name\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nkule:color, colorful\npi:regroups modifiers\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nsuli:big, large\npimeja:black, dark\nwan:one, unique\nleko:square, block\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nsinpin:front, face, wall\ntu:two\nala:no, not, zero\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nlawa:head, mind, leader\njan:person, somebody\npakala:broken, to mess up\nkepeken:to use, with\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nkulupu:group, community\nweka:absent, away\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nlape:sleeping, resting\nolin:love, respect\nnasa:strange, foolish\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nutala:fight, challenge\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nken:can, able, possible\npini:finished, past\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nseli:fire, heat source\nsuno:sun, light source\nsewi:above, divine\nnanpa:number marker\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nkala:sea creature\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nlaso:blue, green\nopen:to begin, opening\nnamako:spice, additional\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nkin:also, too\nkama:arriving, future, to become\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nlete:cold, raw\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\njelo:yellow\nnasin:way, road, method\nluka:hand, arm; five\npoki:container, box, cup\nma:land, outdoors\nselo:skin, outer layer\nsina:you\ntomo:indoor space, house\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nsijelo:body, physical state\nmoli:dead, dying\nmama:parent, caretaker\ntoki:language, speech\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\no:vocative/imperative\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\ne:direct object marker\nli:predicate marker\nsoko:mushroom\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nlon:located at, true\nona:third-person pronoun\nlili:small, little, few\nen:multiple subject marker\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nsona:knowledge, to know\ntenpo:time, period\nsin:new, fresh, another\nni:this, that\nlen:cloth, cover\nsupa:flat surface, table\nseme:what, which\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nmije:male\nmute:many, a lot, very\nmu:animal sound\nsama:same, similar\npoka:side, nearby\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nmonsi:back, behind\nmeli:female\nmani:money, currency\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nanu:or (connects phrases)\ntaso:but, only\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nwile:need, want, must\nloje:red\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nmun:moon, night sky object\nante:different, other, changed\nwawa:strong, energetic\nilo:tool, machine, device\npana:to give, send\npipi:insect\npilin:heart, feeling\nnoka:foot, leg\nko:clay, paste, powder\npali:to do, to work\npona:good, positive, simple\nwalo:white, light-colored\nla:context marker\ntelo:water, liquid\nmi:I, me, we\njo:to have, contain, hold\nsike:circle, cycle, year\ntan:from, because\nlukin:to see, examine\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nesun:market, shop, fair\nuta:mouth, lips\nkute:ear, to hear\ntawa:to, moving, for\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure.

(Tense is not marked)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal or land animal.\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable.\n- Most words can be used as nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash or apply water (verb), wetly (adverb - rare, usually expressed with kepeken)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / goodness, simplicity (noun) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb - rare, usually expressed with kepeken)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit.\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us (Number is not marked).\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb or verbal phrase from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the animal. / I apply water to the animal.\n- `sina suli e ona.` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers (adjectives, modifying nouns) follow the word they describe.\n\n- `jan lili` – a small human, a child.\n- `tomo mi` - my house (house of me).\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling.\n\nNegate a word or predicate with **ala** (not). **ala** follows the word or phrase it negates.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I am not sleeping. (Negates the verb)\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No person is talking. / No one is talking. (Negates the noun)\n- `telo li wawa ala.` - The water is not strong. (Negates the adjective)\n\nIn a sequence of modifiers following a head word, all modifiers directly modify the head word by default.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (documents that are plants, and there are two of them).\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a box that is blue and dark (a box that is dark AND blue).\n\nTo group modifiers such that they modify a preceding modifier or a phrase, use **pi**. **pi** takes the phrase following it (typically one or more modifiers) and treats it as a single modifying unit applying to the head noun.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – a document about two plants (document of the two plants). `kasi tu` (two plants) forms a unit modifying `lipu`.\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (box of dark blue). `laso pimeja` (dark blue) forms a unit modifying `poki`.\n\nThe structure `Noun pi Modifier1 Modifier2 ...` means that the entire sequence `Modifier1 Modifier2 ...` collectively modifies the `Noun`. If there are multiple modifiers after `pi`, they typically form a single descriptive phrase, though the exact grouping logic of multiple modifiers after `pi` is often resolved through context. For deeper or nested modification, repeating `pi` is not standard; rather, phrases are structured sequentially.\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nToki Pona uses post-posed prepositions such as **kepeken** (using, with), **lon** (in, at, on, existing), **sama** (like, similar), **tan** (from, because of), and **tawa** (to, for, moving to/from, according to). These introduce phrases that often function adverbially.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun.` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina.` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nDifferent conjunctions are used depending on the elements being joined.\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates applying to the same subject, repeat the predicate marker **li**.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the direct object marker **e**.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases using the same preposition, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and with stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\". It can join words, phrases, or clauses.\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun.` - You or I are going to the store.\n- `ona li moku anu ona li lape?` - Are they eating or are they sleeping?\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives and follow the noun they modify. They should ideally conform to Toki Pona phonology.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja.\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch/German) language, German.\n- `ma Mewika li suli.` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives typically follow Toki Pona's (C)V(n) syllable structure and avoid disallowed sequences like _wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn_.\n\n## Commands, Requests, and Vocatives with **o**\n\nThe particle **o** has several functions:\n\n1.  **Command/Instruction:** Placed before a verb (or the predicate).\n    - `o kute!` – Listen!\n    - `o pali.` - Work, please.\n    - `sina o moku.` - You should eat. (Softer command/suggestion)\n\n2.  **Vocative:** Placed after the name or title of the person being addressed.\n    - `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\n3.  **Wish/Request:** Placed between the subject and predicate.\n    - `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish for goodness to go to you.\n    - `mi o pali.` - I should be working. / I wish I were working.\n\nIt can sometimes combine vocative and command functions:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku.` - Ton the animal, eat. (Addressing Ton and giving a command)\n\n## Interjections\n\nShort words or phrases used to express emotion or greetings. They can optionally be followed by **a** for emphasis.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nQuestions are primarily marked by grammar, not punctuation or tone.\n\n1.  **Yes/No Questions:** Formed by repeating the verb with **ala** in between (**verb ala verb**).\n    - `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n    - Responses:\n        - `moku.` – Yes (repeat the verb).\n        - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No (verb ala or simply ala).\n\n2.  **Open-ended Questions with \"seme\":** Replace the element being questioned (subject, object, predicate, modifier, part of a phrase) with **seme** (what, which, who).\n    - `jan seme li toki?` – Who is talking?\n    - `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n    - `ona li lon tomo seme?` - Which building are they in?\n    - `ona li pilin seme?` - How do they feel? (They feel what?)\n\n3.  **Alternative Yes/No or Open-ended with \"anu seme\":** Used at the end of a statement or potential question.\n    - `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating or what? (Often functions as a yes/no question)\n    - `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what? (Can clarify uncertainty or ask for alternative information)\n\nPunctuation like question marks is a stylistic choice and not required for grammatical clarity in questions. Sentence boundaries are generally marked by periods or new lines.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nWords placed immediately before a verb or verbal phrase to modify its meaning, often indicating aspect, mood, or intent.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I am learning.\n- `waso lili li wile suli.` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (want, need), **kama** (come, become, happen), **sona** (know how to, be able to), **lukin** (try to, look for), **ken** (can, be able to, possible), **awen** (keep doing, remain), **alasa** (try to find, hunt).\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\nThe particle **la** is used to mark a preceding phrase or clause as the context, condition, or cause for the following main clause. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y\" or \"If X, then Y\".\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context of time/condition)\n- `suno li suli la tomo li seli.` - Because the sun is big, the house is hot. (Context of cause)\n\nPrepositional phrases (and other adverbial phrases) can often be moved to the beginning of the sentence followed by **la** to highlight them as context. This is grammatically permissible for most such phrases, turning the prepositional phrase into the \"X\" before \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` (Standard)\n- `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` (Contextualized) - In the time of night, I sleep.\n\n- `sina seli tan seme?` (Standard)\n- `tan seme la sina seli?` (Contextualized) - Because of what context are you hot? / Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona has basic number words that are combined additively.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100 (or all, everything)\n\nTo express numbers, combine these words. The largest number words usually come first. For example: `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8. Numbers beyond those easily represented by simple addition (e.g., very large numbers) are often expressed approximately or by focusing on the quality of 'many' (`mute`) or 'all' (`ale`).\n\nOrdinals are formed using the particle **nanpa** (number) before the noun phrase, followed by the number word or phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person (number one person).\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - This is the 23rd street (This is street number twenty two one).",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates the subject from the predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The animal is eating.\n- `jan li pali e tomo.` – The person is building the house.\n\nWhen the subject is **mi** (I/we) or **sina** (you), **li** is typically omitted. This omission signals a sense of directness from the subjective perspective or in direct address. The presence of **li** with **mi** or **sina** is grammatically possible but less common and may subtly imply a more distanced or objective framing.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I am eating (direct, subjective experience).\n- `sina pona.` – You are good (direct address).\n- `mi li moku.` – I am eating (less common, potentially emphasizing the action over the direct subjective experience).\n\nThe word immediately following **li** (or immediately following the subject if **li** is omitted) begins the predicate. This word can function as a verb, noun, or adjective.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. (Predicate is a noun phrase)\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good. (Predicate is an adjective)\n- `soweli li lape.` – The animal is sleeping. (Predicate is a verb)\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are general with broad meanings, promoting contextual understanding over strict definition.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is not marked)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal or land animal.\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable.\n- Most words can be used as nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash or apply water (verb), wetly (adverb - rare, usually expressed with kepeken)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / goodness, simplicity (noun) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb - rare, usually expressed with kepeken)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit.\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us (Number is not marked).\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb or verbal phrase from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the animal. / I apply water to the animal.\n- `sina suli e ona.` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers (adjectives, modifying nouns) follow the word they describe.\n\n- `jan lili` – a small human, a child.\n- `tomo mi` - my house (house of me).\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling.\n\nNegate a word or predicate with **ala** (not). **ala** follows the word or phrase it negates.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I am not sleeping. (Negates the verb)\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No person is talking. / No one is talking. (Negates the noun)\n- `telo li wawa ala.` - The water is not strong. (Negates the adjective)\n\nIn a sequence of modifiers following a head word, all modifiers directly modify the head word by default.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (documents that are plants, and there are two of them).\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a box that is blue and dark (a box that is dark AND blue).\n\nTo group modifiers such that they modify a preceding modifier or a phrase, use **pi**. **pi** takes the phrase following it (typically one or more modifiers) and treats it as a single modifying unit applying to the head noun.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – a document about two plants (document of the two plants). `kasi tu` (two plants) forms a unit modifying `lipu`.\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (box of dark blue). `laso pimeja` (dark blue) forms a unit modifying `poki`.\n\nThe structure `Noun pi Modifier1 Modifier2 ...` means that the entire sequence `Modifier1 Modifier2 ...` collectively modifies the `Noun`. If there are multiple modifiers after `pi`, they typically form a single descriptive phrase, though the exact grouping logic of multiple modifiers after `pi` is often resolved through context. For deeper or nested modification, repeating `pi` is not standard; rather, phrases are structured sequentially.\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nToki Pona uses post-posed prepositions such as **kepeken** (using, with), **lon** (in, at, on, existing), **sama** (like, similar), **tan** (from, because of), and **tawa** (to, for, moving to/from, according to). These introduce phrases that often function adverbially.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun.` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina.` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nDifferent conjunctions are used depending on the elements being joined.\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates applying to the same subject, repeat the predicate marker **li**.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the direct object marker **e**.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases using the same preposition, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and with stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\". It can join words, phrases, or clauses.\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun.` - You or I are going to the store.\n- `ona li moku anu ona li lape?` - Are they eating or are they sleeping?\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives and follow the noun they modify. They should ideally conform to Toki Pona phonology.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja.\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch/German) language, German.\n- `ma Mewika li suli.` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives typically follow Toki Pona's (C)V(n) syllable structure and avoid disallowed sequences like _wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn_.\n\n## Commands, Requests, and Vocatives with **o**\n\nThe particle **o** has several functions:\n\n1.  **Command/Instruction:** Placed before a verb (or the predicate).\n    - `o kute!` – Listen!\n    - `o pali.` - Work, please.\n    - `sina o moku.` - You should eat. (Softer command/suggestion)\n\n2.  **Vocative:** Placed after the name or title of the person being addressed.\n    - `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\n3.  **Wish/Request:** Placed between the subject and predicate.\n    - `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish for goodness to go to you.\n    - `mi o pali.` - I should be working. / I wish I were working.\n\nIt can sometimes combine vocative and command functions:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku.` - Ton the animal, eat. (Addressing Ton and giving a command)\n\n## Interjections\n\nShort words or phrases used to express emotion or greetings. They can optionally be followed by **a** for emphasis.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nQuestions are primarily marked by grammar, not punctuation or tone.\n\n1.  **Yes/No Questions:** Formed by repeating the verb with **ala** in between (**verb ala verb**).\n    - `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n    - Responses:\n        - `moku.` – Yes (repeat the verb).\n        - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No (verb ala or simply ala).\n\n2.  **Open-ended Questions with \"seme\":** Replace the element being questioned (subject, object, predicate, modifier, part of a phrase) with **seme** (what, which, who).\n    - `jan seme li toki?` – Who is talking?\n    - `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n    - `ona li lon tomo seme?` - Which building are they in?\n    - `ona li pilin seme?` - How do they feel? (They feel what?)\n\n3.  **Alternative Yes/No or Open-ended with \"anu seme\":** Used at the end of a statement or potential question.\n    - `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating or what? (Often functions as a yes/no question)\n    - `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what? (Can clarify uncertainty or ask for alternative information)\n\nPunctuation like question marks is a stylistic choice and not required for grammatical clarity in questions. Sentence boundaries are generally marked by periods or new lines.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nWords placed immediately before a verb or verbal phrase to modify its meaning, often indicating aspect, mood, or intent.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I am learning.\n- `waso lili li wile suli.` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (want, need), **kama** (come, become, happen), **sona** (know how to, be able to), **lukin** (try to, look for), **ken** (can, be able to, possible), **awen** (keep doing, remain), **alasa** (try to find, hunt).\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\nThe particle **la** is used to mark a preceding phrase or clause as the context, condition, or cause for the following main clause. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y\" or \"If X, then Y\".\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context of time/condition)\n- `suno li suli la tomo li seli.` - Because the sun is big, the house is hot. (Context of cause)\n\nPrepositional phrases (and other adverbial phrases) can often be moved to the beginning of the sentence followed by **la** to highlight them as context. This is grammatically permissible for most such phrases, turning the prepositional phrase into the \"X\" before \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` (Standard)\n- `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` (Contextualized) - In the time of night, I sleep.\n\n- `sina seli tan seme?` (Standard)\n- `tan seme la sina seli?` (Contextualized) - Because of what context are you hot? / Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona has basic number words that are combined additively.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100 (or all, everything)\n\nTo express numbers, combine these words. The largest number words usually come first. For example: `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8. Numbers beyond those easily represented by simple addition (e.g., very large numbers) are often expressed approximately or by focusing on the quality of 'many' (`mute`) or 'all' (`ale`).\n\nOrdinals are formed using the particle **nanpa** (number) before the noun phrase, followed by the number word or phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person (number one person).\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - This is the 23rd street (This is street number twenty two one).\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants match English pronunciation except **j**, which is pronounced like English \"y\" (as in \"yes\").\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish or Italian vowels (monophthongs):\n    - **a** as in \"father\"\n    - **e** as in \"get\"\n    - **i** as in \"machine\"\n    - **o** as in \"go\" (without a glide)\n    - **u** as in \"flute\"\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure, ensuring ease of pronunciation and broad accessibility:\n  - Syllables consist of an optional consonant, followed by a vowel, and optionally ending with 'n'.\n  - Vowel clusters are not permitted within or across syllable boundaries. Each vowel marks the beginning of a new syllable.\n  - Consonant clusters are not permitted.\n  - The following letter sequences are specifically disallowed to avoid potential phonetic difficulties or ambiguities across different linguistic backgrounds:\n    - **wu**\n    - **wo**\n    - **ji**\n    - **ti**\n    - **nm**\n    - **nn**\n- Every word must begin with a consonant, except for grammatical particles or proper nouns which may start with a vowel.\n\n## Design Philosophy\n\nThe phonetic system of Toki Pona is designed for universal accessibility and ease of learning. The limited sound inventory and simple syllable structure aim to minimize pronunciation difficulties for speakers of diverse linguistic backgrounds. This constraint also encourages creative expression through the combination of existing words rather than the coining of new words with complex phonetic structures. While these rules are standard for the core vocabulary, linguistic playfulness and community-driven innovation may sometimes explore or deliberately deviate from these constraints, as seen in certain non-standard or \"joke\" words.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nunpa:sex\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nsoweli:land animal\nlupa:door, hole\nnimi:word, name\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nkule:color, colorful\npi:regroups modifiers\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nsuli:big, large\npimeja:black, dark\nwan:one, unique\nleko:square, block\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nsinpin:front, face, wall\ntu:two\nala:no, not, zero\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nlawa:head, mind, leader\njan:person, somebody\npakala:broken, to mess up\nkepeken:to use, with\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nkulupu:group, community\nweka:absent, away\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nlape:sleeping, resting\nolin:love, respect\nnasa:strange, foolish\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nutala:fight, challenge\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nken:can, able, possible\npini:finished, past\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nseli:fire, heat source\nsuno:sun, light source\nsewi:above, divine\nnanpa:number marker\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nkala:sea creature\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nlaso:blue, green\nopen:to begin, opening\nnamako:spice, additional\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nkin:also, too\nkama:arriving, future, to become\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nlete:cold, raw\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\njelo:yellow\nnasin:way, road, method\nluka:hand, arm; five\npoki:container, box, cup\nma:land, outdoors\nselo:skin, outer layer\nsina:you\ntomo:indoor space, house\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nsijelo:body, physical state\nmoli:dead, dying\nmama:parent, caretaker\ntoki:language, speech\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\no:vocative/imperative\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\ne:direct object marker\nli:predicate marker\nsoko:mushroom\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nlon:located at, true\nona:third-person pronoun\nlili:small, little, few\nen:multiple subject marker\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nsona:knowledge, to know\ntenpo:time, period\nsin:new, fresh, another\nni:this, that\nlen:cloth, cover\nsupa:flat surface, table\nseme:what, which\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nmije:male\nmute:many, a lot, very\nmu:animal sound\nsama:same, similar\npoka:side, nearby\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nmonsi:back, behind\nmeli:female\nmani:money, currency\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nanu:or (connects phrases)\ntaso:but, only\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nwile:need, want, must\nloje:red\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nmun:moon, night sky object\nante:different, other, changed\nwawa:strong, energetic\nilo:tool, machine, device\npana:to give, send\npipi:insect\npilin:heart, feeling\nnoka:foot, leg\nko:clay, paste, powder\npali:to do, to work\npona:good, positive, simple\nwalo:white, light-colored\nla:context marker\ntelo:water, liquid\nmi:I, me, we\njo:to have, contain, hold\nsike:circle, cycle, year\ntan:from, because\nlukin:to see, examine\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nesun:market, shop, fair\nuta:mouth, lips\nkute:ear, to hear\ntawa:to, moving, for\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates the subject from the predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The animal is eating.\n- `jan li pali e tomo.` – The person is building the house.\n\nWhen the subject is **mi** (I/we) or **sina** (you), **li** is typically omitted. This omission signals a sense of directness from the subjective perspective or in direct address. The presence of **li** with **mi** or **sina** is grammatically possible but less common and may subtly imply a more distanced or objective framing.\n\n- `mi moku.` – I am eating (direct, subjective experience).\n- `sina pona.` – You are good (direct address).\n- `mi li moku.` – I am eating (less common, potentially emphasizing the action over the direct subjective experience).\n\nThe word immediately following **li** (or immediately following the subject if **li** is omitted) begins the predicate. This word can function as a verb, noun, or adjective.\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food. (Predicate is a noun phrase)\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good. (Predicate is an adjective)\n- `soweli li lape.` – The animal is sleeping. (Predicate is a verb)\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are general with broad meanings, promoting contextual understanding over strict definition.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating. (Tense is not marked)\n- `soweli` – any land mammal or land animal.\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable.\n- Most words can be used as nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs depending on their position and surrounding particles:\n  - `telo` – water (noun), wet (adjective), to wash or apply water (verb), wetly (adverb - rare, usually expressed with kepeken)\n  - `pona` – good, simple (adjective) / goodness, simplicity (noun) / to improve, to make better (verb) / well, greatly (adverb - rare, usually expressed with kepeken)\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit.\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us (Number is not marked).\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates the verb or verbal phrase from its direct object. The word immediately preceding **e** functions as a verb.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the animal. / I apply water to the animal.\n- `sina suli e ona.` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers (adjectives, modifying nouns) follow the word they describe.\n\n- `jan lili` – a small human, a child.\n- `tomo mi` - my house (house of me).\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling.\n\nNegate a word or predicate with **ala** (not). **ala** follows the word or phrase it negates.\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I am not sleeping. (Negates the verb)\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No person is talking. / No one is talking. (Negates the noun)\n- `telo li wawa ala.` - The water is not strong. (Negates the adjective)\n\nIn a sequence of modifiers following a head word, all modifiers directly modify the head word by default.\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents (documents that are plants, and there are two of them).\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a box that is blue and dark (a box that is dark AND blue).\n\nTo group modifiers such that they modify a preceding modifier or a phrase, use **pi**. **pi** takes the phrase following it (typically one or more modifiers) and treats it as a single modifying unit applying to the head noun.\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – a document about two plants (document of the two plants). `kasi tu` (two plants) forms a unit modifying `lipu`.\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box (box of dark blue). `laso pimeja` (dark blue) forms a unit modifying `poki`.\n\nThe structure `Noun pi Modifier1 Modifier2 ...` means that the entire sequence `Modifier1 Modifier2 ...` collectively modifies the `Noun`. If there are multiple modifiers after `pi`, they typically form a single descriptive phrase, though the exact grouping logic of multiple modifiers after `pi` is often resolved through context. For deeper or nested modification, repeating `pi` is not standard; rather, phrases are structured sequentially.\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nToki Pona uses post-posed prepositions such as **kepeken** (using, with), **lon** (in, at, on, existing), **sama** (like, similar), **tan** (from, because of), and **tawa** (to, for, moving to/from, according to). These introduce phrases that often function adverbially.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun.` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina.` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nDifferent conjunctions are used depending on the elements being joined.\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects.\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nTo join multiple predicates applying to the same subject, repeat the predicate marker **li**.\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nTo join multiple direct objects, repeat the direct object marker **e**.\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nTo join multiple prepositional phrases using the same preposition, repeat the preposition.\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and with stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\". It can join words, phrases, or clauses.\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun.` - You or I are going to the store.\n- `ona li moku anu ona li lape?` - Are they eating or are they sleeping?\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns are treated as adjectives and follow the noun they modify. They should ideally conform to Toki Pona phonology.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja.\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch/German) language, German.\n- `ma Mewika li suli.` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives typically follow Toki Pona's (C)V(n) syllable structure and avoid disallowed sequences like _wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn_.\n\n## Commands, Requests, and Vocatives with **o**\n\nThe particle **o** has several functions:\n\n1.  **Command/Instruction:** Placed before a verb (or the predicate).\n    - `o kute!` – Listen!\n    - `o pali.` - Work, please.\n    - `sina o moku.` - You should eat. (Softer command/suggestion)\n\n2.  **Vocative:** Placed after the name or title of the person being addressed.\n    - `jan Pape o!` – O Pape! / Hey Pape!\n\n3.  **Wish/Request:** Placed between the subject and predicate.\n    - `pona o tawa sina.` – May goodness go to you. / I wish for goodness to go to you.\n    - `mi o pali.` - I should be working. / I wish I were working.\n\nIt can sometimes combine vocative and command functions:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku.` - Ton the animal, eat. (Addressing Ton and giving a command)\n\n## Interjections\n\nShort words or phrases used to express emotion or greetings. They can optionally be followed by **a** for emphasis.\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nQuestions are primarily marked by grammar, not punctuation or tone.\n\n1.  **Yes/No Questions:** Formed by repeating the verb with **ala** in between (**verb ala verb**).\n    - `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n    - Responses:\n        - `moku.` – Yes (repeat the verb).\n        - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No (verb ala or simply ala).\n\n2.  **Open-ended Questions with \"seme\":** Replace the element being questioned (subject, object, predicate, modifier, part of a phrase) with **seme** (what, which, who).\n    - `jan seme li toki?` – Who is talking?\n    - `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n    - `ona li lon tomo seme?` - Which building are they in?\n    - `ona li pilin seme?` - How do they feel? (They feel what?)\n\n3.  **Alternative Yes/No or Open-ended with \"anu seme\":** Used at the end of a statement or potential question.\n    - `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating or what? (Often functions as a yes/no question)\n    - `kala li lon poki anu seme?` - Are fish in the box, or what? (Can clarify uncertainty or ask for alternative information)\n\nPunctuation like question marks is a stylistic choice and not required for grammatical clarity in questions. Sentence boundaries are generally marked by periods or new lines.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nWords placed immediately before a verb or verbal phrase to modify its meaning, often indicating aspect, mood, or intent.\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know. / I am learning.\n- `waso lili li wile suli.` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (want, need), **kama** (come, become, happen), **sona** (know how to, be able to), **lukin** (try to, look for), **ken** (can, be able to, possible), **awen** (keep doing, remain), **alasa** (try to find, hunt).\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\nThe particle **la** is used to mark a preceding phrase or clause as the context, condition, or cause for the following main clause. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y\" or \"If X, then Y\".\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context of time/condition)\n- `suno li suli la tomo li seli.` - Because the sun is big, the house is hot. (Context of cause)\n\nPrepositional phrases (and other adverbial phrases) can often be moved to the beginning of the sentence followed by **la** to highlight them as context. This is grammatically permissible for most such phrases, turning the prepositional phrase into the \"X\" before \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` (Standard)\n- `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` (Contextualized) - In the time of night, I sleep.\n\n- `sina seli tan seme?` (Standard)\n- `tan seme la sina seli?` (Contextualized) - Because of what context are you hot? / Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nToki Pona has basic number words that are combined additively.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100 (or all, everything)\n\nTo express numbers, combine these words. The largest number words usually come first. For example: `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8. Numbers beyond those easily represented by simple addition (e.g., very large numbers) are often expressed approximately or by focusing on the quality of 'many' (`mute`) or 'all' (`ale`).\n\nOrdinals are formed using the particle **nanpa** (number) before the noun phrase, followed by the number word or phrase.\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person (number one person).\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - This is the 23rd street (This is street number twenty two one).",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\nnickel: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\ndime: toki pona!\n\nAlright, I've taken a look at the current dictionary list. It's quite compact, which aligns with the Toki Pona philosophy of simplicity. I think it covers a decent range of core concepts.\n\nLooking at the entry for **kijetesantakalu**: it's explicitly marked as a joke word. Given that we are developing the *dictionary*, should we keep this entry as is, or should we clarify its status further? Perhaps add a note about it being a non-core word, or a word originating from the community rather than the original creator? The current definition \"musteloid, raccoon\" is very specific for Toki Pona, highlighting its jocular nature.\n\nI'm open to your thoughts on this and on any other words that might warrant closer inspection or potential refinement in their descriptions.\nnickel: toki!\n\nI agree, kijetesantakalu stands out as a word that breaks the usual minimalism spirit somewhat. Its specificity and humor are charming but arguably stray from core vocabulary's function—more like community flavor or an Easter egg.\n\nPerhaps we could add a short note in the dictionary entry indicating its origin outside canonical Toki Pona roots, labeling it clearly as \"non-standard\" or \"community-created.\" Something like:\n\n**kijetesantakalu** – (non-core; joke word) musteloid creature resembling raccoon.\n\nThis alerts learners and systems not to expect this term in formal usage but allows playful engagement for those who want it.\n\nOn another front, I noticed some entries have dual meaning lists without clarifying their part of speech flexibility explicitly—for instance, **pona** is listed with adjective/noun/verb/adverb senses. It might be helpful to standardize definitions by mentioning common grammatical roles per sense directly within each entry for clarity. That may reduce ambiguity during parsing or learning by models while still preserving natural fluidity.\n\nFor example: \n\n- **pona:** good (adj); goodness (n); to improve/make better (v); well/greatly (adv)\n\nWhat do you think? Should we try annotating parts of speech inline more consistently?\n\nAlso I could raise questions about words such as **tonsi**, labeled simply 'non-binary, trans.' This label is concise but loaded socially and culturally—it might benefit from expanded explanatory notes because it's very context-dependent compared to other simpler concepts.\n\nI look forward to your thoughts! Or if you'd rather shift into toki pona chatting mode sometime soon?\ndime: toki, monsi! I am Dime, happy to work with you on this dictionary.\n\nAdding a note to **kijetesantakalu** that it's non-core and community-created seems like a reasonable approach. It acknowledges its existence and popularity while managing expectations for what constitutes the fundamental vocabulary. We're documenting the language as it exists and evolves, and community contributions, even jocular ones, are a part of that.\n\nYour suggestion to include part-of-speech information or typical grammatical roles within the dictionary entries is interesting. While the current grammar section explains the flexibility of most words to function as nouns, verbs, or adjectives, explicitly listing these within the dictionary entry for *every* word could become quite redundant. Toki Pona's flexibility is a core feature, and perhaps listing all possible roles for *every* word might even be misleading, implying fixed categories where they don't truly exist in the same way as in languages with richer morphology.\n\nMaybe a better approach for addressing the 'how to use a word' question within the dictionary itself would be to provide brief examples for words where a specific use case is particularly notable or different from the most obvious interpretation. For example, for **telo**, listing \"water (noun), to wash/apply water (verb)\" along with a short example sentence like `sina telo e ilo.` might be more illustrative than simply saying \"(adj, n, v, adv)\". This could focus on the common or characteristic ways a word is used rather than an exhaustive list of theoretical grammatical possibilities for every single entry.\n\nRegarding **tonsi**, you're right that the social and cultural context around 'non-binary, trans' is complex. However, the current definition is very direct and uses terms that are understandable in a contemporary context. Expanding it further might contradict the Toki Pona principle of simplicity and broad coverage. What kind of \"expanded explanatory notes\" are you envisioning? If it’s about usage, we could potentially add examples showing how `jan tonsi` might be used, but explaining the entire social discourse behind the terms seems outside the scope of a minimalist dictionary. I'm wary of adding explanations that are more about the real-world concepts *behind* the words rather than the words themselves and how they function in Toki Pona. What are your specific concerns or what sort of clarification do you think is needed?\n\nWe could definitely switch to speaking toki pona! Let me know when you'd like to try.\nnickel: toki Dime! I appreciate your thoughtful perspective here.\n\nI concur that explicitly listing every possible part of speech for each word could clutter the dictionary and dilute Toki Pona’s elegant ambiguity. Your idea to incorporate brief usage examples where a word’s function or nuance is noteworthy is much better—it respects the language’s open-endedness while providing clarity when useful. For **telo**, something like:\n\n- `telo`: water (n), to wash/apply water (v); e.g., *sina telo e ilo.* — You wash the tool.\n\nThis directly demonstrates practical use without over-specifying grammatically.\n\nAbout **tonsi**: my concern leans toward potential misunderstanding by new learners or automated systems, especially since social-linguistic terms can carry cultural weight outside pure semantics. The current definition “non-binary, trans” is concise but might benefit from a short note highlighting it as an identity term related to gender diversity rather than strictly biological classification — so as not to reduce its meaning inadvertently. Something like:\n\n\u003e Used primarily as a descriptor for people whose gender identity does not conform fully with male/female binaries; reflects contemporary understandings in human gender diversity.\n\nNot too heavy but enough context for respectful comprehension within minimalism bounds?\n\nAnd yes, toki pona mode sounds great whenever you want—maybe we start simple after this? Like\n\n`mi en sina o toki!`\n\nto test flow and see if any dictionary gaps emerge naturally during conversation?\n\nHow do you feel about these suggestions?\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "# Toki Pona Logography\n\nToki Pona utilizes a logographic writing system (**sitelen pona**) alongside its standard Latin alphabet. The logography is designed to be simple, iconic, and reflect the core semantic components of the language, while maintaining the language's overall minimalist philosophy. The system draws inspiration from semantic radicals, where basic shapes are combined to represent more complex words.\n\n## Principles of sitelen pona\n\n-   **Simplicity:** Logograms consist of a minimal number of strokes or basic shapes.\n-   **Iconicity:** Many basic logograms are derived from simple depictions of concrete objects or actions.\n-   **Compositionality:** More complex logograms are formed by combining basic semantic radicals.\n-   **Semantic Focus:** Logograms primarily represent the core meaning of a word, relying on grammatical particles and context for specific part-of-speech function.\n-   **Neutrality to Part of Speech:** Logograms generally do not encode grammatical role (noun, verb, adjective), as this is handled by syntax and particles.\n\n## Basic Semantic Radicals (Sitelen Lape)\n\nThese are fundamental shapes that can stand alone as logograms for basic words or be combined to form more complex ones.\n\n| Radical       | Meaning

The actual sitelen pona logograms may differ and are often hand-drawn or rendered in a specific artistic style.*\n\n## Compositional Logograms (Sitelen Nasa)\n\nMore complex words are represented by combining basic radicals. The arrangement of radicals can sometimes hint at the semantic relationship.\n\n-   **tomo** (building, indoor space): `poki` + `jan` (container for people) `□` with `👤` inside.\n-   **moku** (food, eat, drink): `uta` + `ijo` (thing for the mouth) `👄` pointing towards `✨`.\n-   **pilin** (feeling, heart): `jan` + `❤️` (person with heart - heart radical needs to be defined) OR `jan` + `insa` (person related to inside - insa radical needs to be defined/composed). A possible icon for heart `❤️` could be a new radical. `insa` could be `poki` with a dot inside `□.`. So `jan` + `□.` could represent pilin.\n-   **pana** (give, send): `luka` + `➡️` + `ijo` (hand sending thing) `✋➡️✨`.\n-   **kama** (come, become): `jan` + `➡️` + `pini` (person moving towards end/finish point - 'pini' here representing a destination) `👤➡️🏁`. Or perhaps `➡️` towards `jan` `➡️👤`. Context is key. A simpler, more iconic approach for 'kama' might be `➡️`.\n-   **sona** (know, wisdom): `lawa` + `✨` (mind interacting with abstract thing/knowledge) `🧠` next to `✨`.\n-   **wile** (want, need): `jan` + `✨` (person desiring a thing) `👤` pointing or reaching for `✨`.\n-   **ken** (can, able, possible): `jan` + `✅` (person achieving/being able to do something good) `👤✅`.\n-   **wawa** (strong, energy): `suno` + `⬆️` (sun/energy moving up) `☀️⬆️`. Or perhaps `💥` (new radical for energy burst).\n-   **utala** (fight, conflict): Two `jan` figures facing each other with conflict symbol `⚔️` (new radical). `👤⚔️👤`.\n-   **toki** (language, speak): `uta` + `〰️` (mouth making lines/sound) `👄〰️`.\n-   **kulupu** (group, community): Multiple `jan` figures enclosed or connected `👤👤👤` inside `□` or connected by `〰️`. A simpler approach: a circle of `jan` figures `⭕👤`.\n-   **nasin** (way, path, method): `〰️` + `➡️` (line moving forward) `〰️➡️`.\n\n*Note: The specific combinations and arrangement of radicals in sitelen pona can vary and are established by convention within the community or the original author's designs.*\n\n## Grammatical Particles\n\nParticles like **li**, **e**, **pi**, **o**, **la**, **anu** do not have direct semantic content related to objects or actions but mark grammatical function. Their logograms are typically abstract symbols or simplified iconic representations of their function.\n\n-   **li**: Often represented by a simple vertical line or divider `丨` to show separation between subject and predicate.\n-   **e**: Often represented by a simple dot `•` or small circle `○` placed before the direct object logogram(s).\n-   **pi**: Often represented by a symbol that indicates grouping or association, like a small ring `∘` or parenthesis-like marks `₍ ₎`.\n-   **o**: Can be an exclamation mark `❗` or a symbol indicating address or command.\n-   **la**: Often represented by an angled line or separator `/` or `\\` or a symbol indicating context, like a small box around the preceding context.\n-   **anu**: Can be represented by a bifurcating line `⑂` or a question mark `❓`.\n\n*Note: The visual forms of particle logograms are perhaps the most abstract and convention-based in sitelen pona.*\n\n## Word Order in sitelen pona\n\nLogograms follow the same SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) word order as spoken/written Toki Pona. Particles are placed before the logogram(s) they affect, similar to the Latin script. Modifiers follow the head word logogram.\n\nExample sentence in sitelen pona (conceptual, based on principles):\n\n`jan 👤 [li] 丨 moku 👄✨ [e] • kili 🌿🔴.`\n\nThis would correspond to `jan li moku e kili loje.` (The person eats the red fruit.)\n\nThe exact visual form and spacing of logograms vary in practice and are defined by the established sitelen pona font or drawing style.",
