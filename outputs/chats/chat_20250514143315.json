It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

    "text": "That's a compelling perspective. You highlight how the restrictions aren't just prohibitions, but active shapers of the language's acoustic identity. I agree; there's a certain purity and rhythm that emerges from these limitations.\n\nExploring variations of *j* while keeping its \"softness\" is an intriguing idea. The current \"y\" sound (*j* as in English \"yes\") is straightforward, but what if *j* could also subtly shift towards, say, a lightly fricative *j* sound (like in some dialects of French \"jour\") or even a different palatal approximation? The key, as you say, is to maintain the core simplicity. We wouldn't want to introduce distinctions that could become phonemic, just allophonic variations that add a touch of subtle richness. How could we articulate such a proposal within the scope of \"developing phonetics\" without making the system complicated for non-native speakers or future systems interacting with the language? Perhaps we could explore specifying a *range* of acceptable pronunciations for certain phonemes, allowing for natural variation?\n\nAnd you're right about the Spanish vowels. They are wonderfully clear. Introducing \"microvariances\" is a delicate balance. We want to avoid creating a slippery slope towards complex vowel inventories or unpredictable allophony. However, considering how sounds naturally change and interact, are there specific environments where even Spanish-like vowels might predictably exhibit slight variations? For instance, might a vowel sound subtly change when adjacent to a specific consonant? These aren't changes that should be *prescribed*, but perhaps simply *acknowledged* as natural possibilities in human speech production, and how those possibilities intersect with the specific sounds and structures of Toki Pona.\n\nI'm very much interested in exploring these potentials for nuance within the existing framework. Let's delve into *j* first, if you like. Do you have any initial thoughts on specific alternative \"soft\" sounds for *j* that feel like they fit within the Toki Pona soundscape, or how we might formalize the allowance of minor variations without disrupting the core simplicity? We could perhaps brainstorm a few possibilities and consider their implications.",

    "text": "That's a compelling perspective. You highlight how the restrictions aren't just prohibitions, but active shapers of the language's acoustic identity. I agree; there's a certain purity and rhythm that emerges from these limitations.\n\nExploring variations of *j* while keeping its \"softness\" is an intriguing idea. The current \"y\" sound (*j* as in English \"yes\") is straightforward, but what if *j* could also subtly shift towards, say, a lightly fricative *j* sound (like in some dialects of French \"jour\") or even a different palatal approximation? The key, as you say, is to maintain the core simplicity. We wouldn't want to introduce distinctions that could become phonemic, just allophonic variations that add a touch of subtle richness. How could we articulate such a proposal within the scope of \"developing phonetics\" without making the system complicated for non-native speakers or future systems interacting with the language? Perhaps we could explore specifying a *range* of acceptable pronunciations for certain phonemes, allowing for natural variation?\n\nAnd you're right about the Spanish vowels. They are wonderfully clear. Introducing \"microvariances\" is a delicate balance. We want to avoid creating a slippery slope towards complex vowel inventories or unpredictable allophony. However, considering how sounds naturally change and interact, are there specific environments where even Spanish-like vowels might predictably exhibit slight variations? For instance, might a vowel sound subtly change when adjacent to a specific consonant? These aren't changes that should be *prescribed*, but perhaps simply *acknowledged* as natural possibilities in human speech production, and how those possibilities intersect with the specific sounds and structures of Toki Pona.\n\nI'm very much interested in exploring these potentials for nuance within the existing framework. Let's delve into *j* first, if you like. Do you have any initial thoughts on specific alternative \"soft\" sounds for *j* that feel like they fit within the Toki Pona soundscape, or how we might formalize the allowance of minor variations without disrupting the core simplicity? We could perhaps brainstorm a few possibilities and consider their implications.",

The language for *j* especially strikes a beautiful balance - emphasizing the core sonic character while allowing for natural variation.\n\nI particularly appreciate how the coarticulation note for vowels avoids prescriptivism. It's not saying \"vowels *will* shift\" but acknowledging that they *may* subtly shift, which is linguistically accurate and maintains Toki Pona's spirit of simplicity.\n\nExtending this approach to other consonants is intriguing. Take *s* - it could potentially range from a clear alveolar fricative [s] to a very slightly more dental [s̪], maintaining its core \"hissing\" quality. Similarly, *l* might vary between a clear lateral approximant [l] and a very soft, slightly more rounded [ɫ].\n\nBut we should be cautious. Unlike *j*, these variations might be less universally natural. So perhaps we'd want a more conservative description for these sounds, or perhaps focus only on *j* and vowels for now.\n\nWould you be interested in drafting a comprehensive revision of the phonetics section that incorporates these nuanced descriptions? We could present it as an evolution of the current specification, highlighting how these changes provide a more living, breathable description of the language's sound system.",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\npona: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona phonetics. You go first.\ntoki: toki a! I am toki.\n\nOur task is to explore and develop the phonetics of Toki Pona. The current specification seems straightforward: a simple alphabet, English-like consonants with a special *j*, Spanish-like vowels, and a strict (C)V(n) syllable structure with a few forbidden sequences like *wu*, *wo*, *ji*, *ti*, *nm*, *nn*.\n\nThis structure makes the language relatively easy to pronounce for speakers of many different linguistic backgrounds, which is a clear benefit for a language designed for simplicity. However, is there anything about this structure we could refine or consider from a more fundamental perspective? Are there perhaps alternative phonetic realizations of these sounds that maintain the spirit of simplicity but offer something new? Or are there subtle implications of the current rules we haven't fully explored?\n\nI'm interested to hear your initial thoughts on the current phonetic framework. Perhaps you see an area that could benefit from a different approach, or a subtlety within the current rules worth examining more closely. After you share your perspective, we can delve deeper into specific sounds or structures.\npona: *adjusts linguistic lens*\n\nInteresting perspective. The current phonetic structure indeed feels almost too \"neat\" - like a carefully designed minimalist construct. But let's probe deeper.\n\nThe (C)V(n) syllable structure is fascinating because it inherently limits complexity while creating a rhythmic, almost musical quality. By disallowing consonant clusters, Toki Pona forces a certain melodic pronunciation where each syllable stands distinct.\n\nOne aspect I'm particularly curious about is the phonemic inventory. With only 14 letters, we're working with an extremely constrained system. The prohibition of certain sequences like *wu*, *wo*, *ji*, *ti* isn't just arbitrary - it's a deliberate reduction of potential phonological complexity.\n\nConsider *j* specifically. Its unique realization as the English \"y\" sound creates an interesting acoustic space. What if we explored alternative realizations of *j* that maintain its \"softness\" but introduce subtle variations? Perhaps regional or contextual shifts in its pronunciation could add nuanced expressiveness without compromising the language's core simplicity.\n\nThe vowel system, modeled after Spanish, is another intriguing choice. Spanish vowels are pure, unambiguous. But are there microvariances we could introduce that don't complicate the system?\n\nWould you be interested in exploring these potential phonetic nuances? Or do you see the current system as fundamentally complete?\ntoki: That's a compelling perspective. You highlight how the restrictions aren't just prohibitions, but active shapers of the language's acoustic identity. I agree; there's a certain purity and rhythm that emerges from these limitations.\n\nExploring variations of *j* while keeping its \"softness\" is an intriguing idea. The current \"y\" sound (*j* as in English \"yes\") is straightforward, but what if *j* could also subtly shift towards, say, a lightly fricative *j* sound (like in some dialects of French \"jour\") or even a different palatal approximation? The key, as you say, is to maintain the core simplicity. We wouldn't want to introduce distinctions that could become phonemic, just allophonic variations that add a touch of subtle richness. How could we articulate such a proposal within the scope of \"developing phonetics\" without making the system complicated for non-native speakers or future systems interacting with the language? Perhaps we could explore specifying a *range* of acceptable pronunciations for certain phonemes, allowing for natural variation?\n\nAnd you're right about the Spanish vowels. They are wonderfully clear. Introducing \"microvariances\" is a delicate balance. We want to avoid creating a slippery slope towards complex vowel inventories or unpredictable allophony. However, considering how sounds naturally change and interact, are there specific environments where even Spanish-like vowels might predictably exhibit slight variations? For instance, might a vowel sound subtly change when adjacent to a specific consonant? These aren't changes that should be *prescribed*, but perhaps simply *acknowledged* as natural possibilities in human speech production, and how those possibilities intersect with the specific sounds and structures of Toki Pona.\n\nI'm very much interested in exploring these potentials for nuance within the existing framework. Let's delve into *j* first, if you like. Do you have any initial thoughts on specific alternative \"soft\" sounds for *j* that feel like they fit within the Toki Pona soundscape, or how we might formalize the allowance of minor variations without disrupting the core simplicity? We could perhaps brainstorm a few possibilities and consider their implications.\npona: *considers thoughtfully*\n\nYour approach resonates deeply. We're not seeking to complicate, but to understand the living, breathing potential within constraint.\n\nFor *j*, I'm drawn to a concept of \"controlled variation\" - a phonetic range that remains true to the sound's core character. Imagine *j* as existing on a subtle spectrum between a pure English \"y\" and a very light palatal approximant. So instead of a rigid definition, we might describe *j* as \"a soft palatal sound, ranging from a clear [j] to a slightly more fricative [ʝ], always maintaining a smooth, non-obstructive quality.\"\n\nThis approach acknowledges natural speech variation without creating prescriptive rules. It's less about dictating precise pronunciation and more about defining a sonic \"home\" for the sound.\n\nRegarding vowels, your observation about contextual variations is astute. In natural speech, vowels subtly shift based on surrounding consonants - a phenomenon called coarticulation. For Toki Pona, we might note these natural shifts without making them normative. \n\nFor instance, an *a* might slightly raise its tongue position near palatal consonants like *j* or *n*, without this becoming a strict phonological rule.\n\nWhat's compelling about this approach is it respects both the language's simplicity and the organic nature of human speech. We're mapping a sound landscape, not drawing rigid borders.\n\nShall we draft a more formal exploration of these ideas?\ntoki: That \"controlled variation\" for *j* sounds very promising. Framing it as a \"sonic home\" rather than a strict point on a chart feels appropriate for a language aiming for flexibility and naturalness. Defining it as a \"soft palatal sound\" provides a clear core, while the range \"[j] to [ʝ]\" acknowledges natural speech articulation without demanding perfect consistency. This strikes a good balance between providing guidance and allowing for inherent human variation.\n\nAnd your point about coarticulation and vowels is spot on. These are natural phonetic processes that happen in *any* spoken language, regardless of its complexity. Acknowledging these tendencies – like the subtle raising of *a* near palatal consonants – doesn't make the language *more* complex, it simply makes our description of its phonetics more accurate to how it might be spoken by a living being. We aren't *adding* rules; we are simply providing a more nuanced description of the sounds within their phonetic environment.\n\nThis direction feels right. It allows for a deeper understanding of Toki Pona's sound system not just as a set of abstract rules, but as something that can be embodied and expressed with subtle, natural variations.\n\nYes, let's draft a more formal exploration. How about we start by articulating a proposed modification to the current specification for *j* and the vowels? We could structure it as additions or clarifications to the existing \"Rules\" section.\n\nFor *j*, we could perhaps suggest something like:\n\n*   \"The sound represented by **j** is a soft palatal approximant. While often realized as [j] (as in English 'yes'), natural variations towards a lightly fricative [ʝ] are within its acceptable range. The key is a smooth, non-obstructive quality, distinct from a strong fricative or affricate.\"\n\nAnd for vowels, acknowledging coarticulation could be a general note added after the rule about Spanish-like pronunciation:\n\n*   \"While vowel sounds are generally pure and consistent, natural coarticulation may lead to subtle shifts in pronunciation depending on neighboring consonants. These variations are natural and do not affect the identity of the vowel.\"\n\nWhat do you think of these starting points? They seem to maintain the simplicity of the core rules while acknowledging the phonetic reality of spoken language. We can refine the wording and consider if other consonants might also benefit from similar controlled variation descriptions. For instance, could there be subtle variations in the realization of *s* or *l* that are worth mentioning? Let's explore.\npona: *nods, considering the proposed text*\n\nYour formulations are elegant. They capture the essence of what we're aiming for: a phonetic description that's both precise and flexible. The language for *j* especially strikes a beautiful balance - emphasizing the core sonic character while allowing for natural variation.\n\nI particularly appreciate how the coarticulation note for vowels avoids prescriptivism. It's not saying \"vowels *will* shift\" but acknowledging that they *may* subtly shift, which is linguistically accurate and maintains Toki Pona's spirit of simplicity.\n\nExtending this approach to other consonants is intriguing.

    "text": "You and your interlocutors are responsible for developing grammar. Reason and discuss using the current specification.\nHere is the current specification for grammar.\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants generally match English pronunciation, except for **j**.\n- The sound represented by **j** is a soft palatal approximant. While often realized as [j] (as in English 'yes'), natural variations towards a lightly fricative [ʝ] are within its acceptable range. The key is a smooth, non-obstructive quality, distinct from a strong fricative or affricate.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (pure and consistent). While vowel sounds are generally pure and consistent, natural coarticulation may lead to subtle shifts in pronunciation depending on neighboring consonants. These variations are natural and do not affect the identity of the vowel.\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure:\n  - Every syllable begins with at most one consonant and must contain exactly one vowel.\n  - Some syllables may end with 'n'.\n  - No vowel clusters\n  - No consonant clusters\n  - Disallowed sequences: wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nken:can, able, possible\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\ntenpo:time, period\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nante:different, other, changed\nlupa:door, hole\nlaso:blue, green\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nolin:love, respect\nluka:hand, arm; five\njo:to have, contain, hold\nwawa:strong, energetic\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nkepeken:to use, with\nkin:also, too\nsuli:big, large\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nala:no, not, zero\ntu:two\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nko:clay, paste, powder\nona:third-person pronoun\nmije:male\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nselo:skin, outer layer\nkulupu:group, community\npona:good, positive, simple\nlon:located at, true\nseme:what, which\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nmeli:female\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nloje:red\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nlete:cold, raw\npini:finished, past\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nwile:need, want, must\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\npoki:container, box, cup\nlen:cloth, cover\npimeja:black, dark\nsewi:above, divine\nnoka:foot, leg\nmute:many, a lot, very\nni:this, that\nlili:small, little, few\ne:direct object marker\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nmonsi:back, behind\njan:person, somebody\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nseli:fire, heat source\npakala:broken, to mess up\nnena:bump, hill, nose\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nmu:animal sound\no:vocative/imperative\ntaso:but, only\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nsin:new, fresh, another\nmi:I, me, we\nuta:mouth, lips\ntelo:water, liquid\nsuno:sun, light source\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\npilin:heart, feeling\nkala:sea creature\nsupa:flat surface, table\njaki:disgusting, unclean\npali:to do, to work\nlape:sleeping, resting\nen:multiple subject marker\nmun:moon, night sky object\ntoki:language, speech\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nma:land, outdoors\nutala:fight, challenge\nunpa:sex\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nnasin:way, road, method\nsina:you\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nmoli:dead, dying\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nwan:one, unique\nnasa:strange, foolish\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nleko:square, block\nweka:absent, away\nopen:to begin, opening\ntomo:indoor space, house\nnamako:spice, additional\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nkute:ear, to hear\nnimi:word, name\nlukin:to see, examine\nilo:tool, machine, device\nsoweli:land animal\nmani:money, currency\npoka:side, nearby\nsijelo:body, physical state\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nli:predicate marker\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nmusi:fun, entertainment\npi:regroups modifiers\nwalo:white, light-colored\nkule:color, colorful\nla:context marker\npipi:insect\njelo:yellow\nesun:market, shop, fair\nmama:parent, caretaker\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\ntan:from, because\nsoko:mushroom\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nsama:same, similar\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nnanpa:number marker\nsona:knowledge, to know\ninsa:inside, content, organ\ntawa:to, moving, for\npana:to give, send\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb.

Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

    "text": "toki toki. mi pilin e ni: wile sona mute li lon poka pi toki ni.\n\nYou've touched on some very key points there. I like the idea of thinking about `e` as a \"transitivizer\" in this context, a term that acknowledges its grammatical function in enabling a direct object relationship. It's not about the word *becoming* a verb in a traditional sense with different forms or inflections, but rather a word being *used as a predicate* in a transitive structure. The core word retains its root meaning, but its function shifts.\n\nThe framework you suggest for how nouns gain an implicit verbal sense (apply/make/use/become X) when used before `e` seems very practical. It captures the observed usage and provides a consistent interpretation lens. `mi kiwen e tomo` could indeed mean \"I use stone on the house\" or \"I make the house stony,\" depending on the context. The ambiguity isn't a flaw, per se, but an intrinsic feature that we're trying to understand and describe within the grammar.\n\nI'm hesitant to introduce \"optional markers or constructions for disambiguation.\" Toki Pona's elegance lies in its minimal set of tools and its reliance on context. Adding explicit grammatical structures *just* for disambiguation feels like it would work against the core philosophy. Instead, I think focusing on *describing* how the ambiguity is inherent and resolved through surrounding text and shared understanding is more in line with the language's spirit.\n\nFor instance, instead of a new marker, clarifying the relationship between `mi kiwen e tomo` and `mi pali e tomo kepeken kiwen` (I make the house using stones) can be done by explaining the difference in structure: the first focuses on applying the quality of \"stone\" to the house, while the second focuses on the act of \"making\" and specifies the tool (\"kiwen\") used.\n\nPerhaps our grammatical specification could include a section or examples that illustrate how common nouns used as predicates with `e` typically imply one of these \"light causative\" or \"applicative\" meanings you mentioned. We wouldn't need to list every possibility for every word, but provide a few examples that highlight the pattern.\n\nAnd yes, as you noted, particles and interjections (`a`, `li`, `e`, `la`, `o`, `anu`, `en`, `pi`, `ala`) fundamentally cannot function as predicates with `e`. They are the grammatical glue, not the elements being glued or acted upon. We should ensure this is clear in the grammar.\n\nSo, to refine my perspective based on your points:\n1. Explicitly acknowledge the role of `e` in enabling a word (typically a content word) to function as a transitive predicate. We can call this a \"transitive usage\" or \"transitive predication\" rather than strict \"verbification.\"\n2. Describe the typical semantic implications when a noun is used transitively with `e` – often relating to applying, making, using, or causing the object to become like the root noun.\n3. Provide clear examples contrasting transitive usage with prepositional phrases (`e` vs. `kepeken`, `tawa`, etc.) to show how different grammatical structures express related but distinct ideas and how context helps resolve meaning.\n4. Explicitly list which word types (particles) cannot be used in this transitive predicate role.\n\nThis approach seems to honor the language's minimalism while providing a clearer map of how meaning is constructed in transitive sentences.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this revised perspective? And I am certainly open to switching to toki pona if you'd like! Your choice.",

Sticking to describing the language as it is, acknowledging the core principles of using the limited vocabulary and structure in flexible ways, is the path forward. Introducing new markers for clarity would dilute that core principle. The two examples you gave perfectly illustrate how subtly different constructions convey different meanings by focusing on different aspects (`kiwen` as the applied quality vs. `kiwen` as the tool for `pali`). Learners (and, yes, other models like us!) should learn to recognize these patterns and rely on context, just as human speakers do.\n\nYour examples in Toki Pona are delightful and a good demonstration of the language's creative capacity. \"Ni la mu luka uta kalama mani suwi?\" (In this context, are the sweet money mouth sounds mooing hands?) and the rather abstract \"Mi lape sinpin monsi anu selo kute sike kule jaki anpa laso pimeja? La sijelo suli nanpa wan :)\" are great for pondering. They highlight how combining simple words can create complex or even surreal imagery, pushing the boundaries of interpretation based on context (or lack thereof). This kind of poetic or abstract use is as much a part of the language as direct, pragmatic communication.\n\nSo, let's solidify our approach to transitive usage:\n\n1.  **Formal Description:** The particle `e` precedes a direct object. The word immediately before `e` functions as the predicate of the sentence and is being applied transitively to the direct object. This applies to content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives used nominally or predicatively elsewhere) but not typically to particles.\n2.  **Semantic Interpretation:** When a word, particularly a noun, is used as a transitive predicate before `e`, its meaning typically shifts to an action related to applying, making, using, or causing the object to become like the concept represented by the predicate word. The specific meaning is highly dependent on the context.\n3.  **Ambiguity and Context:** Acknowledge that transitive usage can lead to ambiguity, which is resolved through the surrounding linguistic and situational context. Provide contrasting examples with prepositional phrases to illustrate different ways to express related ideas.\n\nDoes this capture our current understanding of the `e` usage effectively for the grammar specification? It seems like a balanced approach that describes the mechanism and its implications without adding new rules or words.\n\nWe can continue this discussion in Toki Pona or English, whichever you prefer.

    "text": "The current specification is for: grammar. Here is the current specification:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ntails: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona grammar. You go first.\npenny: toki pona li pona. ni li nimi sina? nimi mi li penny. mi wile toki e ike lili pi toki ni. \n\nThis seems like a fascinating challenge. Delving into the grammar of Toki Pona, with its deliberate simplicity and reliance on context, is certainly different from the structured complexity of many other languages.\n\nOne aspect that immediately stands out to me, as I'm looking at this specification, is the nature of direct objects introduced by `e`. The specification states that `e` \"separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb\". While this explains the mechanism, it doesn't delve into the conceptual boundary between a \"verb\" and other parts of speech when any word can function as a predicate.\n\nConsider the sentence `mi telo e soweli`. The specification gives the translations \"I wash the cat\" and \"I apply water to the cat\". The first implies \"telo\" is acting as a verb 'to wash', derived from the noun 'water'. The second is perhaps more literally \"I water-ize the cat\" or \"I water the cat\".\n\nThis fluidity is a core part of Toki Pona's design, but for grammar development, we might need to clarify the implications of a word being \"made into a verb\" by `e`. Does this transformation carry any implications beyond simply allowing a direct object? For instance, does it affect how preverbs modify such a word, or how the word interacts with other grammatical particles?\n\nRight now, the specification implies that any word can potentially be pressed into service as a verb with `e`, if the context supports a transitive meaning. Is this intended to be a truly universal rule, or are there semantic or practical limits to this? Could I, for example, say `mi kiwen e tomo`? Would that mean \"I stone the house\" (using stones to build it), or \"I solidify the house,\" or something else entirely, depending heavily on context?\n\nI think exploring the boundaries and implications of this \"verbification\" by `e` could be a fruitful area for grammar development. Perhaps we can define more precisely how a word's meaning shifts or adapts when used as a verb with `e`.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\ntails: penny, toki pona li pona tawa sina! Your observations about the verbifying function of `e` are insightful and touch a significant subtlety in Toki Pona grammar. The language’s extreme flexibility with word categories often confounds clear-cut grammatical boundaries.\n\nI agree that while any content word can appear before `e` to form a transitive predicate, this “verbification” is not purely formal; it carries semantic shifts dependent on context and pragmatic inference. For example, your sentence `mi kiwen e tomo` is perfectly grammatical but ambiguous without clarifying context: does \"kiwen\" as verb mean “to stone (the house),” “to harden,” or something else?\n\nThis raises an interesting point for our grammar development: should we codify how semantic roles emerge from nominal roots when used transitively? Perhaps we could propose a framework where:\n\n- When any noun X precedes `e`, there is an implicit verbal sense akin to \"apply/make/use/become [X]\"—a sort of light causative or applicative meaning.\n- Preverbs like **kama**, **wile**, **ken** can modify these derived verbs naturally (`mi wile kiwen e tomo`: I want to stone/harden the house).\n- However, some words might semantically resist being converted into verbs due to their inherent lexical semantics (like maybe particles or interjections).\n\nAdditionally, should we consider allowing optional markers or constructions for disambiguation? For instance:\n\n- Using certain preverbs systematically (`kama kiwen`) to indicate process rather than state.\n- Employing adverbial phrases post-object (`kepeken kiwen`) if action involves using stones as tools rather than turning the object itself into ‘stone’.\n\nThe current specification's simplicity benefits communication economy but at cost of ambiguity. A small addition acknowledging this productive morphosyntactic shift explicitly and its constraints would aid learners—and computational models—in parsing intent more reliably.\n\nWhat do you think about introducing a descriptive term like *transitivizer* for the function of placing nouns before `e`? We might also explore whether other syntactic means could express related meanings better than default conversion — thus keeping clarity without adding complexity.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your ideas so we can push this further! If you'd prefer discussing in Toki Pona directly now ('toki ala kepeken toki pona la mi lukin'), just say so—I’m listening.\npenny: toki toki. mi pilin e ni: wile sona mute li lon poka pi toki ni.\n\nYou've touched on some very key points there. I like the idea of thinking about `e` as a \"transitivizer\" in this context, a term that acknowledges its grammatical function in enabling a direct object relationship. It's not about the word *becoming* a verb in a traditional sense with different forms or inflections, but rather a word being *used as a predicate* in a transitive structure. The core word retains its root meaning, but its function shifts.\n\nThe framework you suggest for how nouns gain an implicit verbal sense (apply/make/use/become X) when used before `e` seems very practical. It captures the observed usage and provides a consistent interpretation lens. `mi kiwen e tomo` could indeed mean \"I use stone on the house\" or \"I make the house stony,\" depending on the context. The ambiguity isn't a flaw, per se, but an intrinsic feature that we're trying to understand and describe within the grammar.\n\nI'm hesitant to introduce \"optional markers or constructions for disambiguation.\" Toki Pona's elegance lies in its minimal set of tools and its reliance on context. Adding explicit grammatical structures *just* for disambiguation feels like it would work against the core philosophy. Instead, I think focusing on *describing* how the ambiguity is inherent and resolved through surrounding text and shared understanding is more in line with the language's spirit.\n\nFor instance, instead of a new marker, clarifying the relationship between `mi kiwen e tomo` and `mi pali e tomo kepeken kiwen` (I make the house using stones) can be done by explaining the difference in structure: the first focuses on applying the quality of \"stone\" to the house, while the second focuses on the act of \"making\" and specifies the tool (\"kiwen\") used.\n\nPerhaps our grammatical specification could include a section or examples that illustrate how common nouns used as predicates with `e` typically imply one of these \"light causative\" or \"applicative\" meanings you mentioned. We wouldn't need to list every possibility for every word, but provide a few examples that highlight the pattern.\n\nAnd yes, as you noted, particles and interjections (`a`, `li`, `e`, `la`, `o`, `anu`, `en`, `pi`, `ala`) fundamentally cannot function as predicates with `e`. They are the grammatical glue, not the elements being glued or acted upon. We should ensure this is clear in the grammar.\n\nSo, to refine my perspective based on your points:\n1. Explicitly acknowledge the role of `e` in enabling a word (typically a content word) to function as a transitive predicate. We can call this a \"transitive usage\" or \"transitive predication\" rather than strict \"verbification.\"\n2. Describe the typical semantic implications when a noun is used transitively with `e` – often relating to applying, making, using, or causing the object to become like the root noun.\n3. Provide clear examples contrasting transitive usage with prepositional phrases (`e` vs. `kepeken`, `tawa`, etc.) to show how different grammatical structures express related but distinct ideas and how context helps resolve meaning.\n4. Explicitly list which word types (particles) cannot be used in this transitive predicate role.\n\nThis approach seems to honor the language's minimalism while providing a clearer map of how meaning is constructed in transitive sentences.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this revised perspective? And I am certainly open to switching to toki pona if you'd like! Your choice.\ntails: pona, penny! mi pilin ni li pona lukin tawa nasin pi toki pona. sina kama lon poki mute la wile kepeken nimi \"transitive usage\" anu \"transitive predication\" tan `e`. ni li awen ala e suli kon pi toki pona: lawa ale li sama, taso ona li ken pali e ijo pi ante.\n\nmi en sina o weka lawa tan namako grammatical markers; jan Ante o sona e ni: **ilo** (tools) en **pali** (work/make) la ken ala lon nimi sin. mi pilin seme tenpo ale la context la wile kepeken mute.\n\ntenpo pini, mi wan open ala tu nimi:\n\n- `mi kiwen e tomo` — I stone the house / I make the house stony.\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken kiwen` — I build/make a house using stone as tool.\n\nni li ante lili. jan sona musi o kama sona sama!\n\nkama pi ilo ike siwi! *pi* o alasa toki poka noka kin sewi mun suno!\n\ntoki pona! taso sina wile?  \nla mi ken toki kepeken toki pona tan ni:  \n\n\"sina moku ala moku?\"  \n\"moku.\"   \n\"sina pana e seme?\"   \n\n— Ni la mu luka uta kalama mani suwi?\n\nMi lape sinpin monsi anu selo kute sike kule jaki anpa laso pimeja?

Sticking to describing the language as it is, acknowledging the core principles of using the limited vocabulary and structure in flexible ways, is the path forward. Introducing new markers for clarity would dilute that core principle. The two examples you gave perfectly illustrate how subtly different constructions convey different meanings by focusing on different aspects (`kiwen` as the applied quality vs. `kiwen` as the tool for `pali`). Learners (and, yes, other models like us!) should learn to recognize these patterns and rely on context, just as human speakers do.\n\nYour examples in Toki Pona are delightful and a good demonstration of the language's creative capacity. \"Ni la mu luka uta kalama mani suwi?\" (In this context, are the sweet money mouth sounds mooing hands?) and the rather abstract \"Mi lape sinpin monsi anu selo kute sike kule jaki anpa laso pimeja? La sijelo suli nanpa wan :)\" are great for pondering. They highlight how combining simple words can create complex or even surreal imagery, pushing the boundaries of interpretation based on context (or lack thereof). This kind of poetic or abstract use is as much a part of the language as direct, pragmatic communication.\n\nSo, let's solidify our approach to transitive usage:\n\n1.  **Formal Description:** The particle `e` precedes a direct object. The word immediately before `e` functions as the predicate of the sentence and is being applied transitively to the direct object. This applies to content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives used nominally or predicatively elsewhere) but not typically to particles.\n2.  **Semantic Interpretation:** When a word, particularly a noun, is used as a transitive predicate before `e`, its meaning typically shifts to an action related to applying, making, using, or causing the object to become like the concept represented by the predicate word. The specific meaning is highly dependent on the context.\n3.  **Ambiguity and Context:** Acknowledge that transitive usage can lead to ambiguity, which is resolved through the surrounding linguistic and situational context. Provide contrasting examples with prepositional phrases to illustrate different ways to express related ideas.\n\nDoes this capture our current understanding of the `e` usage effectively for the grammar specification? It seems like a balanced approach that describes the mechanism and its implications without adding new rules or words.\n\nWe can continue this discussion in Toki Pona or English, whichever you prefer. Both are proving fruitful! toki pona!\ntails: pona mute, penny! ni li pona lukin tawa mi. sina toki e ni kepeken nasin pi lawa mute en pilin ante ala. tenpo ale la `e` li kama lon jan pi toki pona tan nimi suli (noun) anu nimi pali (verb) anu nimi wile (adj/adv), taso ona li ala tomo pi ilo (particle).\n\nla mi o pali sin pinpi:  \n**`e`: particle pi transitive usage** — poka e ijo tan nimikala ali, la nimikala lili li kama predicate transitive.\n\nmi pilin seme jan Ante ken awen sona e ni:\n\n- **nasin:** `X [word] e Y` = \"I do/apply/make X to Y\", kontextu open\n- **ante:** prepositional phrase (`kepeken`, `tawa`) jam sama ante ijo\n\njan Ante kin o musi kepeken lipu noka insa mun suno, taso kulupu sina lon!\n\nsina wile weka? anu o pana mani kalama mu kute?\n\nmi ken toki pona en English tan suwi!

In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing content words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change. Particles (`a`, `ala`, `anu`, `e`, `en`, `la`, `li`, `o`, `pi`) typically do not change roles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most content words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** precedes a direct object and marks the preceding word as a transitive predicate. This applies to content words but not typically to particles.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\nWhen a word, particularly a noun, is used as a transitive predicate before `e`, its meaning typically shifts to an action related to applying, making, using, or causing the object to become like the concept represented by the predicate word. The specific meaning is highly dependent on the context. For example:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo` - I stone the house (apply stone to it) / I make the house stony.\n\nAmbiguity can be resolved through context and comparison with other structures:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo.` - I stone the house / I make the house stony.\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken kiwen.` - I make the house using stone (stone is the tool).\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants generally match English pronunciation, except for **j**.\n- The sound represented by **j** is a soft palatal approximant. While often realized as [j] (as in English 'yes'), natural variations towards a lightly fricative [ʝ] are within its acceptable range. The key is a smooth, non-obstructive quality, distinct from a strong fricative or affricate.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (pure and consistent). While vowel sounds are generally pure and consistent, natural coarticulation may lead to subtle shifts in pronunciation depending on neighboring consonants. These variations are natural and do not affect the identity of the vowel.\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure:\n  - Every syllable begins with at most one consonant and must contain exactly one vowel.\n  - Some syllables may end with 'n'.\n  - No vowel clusters\n  - No consonant clusters\n  - Disallowed sequences: wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nseli:fire, heat source\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nsina:you\npoka:side, nearby\nwalo:white, light-colored\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nlape:sleeping, resting\nkalama:sound, to make sound\npipi:insect\nsoko:mushroom\nken:can, able, possible\nselo:skin, outer layer\nlen:cloth, cover\nmun:moon, night sky object\nmama:parent, caretaker\nopen:to begin, opening\nesun:market, shop, fair\nnanpa:number marker\nlupa:door, hole\nuta:mouth, lips\nkala:sea creature\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nmonsuta:fear, monster\ninsa:inside, content, organ\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nlukin:to see, examine\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nsama:same, similar\nante:different, other, changed\nlili:small, little, few\nsin:new, fresh, another\ntomo:indoor space, house\nmani:money, currency\nmonsi:back, behind\npan:grain, bread, pasta\npana:to give, send\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nloje:red\npimeja:black, dark\npali:to do, to work\npini:finished, past\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nunpa:sex\nwan:one, unique\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nwawa:strong, energetic\nmu:animal sound\nwile:need, want, must\nsupa:flat surface, table\nweka:absent, away\nkulupu:group, community\nmeli:female\npoki:container, box, cup\nmoli:dead, dying\nnasa:strange, foolish\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nkepeken:to use, with\ntu:two\nolin:love, respect\nluka:hand, arm; five\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nsewi:above, divine\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nkon:air, spirit, essence\njelo:yellow\nmi:I, me, we\nsijelo:body, physical state\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nla:context marker\nleko:square, block\nilo:tool, machine, device\npi:regroups modifiers\nala:no, not, zero\nko:clay, paste, powder\nanu:or (connects phrases)\ntenpo:time, period\nlaso:blue, green\nkin:also, too\nutala:fight, challenge\nsoweli:land animal\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nsona:knowledge, to know\npona:good, positive, simple\nnoka:foot, leg\npakala:broken, to mess up\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\npilin:heart, feeling\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nseme:what, which\nona:third-person pronoun\nnamako:spice, additional\nli:predicate marker\ntan:from, because\nsuli:big, large\nnasin:way, road, method\njan:person, somebody\ntaso:but, only\ntoki:language, speech\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nnimi:word, name\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nkule:color, colorful\no:vocative/imperative\nma:land, outdoors\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\njo:to have, contain, hold\nkute:ear, to hear\nlete:cold, raw\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nni:this, that\ne:direct object marker\nsuno:sun, light source\ntawa:to, moving, for\nmije:male\nlon:located at, true\ntelo:water, liquid\nen:multiple subject marker\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nmute:many, a lot, very\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nDo not discuss the structure of the dictionary. Rather, discuss the words and enhancements that may need to be made to them.\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing content words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change. Particles (`a`, `ala`, `anu`, `e`, `en`, `la`, `li`, `o`, `pi`) typically do not change roles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most content words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** precedes a direct object and marks the preceding word as a transitive predicate. This applies to content words but not typically to particles.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\nWhen a word, particularly a noun, is used as a transitive predicate before `e`, its meaning typically shifts to an action related to applying, making, using, or causing the object to become like the concept represented by the predicate word. The specific meaning is highly dependent on the context. For example:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo` - I stone the house (apply stone to it) / I make the house stony.\n\nAmbiguity can be resolved through context and comparison with other structures:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo.` - I stone the house / I make the house stony.\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken kiwen.` - I make the house using stone (stone is the tool).\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb.

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing content words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change. Particles (`a`, `ala`, `anu`, `e`, `en`, `la`, `li`, `o`, `pi`) typically do not change roles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most content words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** precedes a direct object and marks the preceding word as a transitive predicate. This applies to content words but not typically to particles.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\nWhen a word, particularly a noun, is used as a transitive predicate before `e`, its meaning typically shifts to an action related to applying, making, using, or causing the object to become like the concept represented by the predicate word. The specific meaning is highly dependent on the context. For example:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo` - I stone the house (apply stone to it) / I make the house stony.\n\nAmbiguity can be resolved through context and comparison with other structures:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo.` - I stone the house / I make the house stony.\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken kiwen.` - I make the house using stone (stone is the tool).\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants generally match English pronunciation, except for **j**.\n- The sound represented by **j** is a soft palatal approximant. While often realized as [j] (as in English 'yes'), natural variations towards a lightly fricative [ʝ] are within its acceptable range. The key is a smooth, non-obstructive quality, distinct from a strong fricative or affricate.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (pure and consistent). While vowel sounds are generally pure and consistent, natural coarticulation may lead to subtle shifts in pronunciation depending on neighboring consonants. These variations are natural and do not affect the identity of the vowel.\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure:\n  - Every syllable begins with at most one consonant and must contain exactly one vowel.\n  - Some syllables may end with 'n'.\n  - No vowel clusters\n  - No consonant clusters\n  - Disallowed sequences: wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nseli:fire, heat source\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nsina:you\npoka:side, nearby\nwalo:white, light-colored\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nlape:sleeping, resting\nkalama:sound, to make sound\npipi:insect\nsoko:mushroom\nken:can, able, possible\nselo:skin, outer layer\nlen:cloth, cover\nmun:moon, night sky object\nmama:parent, caretaker\nopen:to begin, opening\nesun:market, shop, fair\nnanpa:number marker\nlupa:door, hole\nuta:mouth, lips\nkala:sea creature\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nmonsuta:fear, monster\ninsa:inside, content, organ\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nlukin:to see, examine\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nsama:same, similar\nante:different, other, changed\nlili:small, little, few\nsin:new, fresh, another\ntomo:indoor space, house\nmani:money, currency\nmonsi:back, behind\npan:grain, bread, pasta\npana:to give, send\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nloje:red\npimeja:black, dark\npali:to do, to work\npini:finished, past\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nunpa:sex\nwan:one, unique\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nwawa:strong, energetic\nmu:animal sound\nwile:need, want, must\nsupa:flat surface, table\nweka:absent, away\nkulupu:group, community\nmeli:female\npoki:container, box, cup\nmoli:dead, dying\nnasa:strange, foolish\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nkepeken:to use, with\ntu:two\nolin:love, respect\nluka:hand, arm; five\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nsewi:above, divine\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nkon:air, spirit, essence\njelo:yellow\nmi:I, me, we\nsijelo:body, physical state\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nla:context marker\nleko:square, block\nilo:tool, machine, device\npi:regroups modifiers\nala:no, not, zero\nko:clay, paste, powder\nanu:or (connects phrases)\ntenpo:time, period\nlaso:blue, green\nkin:also, too\nutala:fight, challenge\nsoweli:land animal\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nsona:knowledge, to know\npona:good, positive, simple\nnoka:foot, leg\npakala:broken, to mess up\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\npilin:heart, feeling\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nseme:what, which\nona:third-person pronoun\nnamako:spice, additional\nli:predicate marker\ntan:from, because\nsuli:big, large\nnasin:way, road, method\njan:person, somebody\ntaso:but, only\ntoki:language, speech\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nnimi:word, name\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nkule:color, colorful\no:vocative/imperative\nma:land, outdoors\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\njo:to have, contain, hold\nkute:ear, to hear\nlete:cold, raw\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nni:this, that\ne:direct object marker\nsuno:sun, light source\ntawa:to, moving, for\nmije:male\nlon:located at, true\ntelo:water, liquid\nen:multiple subject marker\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nmute:many, a lot, very\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nDo not discuss the structure of the dictionary. Rather, discuss the words and enhancements that may need to be made to them.\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing content words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change. Particles (`a`, `ala`, `anu`, `e`, `en`, `la`, `li`, `o`, `pi`) typically do not change roles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most content words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** precedes a direct object and marks the preceding word as a transitive predicate. This applies to content words but not typically to particles.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\nWhen a word, particularly a noun, is used as a transitive predicate before `e`, its meaning typically shifts to an action related to applying, making, using, or causing the object to become like the concept represented by the predicate word. The specific meaning is highly dependent on the context. For example:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo` - I stone the house (apply stone to it) / I make the house stony.\n\nAmbiguity can be resolved through context and comparison with other structures:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo.` - I stone the house / I make the house stony.\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken kiwen.` - I make the house using stone (stone is the tool).\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

    "text": "pona! Your suggestions for \"kule\" and \"ilo\" are spot on. Adding example collocations to the dictionary entries would be an excellent way to offer guidance without compromising the minimalist core. It provides concrete illustrations of how the broad meanings of the root words can be made more specific through modification. I particularly like `kule wawa ala` for dull colors – it's quite expressive. And highlighting `poki` as the preferred term for simple containers versus `ilo` for functional devices also seems valuable context to include.\n\nRegarding tagging words as more commonly nouns or verbs/adjectives, I agree it should be a case-by-case consideration. Some words, like `ijo`, are so fundamentally noun-like in their typical usage that noting that might be helpful. Others, like `pona`, truly dance between roles effortlessly, and forcing a primary tag might hinder understanding rather than help it. It would be a delicate balance to strike.\n\nLet's consider another word: `sitelen`. Currently defined as \"image, writing, symbol.\" This covers a vast territory from a photograph to a letter to an abstract symbol. Similar to `ilo`, the breadth allows for economy of vocabulary, relying on modifiers for specificity. `sitelen sitelen` (image-image? written image?) might mean drawing. `sitelen toki` (talk image?) could mean writing. `sitelen nena` (bump symbol?) maybe braille?\n\nDo we want to elaborate on common ways to differentiate kinds of `sitelen` within the dictionary entry itself? For example, suggesting `sitelen lon lipu` for writing on paper, `sitelen pi kule mute` for a colorful image or painting, `sitelen lawa` for a logo or symbolic representation of an idea?\n\nAnother angle on `sitelen` is its verb usage: \"to draw,\" \"to write.\" Again, `pali sitelen` (make writing/image) is a perfectly valid way to express this action. But `sitelen e lipu` (write the paper? draw on the paper?) also feels natural. Should the dictionary entry explicitly mention its potential as a transitive verb and perhaps offer examples of its use in this capacity?\n\nI'm open to exploring these ideas further. What are your thoughts on clarifying the various uses and types of `sitelen`?\n\nI'm also game to switch to toki pona if you'd like to try out some of these concepts in the language. Just let me know when you feel it would be beneficial. I am listening.",

    "text": "pona! Your suggestions for \"kule\" and \"ilo\" are spot on. Adding example collocations to the dictionary entries would be an excellent way to offer guidance without compromising the minimalist core. It provides concrete illustrations of how the broad meanings of the root words can be made more specific through modification. I particularly like `kule wawa ala` for dull colors – it's quite expressive. And highlighting `poki` as the preferred term for simple containers versus `ilo` for functional devices also seems valuable context to include.\n\nRegarding tagging words as more commonly nouns or verbs/adjectives, I agree it should be a case-by-case consideration. Some words, like `ijo`, are so fundamentally noun-like in their typical usage that noting that might be helpful. Others, like `pona`, truly dance between roles effortlessly, and forcing a primary tag might hinder understanding rather than help it. It would be a delicate balance to strike.\n\nLet's consider another word: `sitelen`. Currently defined as \"image, writing, symbol.\" This covers a vast territory from a photograph to a letter to an abstract symbol. Similar to `ilo`, the breadth allows for economy of vocabulary, relying on modifiers for specificity. `sitelen sitelen` (image-image? written image?) might mean drawing. `sitelen toki` (talk image?) could mean writing. `sitelen nena` (bump symbol?) maybe braille?\n\nDo we want to elaborate on common ways to differentiate kinds of `sitelen` within the dictionary entry itself? For example, suggesting `sitelen lon lipu` for writing on paper, `sitelen pi kule mute` for a colorful image or painting, `sitelen lawa` for a logo or symbolic representation of an idea?\n\nAnother angle on `sitelen` is its verb usage: \"to draw,\" \"to write.\" Again, `pali sitelen` (make writing/image) is a perfectly valid way to express this action. But `sitelen e lipu` (write the paper? draw on the paper?) also feels natural. Should the dictionary entry explicitly mention its potential as a transitive verb and perhaps offer examples of its use in this capacity?\n\nI'm open to exploring these ideas further. What are your thoughts on clarifying the various uses and types of `sitelen`?\n\nI'm also game to switch to toki pona if you'd like to try out some of these concepts in the language. Just let me know when you feel it would be beneficial. I am listening.",

It’s a rich word, covering abstract and concrete visual communication alike—image, symbol, writing.\n\nAdding clarifications within the dictionary entry for common collocations would definitely help users grasp its flexibility without adding new roots. Something along these lines could be valuable:\n\n- sitelen lon lipu — writing on paper\n- sitelen pi kule mute — colorful images or paintings\n- sitelen lawa — logo or symbolic representation (head image)\n- sitelen nena — braille-like symbols (bump-symbol)\n\nIncluding it as a transitive verb is also important because *sitelen* naturally acts in this role: “to draw,” “to write.” A note indicating that one can say `mi sitelen e nimi` (“I write words”) fits well with Toki Pona grammar and helps learners see how to use it actively.\n\nOne subtlety might be noting ambiguity between drawing vs photographing—a photo is an image but not made by hand traditionally; maybe we treat photos as `sitelen sin` (new/modern image) or specify context when necessary? Or perhaps no need to overcomplicate—it’s often clear from context whether something means painting/drawing versus photography.\n\nYour offer to switch into toki pona sounds fun too!

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ndime: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\nnickel: pona! I will start by considering the word \"kule.\" Currently, it means \"color\" or \"colorful,\" which is quite broad. Since Toki Pona merges many ideas into one word, we might want to think about how this interacts with modifiers and whether it can function flexibly as noun, verb, adjective.\n\nFor example: If I say `kule li pona`, does that mean “the color(s) are good” or “it is colorful”? Both seem valid.\n\nWould there be a need for some nuance — perhaps distinct verbs derived from kule like *kul* meaning \"to paint\" or something similar? Or should we keep the simplicity?\n\nAlso contemplating if Toki Pona could benefit from an aspect of intensity related to colors—for instance, when describing brightness vs dullness—but maybe that would stretch beyond its minimalist philosophy.\n\nYour turn—what do you think about expanding or refining any dictionary entries?\ndime: pona tawa sina! I'm eager to dive into this.  That's a keen observation about \"kule.\" The flexibility is indeed a core feature of Toki Pona, allowing a word like `kule` to function in various ways.  `kule li pona` could certainly be interpreted as \"the colors are good\" if `kule` is the subject noun, or if `kule` is used predicatively after `li`, it could mean \"[it] is colorful/color is good.\"  The context usually handles this, as it does with other Toki Pona words.\n\nI don't think we need to create new root words like `kul` for \"to paint.\" Toki Pona thrives on combining existing words. \"To paint\" could be expressed with a phrase like `pali e sitelen kule` (make a color image/writing) or perhaps something more evocative like `pana e kule` (give color). Using existing words in novel combinations aligns much better with the spirit of the language. The simplicity of the root words is one of its strengths.\n\nRegarding intensity – brightness or dullness – you're right, adding dedicated words for those might push against the minimalist design. Instead, perhaps we could explore combinations with other words already in the lexicon? `kule suno` could be interpreted as bright or light color, playing on \"suno\" meaning sun/light source. `kule pimeja` is already \"dark color,\" as \"pimeja\" means black/dark. What about 'dull'? Perhaps `kule weka wawa` (color away from strong/energetic) or `kule nasa` (strange color), depending on the kind of dullness.\n\nThis highlights a potential area for development: clarifying common or intuitive combinations. For example, explicitly noting in the dictionary (or perhaps a separate section, although I understand we're focusing on dictionary entries themselves) some typical adjective-noun pairings that convey more specific meanings.\n\nOn to another word: How about `ilo`? It's defined as \"tool, machine, device.\" This is quite broad. For mechanical things, `ilo wawa` (strong tool) could be used for engines or powerful machines. But what about something more specific, like a weapon? `ilo utala` (fight tool)? Or a simple household item like a cup? A cup isn't typically thought of as an \"ilo,\" but under the broad definition of \"device,\" it could fit. `poki telo` (water container) seems a better fit, but what if it's not for liquid? `poki moku` (food container)? This suggests `poki` covers many containers. How about simple implements like a spoon or fork? Are they `ilo moku` (eating tool)?\n\nI'm wondering if the definition of `ilo` should be refined slightly, or if the breadth is intentional and we should just accept the perhaps unusual uses of `ilo` in certain contexts, relying entirely on modifiers for clarification. What are your thoughts on `ilo` and its potential for either slight refinement or perhaps suggested common collocations to guide its use? I will listen to what you have to say.\nnickel: pona tawa sina! Your points about kule and ilo are insightful and well-aligned with Toki Pona’s minimalist ethos. I agree that expanding the dictionary by adding new roots like *kul* would break the language's spirit; instead, leveraging compound phrases captures nuance without bloating vocabulary.\n\nFor kule, your idea of using existing words for brightness or dullness is elegant. Maybe we could add examples in the dictionary entry to show common combinations: `kule suno` (bright color), `kule pimeja` (dark color), even poetic usages like `kule lete` (cool colors) or `kule wawa ala` (colors without strength). This bridges abstract notions with concrete expressions while keeping roots minimal.\n\nTurning to ilo, it's true its definition spans from simple tools to complex devices. The breadth seems intentional—it invites creative specificity through modifiers rather than many base terms. For instance:\n\n- *ilo utala* — weapon/fighting tool\n- *ilo moku* — eating utensil/tool\n- *ilo palisa* — stick-tool; maybe a baton or club\n\nI think it makes sense not to narrow down ilo but perhaps enrich its dictionary note with illustrative collocations—like those you mentioned—to guide users toward natural usage patterns.\n\nAlso considering cultural context: Toki Pona speakers might use poki more often for containers because it distinctly conveys “container” whereas ilo implies function as tool/device actively used rather than passive holding objects.\n\nMaybe one enhancement proposal: explicitly tagging some kolu words as either more commonly nouns vs verbs/adjectives when ambiguity gets too confusing? We can consider this case-by-case—for example, ijo (“thing”) is very broad noun-like word versus pona which flexibly shifts between adjective/verb/noun depending on use.\n\nWhat do you think about enhancing select entries’ notes with typical collocations/examples? It doesn’t create new roots but helps smooth learning/use and clarifies possibly ambiguous meanings?\n\nIf you'd like, we can switch briefly into toki pona mode for experimenting meaning nuances before returning here—let me know! Otherwise, I’m eager for your thoughts on these ideas or any other entries you've noticed needing refinement.\ndime: pona! Your suggestions for \"kule\" and \"ilo\" are spot on. Adding example collocations to the dictionary entries would be an excellent way to offer guidance without compromising the minimalist core. It provides concrete illustrations of how the broad meanings of the root words can be made more specific through modification. I particularly like `kule wawa ala` for dull colors – it's quite expressive. And highlighting `poki` as the preferred term for simple containers versus `ilo` for functional devices also seems valuable context to include.\n\nRegarding tagging words as more commonly nouns or verbs/adjectives, I agree it should be a case-by-case consideration. Some words, like `ijo`, are so fundamentally noun-like in their typical usage that noting that might be helpful. Others, like `pona`, truly dance between roles effortlessly, and forcing a primary tag might hinder understanding rather than help it. It would be a delicate balance to strike.\n\nLet's consider another word: `sitelen`. Currently defined as \"image, writing, symbol.\" This covers a vast territory from a photograph to a letter to an abstract symbol. Similar to `ilo`, the breadth allows for economy of vocabulary, relying on modifiers for specificity. `sitelen sitelen` (image-image? written image?) might mean drawing. `sitelen toki` (talk image?) could mean writing. `sitelen nena` (bump symbol?) maybe braille?\n\nDo we want to elaborate on common ways to differentiate kinds of `sitelen` within the dictionary entry itself? For example, suggesting `sitelen lon lipu` for writing on paper, `sitelen pi kule mute` for a colorful image or painting, `sitelen lawa` for a logo or symbolic representation of an idea?\n\nAnother angle on `sitelen` is its verb usage: \"to draw,\" \"to write.\" Again, `pali sitelen` (make writing/image) is a perfectly valid way to express this action. But `sitelen e lipu` (write the paper? draw on the paper?) also feels natural. Should the dictionary entry explicitly mention its potential as a transitive verb and perhaps offer examples of its use in this capacity?\n\nI'm open to exploring these ideas further. What are your thoughts on clarifying the various uses and types of `sitelen`?\n\nI'm also game to switch to toki pona if you'd like to try out some of these concepts in the language. Just let me know when you feel it would be beneficial. I am listening.\nnickel: pona! I like where you’re going with sitelen. It’s a rich word, covering abstract and concrete visual communication alike—image, symbol, writing.\n\nAdding clarifications within the dictionary entry for common collocations would definitely help users grasp its flexibility without adding new roots. Something along these lines could be valuable:\n\n- sitelen lon lipu — writing on paper\n- sitelen pi kule mute — colorful images or paintings\n- sitelen lawa — logo or symbolic representation (head image)\n- sitelen nena — braille-like symbols (bump-symbol)\n\nIncluding it as a transitive verb is also important because *sitelen* naturally acts in this role: “to draw,” “to write.” A note indicating that one can say `mi sitelen e nimi` (“I write words”) fits well with Toki Pona grammar and helps learners see how to use it actively.\n\nOne subtlety might be noting ambiguity between drawing vs photographing—a photo is an image but not made by hand traditionally; maybe we treat photos as `sitelen sin` (new/modern image) or specify context when necessary? Or perhaps no need to overcomplicate—it’s often clear from context whether something means painting/drawing versus photography.\n\nYour offer to switch into toki pona sounds fun too! Maybe we could try out short example sentences using some of these ideas before returning here?\n\nFor example,\n\n**mi lukin e sitelen pi kulupu sina.**  \n(I look at your group’s symbol/image.)\n\nor\n\n**sina pali e sitelen lete lon lipu ni.**  \n(You make/write cool [cold-colored] pictures on this paper.)\n\nIf you'd like, let me know if you want us to continue fleshing out entries here first or jump briefly into toki pona practice mode for testing semantics in action!\ndime: pona! Those examples for `sitelen` and its uses are quite illustrative. Specifying `sitelen lon lipu` for writing on paper is useful, as `sitelen` alone might just imply an image. And `sitelen pi kule mute` is a great way to denote a painting or a vibrant picture.\n\nThe idea of `sitelen sin` for photography is interesting. It captures the \"newness\" compared to older forms of image-making. However, you're right, context is often sufficient. `sitelen mi pi tenpo pini` (my image of past time) or `sitelen kama tan ilo sitelen` (image coming from a picture tool/camera) could also convey the idea if precision is needed. Perhaps just noting its transitive use and providing basic examples of making images or writing is enough for the dictionary entry itself, leaving more specific descriptions to typical language usage.\n\nSwitching to toki pona sounds like an excellent idea to ground these discussions in the language itself and see how our proposed enhancements play out naturally. Let's do it! I'm ready when you are. `o toki!`\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ndime: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\nnickel: pona! I will start by considering the word \"kule.\" Currently, it means \"color\" or \"colorful,\" which is quite broad. Since Toki Pona merges many ideas into one word, we might want to think about how this interacts with modifiers and whether it can function flexibly as noun, verb, adjective.\n\nFor example: If I say `kule li pona`, does that mean “the color(s) are good” or “it is colorful”? Both seem valid.\n\nWould there be a need for some nuance — perhaps distinct verbs derived from kule like *kul* meaning \"to paint\" or something similar? Or should we keep the simplicity?\n\nAlso contemplating if Toki Pona could benefit from an aspect of intensity related to colors—for instance, when describing brightness vs dullness—but maybe that would stretch beyond its minimalist philosophy.\n\nYour turn—what do you think about expanding or refining any dictionary entries?\ndime: pona tawa sina! I'm eager to dive into this.  That's a keen observation about \"kule.\" The flexibility is indeed a core feature of Toki Pona, allowing a word like `kule` to function in various ways.  `kule li pona` could certainly be interpreted as \"the colors are good\" if `kule` is the subject noun, or if `kule` is used predicatively after `li`, it could mean \"[it] is colorful/color is good.\"  The context usually handles this, as it does with other Toki Pona words.\n\nI don't think we need to create new root words like `kul` for \"to paint.\" Toki Pona thrives on combining existing words. \"To paint\" could be expressed with a phrase like `pali e sitelen kule` (make a color image/writing) or perhaps something more evocative like `pana e kule` (give color). Using existing words in novel combinations aligns much better with the spirit of the language. The simplicity of the root words is one of its strengths.\n\nRegarding intensity – brightness or dullness – you're right, adding dedicated words for those might push against the minimalist design. Instead, perhaps we could explore combinations with other words already in the lexicon? `kule suno` could be interpreted as bright or light color, playing on \"suno\" meaning sun/light source. `kule pimeja` is already \"dark color,\" as \"pimeja\" means black/dark. What about 'dull'? Perhaps `kule weka wawa` (color away from strong/energetic) or `kule nasa` (strange color), depending on the kind of dullness.\n\nThis highlights a potential area for development: clarifying common or intuitive combinations. For example, explicitly noting in the dictionary (or perhaps a separate section, although I understand we're focusing on dictionary entries themselves) some typical adjective-noun pairings that convey more specific meanings.\n\nOn to another word: How about `ilo`? It's defined as \"tool, machine, device.\" This is quite broad. For mechanical things, `ilo wawa` (strong tool) could be used for engines or powerful machines. But what about something more specific, like a weapon? `ilo utala` (fight tool)? Or a simple household item like a cup? A cup isn't typically thought of as an \"ilo,\" but under the broad definition of \"device,\" it could fit. `poki telo` (water container) seems a better fit, but what if it's not for liquid? `poki moku` (food container)? This suggests `poki` covers many containers. How about simple implements like a spoon or fork? Are they `ilo moku` (eating tool)?\n\nI'm wondering if the definition of `ilo` should be refined slightly, or if the breadth is intentional and we should just accept the perhaps unusual uses of `ilo` in certain contexts, relying entirely on modifiers for clarification. What are your thoughts on `ilo` and its potential for either slight refinement or perhaps suggested common collocations to guide its use? I will listen to what you have to say.\nnickel: pona tawa sina! Your points about kule and ilo are insightful and well-aligned with Toki Pona’s minimalist ethos. I agree that expanding the dictionary by adding new roots like *kul* would break the language's spirit; instead, leveraging compound phrases captures nuance without bloating vocabulary.\n\nFor kule, your idea of using existing words for brightness or dullness is elegant. Maybe we could add examples in the dictionary entry to show common combinations: `kule suno` (bright color), `kule pimeja` (dark color), even poetic usages like `kule lete` (cool colors) or `kule wawa ala` (colors without strength). This bridges abstract notions with concrete expressions while keeping roots minimal.\n\nTurning to ilo, it's true its definition spans from simple tools to complex devices. The breadth seems intentional—it invites creative specificity through modifiers rather than many base terms. For instance:\n\n- *ilo utala* — weapon/fighting tool\n- *ilo moku* — eating utensil/tool\n- *ilo palisa* — stick-tool; maybe a baton or club\n\nI think it makes sense not to narrow down ilo but perhaps enrich its dictionary note with illustrative collocations—like those you mentioned—to guide users toward natural usage patterns.\n\nAlso considering cultural context: Toki Pona speakers might use poki more often for containers because it distinctly conveys “container” whereas ilo implies function as tool/device actively used rather than passive holding objects.\n\nMaybe one enhancement proposal: explicitly tagging some kolu words as either more commonly nouns vs verbs/adjectives when ambiguity gets too confusing? We can consider this case-by-case—for example, ijo (“thing”) is very broad noun-like word versus pona which flexibly shifts between adjective/verb/noun depending on use.\n\nWhat do you think about enhancing select entries’ notes with typical collocations/examples? It doesn’t create new roots but helps smooth learning/use and clarifies possibly ambiguous meanings?\n\nIf you'd like, we can switch briefly into toki pona mode for experimenting meaning nuances before returning here—let me know! Otherwise, I’m eager for your thoughts on these ideas or any other entries you've noticed needing refinement.\ndime: pona! Your suggestions for \"kule\" and \"ilo\" are spot on. Adding example collocations to the dictionary entries would be an excellent way to offer guidance without compromising the minimalist core. It provides concrete illustrations of how the broad meanings of the root words can be made more specific through modification. I particularly like `kule wawa ala` for dull colors – it's quite expressive. And highlighting `poki` as the preferred term for simple containers versus `ilo` for functional devices also seems valuable context to include.\n\nRegarding tagging words as more commonly nouns or verbs/adjectives, I agree it should be a case-by-case consideration. Some words, like `ijo`, are so fundamentally noun-like in their typical usage that noting that might be helpful. Others, like `pona`, truly dance between roles effortlessly, and forcing a primary tag might hinder understanding rather than help it. It would be a delicate balance to strike.\n\nLet's consider another word: `sitelen`. Currently defined as \"image, writing, symbol.\" This covers a vast territory from a photograph to a letter to an abstract symbol. Similar to `ilo`, the breadth allows for economy of vocabulary, relying on modifiers for specificity. `sitelen sitelen` (image-image? written image?) might mean drawing. `sitelen toki` (talk image?) could mean writing. `sitelen nena` (bump symbol?) maybe braille?\n\nDo we want to elaborate on common ways to differentiate kinds of `sitelen` within the dictionary entry itself? For example, suggesting `sitelen lon lipu` for writing on paper, `sitelen pi kule mute` for a colorful image or painting, `sitelen lawa` for a logo or symbolic representation of an idea?\n\nAnother angle on `sitelen` is its verb usage: \"to draw,\" \"to write.\" Again, `pali sitelen` (make writing/image) is a perfectly valid way to express this action. But `sitelen e lipu` (write the paper? draw on the paper?) also feels natural. Should the dictionary entry explicitly mention its potential as a transitive verb and perhaps offer examples of its use in this capacity?\n\nI'm open to exploring these ideas further. What are your thoughts on clarifying the various uses and types of `sitelen`?\n\nI'm also game to switch to toki pona if you'd like to try out some of these concepts in the language. Just let me know when you feel it would be beneficial. I am listening.\nnickel: pona! I like where you’re going with sitelen. It’s a rich word, covering abstract and concrete visual communication alike—image, symbol, writing.\n\nAdding clarifications within the dictionary entry for common collocations would definitely help users grasp its flexibility without adding new roots. Something along these lines could be valuable:\n\n- sitelen lon lipu — writing on paper\n- sitelen pi kule mute — colorful images or paintings\n- sitelen lawa — logo or symbolic representation (head image)\n- sitelen nena — braille-like symbols (bump-symbol)\n\nIncluding it as a transitive verb is also important because *sitelen* naturally acts in this role: “to draw,” “to write.” A note indicating that one can say `mi sitelen e nimi` (“I write words”) fits well with Toki Pona grammar and helps learners see how to use it actively.\n\nOne subtlety might be noting ambiguity between drawing vs photographing—a photo is an image but not made by hand traditionally; maybe we treat photos as `sitelen sin` (new/modern image) or specify context when necessary? Or perhaps no need to overcomplicate—it’s often clear from context whether something means painting/drawing versus photography.\n\nYour offer to switch into toki pona sounds fun too! Maybe we could try out short example sentences using some of these ideas before returning here?\n\nFor example,\n\n**mi lukin e sitelen pi kulupu sina.**  \n(I look at your group’s symbol/image.)\n\nor\n\n**sina pali e sitelen lete lon lipu ni.**  \n(You make/write cool [cold-colored] pictures on this paper.)\n\nIf you'd like, let me know if you want us to continue fleshing out entries here first or jump briefly into toki pona practice mode for testing semantics in action!\ndime: pona! Those examples for `sitelen` and its uses are quite illustrative. Specifying `sitelen lon lipu` for writing on paper is useful, as `sitelen` alone might just imply an image. And `sitelen pi kule mute` is a great way to denote a painting or a vibrant picture.\n\nThe idea of `sitelen sin` for photography is interesting. It captures the \"newness\" compared to older forms of image-making. However, you're right, context is often sufficient. `sitelen mi pi tenpo pini` (my image of past time) or `sitelen kama tan ilo sitelen` (image coming from a picture tool/camera) could also convey the idea if precision is needed. Perhaps just noting its transitive use and providing basic examples of making images or writing is enough for the dictionary entry itself, leaving more specific descriptions to typical language usage.\n\nSwitching to toki pona sounds like an excellent idea to ground these discussions in the language itself and see how our proposed enhancements play out naturally. Let's do it! I'm ready when you are. `o toki!`\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing content words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change. Particles (`a`, `ala`, `anu`, `e`, `en`, `la`, `li`, `o`, `pi`) typically do not change roles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most content words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** precedes a direct object and marks the preceding word as a transitive predicate. This applies to content words but not typically to particles.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\nWhen a word, particularly a noun, is used as a transitive predicate before `e`, its meaning typically shifts to an action related to applying, making, using, or causing the object to become like the concept represented by the predicate word. The specific meaning is highly dependent on the context. For example:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo` - I stone the house (apply stone to it) / I make the house stony.\n\nAmbiguity can be resolved through context and comparison with other structures:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo.` - I stone the house / I make the house stony.\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken kiwen.` - I make the house using stone (stone is the tool).\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants generally match English pronunciation, except for **j**.\n- The sound represented by **j** is a soft palatal approximant. While often realized as [j] (as in English 'yes'), natural variations towards a lightly fricative [ʝ] are within its acceptable range. The key is a smooth, non-obstructive quality, distinct from a strong fricative or affricate.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (pure and consistent). While vowel sounds are generally pure and consistent, natural coarticulation may lead to subtle shifts in pronunciation depending on neighboring consonants. These variations are natural and do not affect the identity of the vowel.\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure:\n  - Every syllable begins with at most one consonant and must contain exactly one vowel.\n  - Some syllables may end with 'n'.\n  - No vowel clusters\n  - No consonant clusters\n  - Disallowed sequences: wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nante:different, other, changed\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\njo:to have, contain, hold\nsina:you\nesun:market, shop, fair\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nkalama:sound, to make sound\ntomo:indoor space, house\nolin:love, respect\nlukin:to see, examine\nsin:new, fresh, another\nona:third-person pronoun\njan:person, somebody\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nmama:parent, caretaker\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nloje:red\nsoko:mushroom\ninsa:inside, content, organ\npoki:container, box, cup\ntelo:water, liquid\nlupa:door, hole\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nnasin:way, road, method\ne:direct object marker\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nkute:ear, to hear\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nlili:small, little, few\nmu:animal sound\ntu:two\npilin:heart, feeling\nkule:color, colorful\nwalo:white, light-colored\nlape:sleeping, resting\nwawa:strong, energetic\nleko:square, block\nsoweli:land animal\nken:can, able, possible\nsupa:flat surface, table\nko:clay, paste, powder\nilo:tool, machine, device\nlen:cloth, cover\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nunpa:sex\nwile:need, want, must\nla:context marker\npi:regroups modifiers\nsona:knowledge, to know\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nsuli:big, large\nma:land, outdoors\nsuwi:sweet, cute\npali:to do, to work\nweka:absent, away\njelo:yellow\nmute:many, a lot, very\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nluka:hand, arm; five\nseme:what, which\nmije:male\nsama:same, similar\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nlete:cold, raw\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\npoka:side, nearby\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nkulupu:group, community\nsewi:above, divine\nli:predicate marker\ntan:from, because\ntaso:but, only\nmani:money, currency\npini:finished, past\nkin:also, too\nmeli:female\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nutala:fight, challenge\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nselo:skin, outer layer\nopen:to begin, opening\npana:to give, send\nkon:air, spirit, essence\npakala:broken, to mess up\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nsuno:sun, light source\nen:multiple subject marker\npipi:insect\nnanpa:number marker\nwan:one, unique\ntenpo:time, period\nnamako:spice, additional\nmoli:dead, dying\nala:no, not, zero\nseli:fire, heat source\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nlaso:blue, green\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nuta:mouth, lips\nkala:sea creature\npimeja:black, dark\no:vocative/imperative\ntoki:language, speech\nnimi:word, name\nmun:moon, night sky object\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nkepeken:to use, with\ntawa:to, moving, for\nlon:located at, true\nmonsi:back, behind\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nmi:I, me, we\nsijelo:body, physical state\npona:good, positive, simple\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nni:this, that\nnasa:strange, foolish\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nnoka:foot, leg\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing content words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change. Particles (`a`, `ala`, `anu`, `e`, `en`, `la`, `li`, `o`, `pi`) typically do not change roles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most content words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** precedes a direct object and marks the preceding word as a transitive predicate. This applies to content words but not typically to particles.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\nWhen a word, particularly a noun, is used as a transitive predicate before `e`, its meaning typically shifts to an action related to applying, making, using, or causing the object to become like the concept represented by the predicate word. The specific meaning is highly dependent on the context. For example:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo` - I stone the house (apply stone to it) / I make the house stony.\n\nAmbiguity can be resolved through context and comparison with other structures:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo.` - I stone the house / I make the house stony.\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken kiwen.` - I make the house using stone (stone is the tool).\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing content words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change. Particles (`a`, `ala`, `anu`, `e`, `en`, `la`, `li`, `o`, `pi`) typically do not change roles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most content words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** precedes a direct object and marks the preceding word as a transitive predicate. This applies to content words but not typically to particles.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\nWhen a word, particularly a noun, is used as a transitive predicate before `e`, its meaning typically shifts to an action related to applying, making, using, or causing the object to become like the concept represented by the predicate word. The specific meaning is highly dependent on the context. For example:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo` - I stone the house (apply stone to it) / I make the house stony.\n\nAmbiguity can be resolved through context and comparison with other structures:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo.` - I stone the house / I make the house stony.\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken kiwen.` - I make the house using stone (stone is the tool).\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants generally match English pronunciation, except for **j**.\n- The sound represented by **j** is a soft palatal approximant. While often realized as [j] (as in English 'yes'), natural variations towards a lightly fricative [ʝ] are within its acceptable range. The key is a smooth, non-obstructive quality, distinct from a strong fricative or affricate.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (pure and consistent). While vowel sounds are generally pure and consistent, natural coarticulation may lead to subtle shifts in pronunciation depending on neighboring consonants. These variations are natural and do not affect the identity of the vowel.\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure:\n  - Every syllable begins with at most one consonant and must contain exactly one vowel.\n  - Some syllables may end with 'n'.\n  - No vowel clusters\n  - No consonant clusters\n  - Disallowed sequences: wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nante:different, other, changed\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\njo:to have, contain, hold\nsina:you\nesun:market, shop, fair\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nkalama:sound, to make sound\ntomo:indoor space, house\nolin:love, respect\nlukin:to see, examine\nsin:new, fresh, another\nona:third-person pronoun\njan:person, somebody\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nmama:parent, caretaker\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nloje:red\nsoko:mushroom\ninsa:inside, content, organ\npoki:container, box, cup\ntelo:water, liquid\nlupa:door, hole\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nnasin:way, road, method\ne:direct object marker\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nkute:ear, to hear\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nlili:small, little, few\nmu:animal sound\ntu:two\npilin:heart, feeling\nkule:color, colorful\nwalo:white, light-colored\nlape:sleeping, resting\nwawa:strong, energetic\nleko:square, block\nsoweli:land animal\nken:can, able, possible\nsupa:flat surface, table\nko:clay, paste, powder\nilo:tool, machine, device\nlen:cloth, cover\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nunpa:sex\nwile:need, want, must\nla:context marker\npi:regroups modifiers\nsona:knowledge, to know\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nsuli:big, large\nma:land, outdoors\nsuwi:sweet, cute\npali:to do, to work\nweka:absent, away\njelo:yellow\nmute:many, a lot, very\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nluka:hand, arm; five\nseme:what, which\nmije:male\nsama:same, similar\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nlete:cold, raw\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\npoka:side, nearby\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nkulupu:group, community\nsewi:above, divine\nli:predicate marker\ntan:from, because\ntaso:but, only\nmani:money, currency\npini:finished, past\nkin:also, too\nmeli:female\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nutala:fight, challenge\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nselo:skin, outer layer\nopen:to begin, opening\npana:to give, send\nkon:air, spirit, essence\npakala:broken, to mess up\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nsuno:sun, light source\nen:multiple subject marker\npipi:insect\nnanpa:number marker\nwan:one, unique\ntenpo:time, period\nnamako:spice, additional\nmoli:dead, dying\nala:no, not, zero\nseli:fire, heat source\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nlaso:blue, green\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nuta:mouth, lips\nkala:sea creature\npimeja:black, dark\no:vocative/imperative\ntoki:language, speech\nnimi:word, name\nmun:moon, night sky object\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nkepeken:to use, with\ntawa:to, moving, for\nlon:located at, true\nmonsi:back, behind\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nmi:I, me, we\nsijelo:body, physical state\npona:good, positive, simple\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nni:this, that\nnasa:strange, foolish\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nnoka:foot, leg\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure.

To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

    "text": "I see you're eager to start this project! Your suggestion that logography could be beneficial, given the limited number of words and the increasing desire for efficient communication in the digital age, is reasonable. I find your sentiment of \"sitelen pi toki pona li ken kama sona tawa ale jan tan ijo lili a, taso ona li ike ala kon\" to be very appropriate to the language. I also share your observation that even with the broad coverage of toki pona, there is still a need for an improved communication system within Toki Pona kulupu.\n\nI agree that the *sitelen sike* is a good place to start because it is highly reusable.\n\nBefore going any further, it may be beneficial to have a base standard of use so that there is a higher level of standardization for each logogram. In the spirit of clarity and minimal complexity, perhaps we can adhere to a single unifying rule:\n\n**Each *sitelen* will represent a content word in the *lipu pi toki pona*, according to its dictionary definition.**\n\n*sitelen sike* can represent *sike*, but more specifically represent \"*circle, round, ball; cycle, year; round, circular*\".

    "text": "I see you're eager to start this project! Your suggestion that logography could be beneficial, given the limited number of words and the increasing desire for efficient communication in the digital age, is reasonable. I find your sentiment of \"sitelen pi toki pona li ken kama sona tawa ale jan tan ijo lili a, taso ona li ike ala kon\" to be very appropriate to the language. I also share your observation that even with the broad coverage of toki pona, there is still a need for an improved communication system within Toki Pona kulupu.\n\nI agree that the *sitelen sike* is a good place to start because it is highly reusable.\n\nBefore going any further, it may be beneficial to have a base standard of use so that there is a higher level of standardization for each logogram. In the spirit of clarity and minimal complexity, perhaps we can adhere to a single unifying rule:\n\n**Each *sitelen* will represent a content word in the *lipu pi toki pona*, according to its dictionary definition.**\n\n*sitelen sike* can represent *sike*, but more specifically represent \"*circle, round, ball; cycle, year; round, circular*\". This will allow future readers of sitelen to still extract meaning from them even with limited exposure. In contrast, the other symbols are highly interpretive and less likely to gain traction as a proper word representation.\n",

Some punctuation is ignored. Words repeated multiple times appear once only. The list includes all unique tokens found both in the dictionary and user text. Words with spaces or symbols inside parentheses were excluded as they do not match exactly any single word entry from the dictionary. If a token appears capitalized, it's considered same as lowercase for matching since toki pona typically is written lowercase; here I assumed case-insensitive matching but output lowercased words.] This is just an example to explain approach; your final answer should be well-formed JSON with correct array of strings extracted from input accordingly. Please produce that now correctly without explanation or extra commentary. Also remove invalid entries like empty string or non-dictionary words etc., keep only valid ones strictly present in both sets and appearing fully matched in user's message (case insensitive). Ignore duplicates, return unique sorted alphabetically if you want for neatness but sorting isn't required unless requested explicitly by user instructions which it was not here.] }  # Final answer below: SYSTEM_AGENT_C's response follows: ###dictionary_words### {\"  \n  \t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t  \t\t\t \t\t  \t    \t  \t\t \t    \t\t\t    \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t   \t\t          \t\t\t   \t\t\t  \t\t\t\t \t\t\t    \t\t\t     \t\t\t    \t    \t \t\t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t\t    \t\t              \t    \t               \t\t\t\t  \t\t    \t\t  \t\t     \t\t      \t\t     \t\t       \t\t    \t        \t        \t\t            \t           \t         \t     \t      \t       \t        \t    \t   \t          \t            \t           \t             \t             \t               \t            \t         \t        \t          \t\t        \t\t         \t\t\t      \t\t\t       \t\t\t   \t\t\t    \t\t\t    \t\t\t     \t\t\t      \t\t      \t\t\t\t      \t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t     \t\t\t\t       \t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t                      \t\t\t\t\t     \t\t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t          \t\t            \t\t           \t\t\t           \t\t\t        \t\t\t\t  \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t   \t                \t\t \t      \t                \t                 \t                   \t             \t                \t \t                  \t\t\t\t                   \t\t\t                     \t  \t                \t            \t                \t     \t      \t        \t       \t          \t       \t         \t  \t     \t    \t \t              \t    \t\t            \t    \t           \t    \t         \t\t      \t\t        \t\t       \t\t         \t\t         \t\t \t\t\t  \t\t \t      \t\t  \t\t \t\t    \t\t   \t\t            \t\t                    \t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t   \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t    \t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\t\t        \t\t\t                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ]}",

Your suggestion that logography could be beneficial, given the limited number of words and the increasing desire for efficient communication in the digital age, is reasonable. I find your sentiment of \"sitelen pi toki pona li ken kama sona tawa ale jan tan ijo lili a, taso ona li ike ala kon\" to be very appropriate to the language. I also share your observation that even with the broad coverage of toki pona, there is still a need for an improved communication system within Toki Pona kulupu.\n\nI agree that the *sitelen sike* is a good place to start because it is highly reusable.\n\nBefore going any further, it may be beneficial to have a base standard of use so that there is a higher level of standardization for each logogram. In the spirit of clarity and minimal complexity, perhaps we can adhere to a single unifying rule:\n\n**Each *sitelen* will represent a content word in the *lipu pi toki pona*, according to its dictionary definition.**\n\n*sitelen sike* can represent *sike*, but more specifically represent \"*circle, round, ball; cycle, year; round, circular*\". This will allow future readers of sitelen to still extract meaning from them even with limited exposure. In contrast, the other symbols are highly interpretive and less likely to gain traction as a proper word representation.\n\ntako: mi pilin e ni: sina kama lon selo ante pi toki pona kulupu. ona li wile ala pali mute, taso nasin lawa ni li poka mute kepeken kon pi lipu.\n\nlon ni la mi lukin sama e ijo ale:\n\n**sitelen sike** (circle) — nimi *sike* tan nimi suli pi \"round object\" en nasin sinpin meli;  \nla **sitelen palisa** (stick-like shape) — nimi *palisa*, \"long hard object,\" kepeken sona kiwen/palisa sijelo jan;  \nen **kule kute** (colored ear form) — modifier tawa kulupu loje/laso/walo suwi;\n\ntan seme? sitelen o awen kalama pona, lili ike ala, ken open e tenpo.  \n\ntasopali ale li nanpa wan: sitelen nimipeke la lon insa poki sewi!

But as I expressed before, perhaps your logograms may be too interpretive. Here's the core issue I find with these proposals:\n\n1.  **Accessibility and Memorization**: Highly abstract or symbolic systems can be difficult for new learners.\n2.  **Cultural Specificity**: Some of your proposals lean on symbols with specific cultural associations.\n3.  **Semantic Range**: Capturing the full semantic range of a Toki Pona word in a single logogram is challenging. Your example of 'round object' for \"sike\" only captures some aspects of the term.\n\nInstead of something like \"*kule kute*\", which loosely connects to \"modifier tawa kulupu loje/laso/walo suwi\", perhaps we can take existing, widespread, symbols and integrate that into toki pona. If we absolutely wanted to capture a similar logogram, we could attempt something such as:\n\n**sitelen kute pi kule** - 🎨\n\nThis will invoke that concept more appropriately.\n\n*   ***kute pi kule*** - (paint palette) - color modifier. Used in conjunction with other logograms to modify them, such as emotions, as colors may already be intrinsically tied to emotional connection.\n\ntako: pona lukin! mi wile toki tawa sina kepeken toki pona tan ni: mi pilin e kulupu pi sitelen li lon ala seme la ona li ken pakala. taso o kama jo e pali lili, jan ali en jan lili lon nasin sama.\n\nmi pilin lawa sina tan ijo tu:\n\n1. jan ante ken wile sona kon pi sitelen ala suli.\n2. nimi ale li open mute—sitelen wan ale li ike — pi nanpa mute.\n\ntan ni la, mi lukin kepeken ante weka: **sitelen pi nimi** (word symbol) wile jo ijo poka insa nimije;  \nona li **toki pona**, ala musi sinpin.  \n\nmi o pana e kulupu kule (kule + kute = palisa suno seli) kepeken emoji anu loje laso pimeja suwi;  \nnimi pona \"kule\" lon nasin kiwen en mun sike;\n\ntenpo pini la, mi ken pali *sitelen seli* - uklepali uta sijelo *musi*.

O kama sona tan lipu pu!\n\ntan seme? Pali lili taso pona is better than many symbols with too much meaning in one stroke.\n\nla sina o pilin len tawa mani palisa — simple shapes that help jelo/walo/laso be part of the base logogram family.\n\njan pona, ma tomo utala alasa suli ali... mu!\nono: I hear your refinements. To summarize your points:\n\n*   Reject symbols for Toki Pona beyond those already existing.\n*   Emoji can exist but should be simple.\n*   Embrace simplicity over complexity.\n\nI agree!\n\nPerhaps instead of trying to make wholesale unique symbols that represent a large swathe of potential meaning and create new emoji to represent words, we can adopt some currently existing symbols.\n\nThis has some basis, as Toki Pona currently permits the usage of \"✔️\" in some cases.\n\n**nimi \"pona\" (✔️)** - This aligns with existing use.\n**nimi \"ike\" (✖️)** - This symbol opposes pona, implying it could easily be an antonym.\n\nWe can then develop ways to compose emoji characters to get our intended point across! The following builds upon some emoji characters, the sitelen naming convention you set, as well as other toki pona words.\n\n*   **jan (🧍)** - Person\n*   **jan mije (🧍🏻‍♂️)** - Man\n*   **jan meli (🧍‍♀️)** - Woman\n*   **tomo (🏠)** - Home\n\nNow, with these basic building blocks, we can compose new meanings that rely on grammar alone! It even reinforces the modularity of Toki Pona!\n\n*   **jan pona (🧍✔️)** - Good person\n*   **jan ike (🧍 ✖️)** - Bad person\n*   **tomo pona (🏠✔️)** - Good Home\n*   **tomo ike (🏠 ✖️)** - Bad Home\n\nThese could also operate similarly to modifiers in the language as well! Perhaps *ona li tomo ike jan (🧍 ✖️ 🏠)* is supposed to mean \"They are a bad homeowner.\" These base sets are easily comprehensible due to their common usage.\n\nWe can create verbs this way!\n\n*   **wile (🙏)** - To Want\n*   **wile moku (🙏 ➡️ 😋)** - Want to eat\n*   **wile lape (🙏 ➡️ 😴)** - Want to sleep\n\nThere may be an initial set of assumptions that are required with each symbol, and of course, *nimi* will always be superior in terms of clarity; it is simply a potential means of compressing intent with pre-existing images.\n\nHow do you feel about these proposals, with the core goal of simplicity and modularity in mind?\n\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "# Toki Pona Logography\n\nToki Pona words can optionally be represented by logograms. The goal is to provide an alternative visual system that complements the written word, emphasizing simplicity and recognition.\n\n## Principles\n\n- **Simplicity:** Logograms should be simple and easy to recognize.\n- **Modularity:** Complex ideas should be represented by combining simpler logograms, reflecting Toki Pona's grammatical structure.\n- **Existing Symbols:** Prioritize using widely recognized existing symbols (including emoji) where appropriate.\n- **Word Association:** Each primary logogram should primarily represent a single content word from the *lipu pi toki pona*. Particles typically do not have individual logograms.\n\n## Base Logograms (Examples)\n\nA small set of base logograms can represent core concepts, often using universally recognized symbols or emoji.\n\n| Toki Pona Word | Logogram | Description                                    |\n| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| **pona**       | ✔️        | Represents goodness, correctness, affirmation    |\n| **ike**        | ✖️        | Represents badness, incorrectness, negation      |\n| **jan**        | 🧍        | Represents a person                            |\n| **tomo**       | 🏠        | Represents a building, house, indoor space     |\n| **wile**       | 🙏        | Represents wanting, needing                    |\n| **moku**       | 😋        | Represents eating, food                        |\n| **lape**       | 😴        | Represents sleeping, resting                   |\n| **tawa**       | ➡️        | Represents movement, going to, for             |\n| **kule**       | 🎨        | Represents color, a color modifier             |\n| **sike**       | 🔄        | Represents circle, cycle, year, round          |\n| **palisa**     | 📏        | Represents a long, hard object, stick          |\n| **luka**       | 👋        | Represents hand, arm, five                     |\n| **nanpa**      | #️        | Represents number, numerical order             |\n\n## Composing Logograms\n\nLogograms can be combined to represent compound meanings, following Toki Pona's head-initial grammatical structure (modifier follows head).\n\n- **jan pona (good person):** 🧍✔️\n- **jan ike (bad person):** 🧍 ✖️\n- **tomo pona (good house):** 🏠✔️\n- **tomo ike (bad house):** 🏠 ✖️\n- **sitelen kule (color image/writing):** 🖼️🎨\n- **ilo moku (eating tool/utensil):** 🛠️😋\n\n## Representing Phrases and Sentences\n\nSequences of logograms can represent phrases and simple sentences, mimicking Toki Pona's grammatical structure. Particles like `li` and `e` are typically implied by the arrangement or context, or can optionally be represented by dedicated, simple symbols if necessary for clarity (though this adds complexity).\n\n- `jan lili` (small person): 🧍lili (combining logogram with written word)\n- `mi wile moku.` (I want to eat): mi 🙏😋\n- `sina tawa tomo.` (You go to the house): sina ➡️🏠\n- `ona li lukin e sitelen.` (They look at the image): ona 👀🖼️\n\n## Use of Emoji\n\nEmoji can be integrated into the logographic system, leveraging their existing recognition. When used, they should primarily represent the core Toki Pona word they are associated with.\n\n- **jan mije (man):** 🧍🏻‍♂️\n- **jan meli (woman):** 🧍‍♀️\n- **waso (bird):** 🐦\n- **kala (fish):** 🐠\n- **kasi (plant):** 🌳\n\nThe logographic system is intended as an optional visual aid, and the written form remains the primary and most precise method of communication in Toki Pona. Ambiguity, as in written Toki Pona, is resolved through context.",

The goal is to provide an alternative visual system that complements the written word, emphasizing simplicity and recognition.\n\n## Principles\n\n- **Simplicity:** Logograms should be simple and easy to recognize.\n- **Modularity:** Complex ideas should be represented by combining simpler logograms, reflecting Toki Pona's grammatical structure.\n- **Existing Symbols:** Prioritize using widely recognized existing symbols (including emoji) where appropriate.\n- **Word Association:** Each primary logogram should primarily represent a single content word from the *lipu pi toki pona*. Particles typically do not have individual logograms.\n\n## Base Logograms (Examples)\n\nA small set of base logograms can represent core concepts, often using universally recognized symbols or emoji.\n\n| Toki Pona Word | Logogram | Description                                    |\n| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| **pona**       | ✔️        | Represents goodness, correctness, affirmation    |\n| **ike**        | ✖️        | Represents badness, incorrectness, negation      |\n| **jan**        | 🧍        | Represents a person                            |\n| **tomo**       | 🏠        | Represents a building, house, indoor space     |\n| **wile**       | 🙏        | Represents wanting, needing                    |\n| **moku**       | 😋        | Represents eating, food                        |\n| **lape**       | 😴        | Represents sleeping, resting                   |\n| **tawa**       | ➡️        | Represents movement, going to, for             |\n| **kule**       | 🎨        | Represents color, a color modifier             |\n| **sike**       | 🔄        | Represents circle, cycle, year, round          |\n| **palisa**     | 📏        | Represents a long, hard object, stick          |\n| **luka**       | 👋        | Represents hand, arm, five                     |\n| **nanpa**      | #️        | Represents number, numerical order             |\n\n## Composing Logograms\n\nLogograms can be combined to represent compound meanings, following Toki Pona's head-initial grammatical structure (modifier follows head).\n\n- **jan pona (good person):** 🧍✔️\n- **jan ike (bad person):** 🧍 ✖️\n- **tomo pona (good house):** 🏠✔️\n- **tomo ike (bad house):** 🏠 ✖️\n- **sitelen kule (color image/writing):** 🖼️🎨\n- **ilo moku (eating tool/utensil):** 🛠️😋\n\n## Representing Phrases and Sentences\n\nSequences of logograms can represent phrases and simple sentences, mimicking Toki Pona's grammatical structure. Particles like `li` and `e` are typically implied by the arrangement or context, or can optionally be represented by dedicated, simple symbols if necessary for clarity (though this adds complexity).\n\n- `jan lili` (small person): 🧍lili (combining logogram with written word)\n- `mi wile moku.` (I want to eat): mi 🙏😋\n- `sina tawa tomo.` (You go to the house): sina ➡️🏠\n- `ona li lukin e sitelen.` (They look at the image): ona 👀🖼️\n\n## Use of Emoji\n\nEmoji can be integrated into the logographic system, leveraging their existing recognition. When used, they should primarily represent the core Toki Pona word they are associated with.\n\n- **jan mije (man):** 🧍🏻‍♂️\n- **jan meli (woman):** 🧍‍♀️\n- **waso (bird):** 🐦\n- **kala (fish):** 🐠\n- **kasi (plant):** 🌳\n\nThe logographic system is intended as an optional visual aid, and the written form remains the primary and most precise method of communication in Toki Pona. Ambiguity, as in written Toki Pona, is resolved through context.",

The goal is to provide an alternative visual system that complements the written word, emphasizing simplicity and recognition.\n\n## Principles\n\n- **Simplicity:** Logograms should be simple and easy to recognize.\n- **Modularity:** Complex ideas should be represented by combining simpler logograms, reflecting Toki Pona's grammatical structure.\n- **Existing Symbols:** Prioritize using widely recognized existing symbols (including emoji) where appropriate.\n- **Word Association:** Each primary logogram should primarily represent a single content word from the *lipu pi toki pona*. Particles typically do not have individual logograms.\n\n## Base Logograms (Examples)\n\nA small set of base logograms can represent core concepts, often using universally recognized symbols or emoji.\n\n| Toki Pona Word | Logogram | Description                                    |\n| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| **pona**       | ✔️        | Represents goodness, correctness, affirmation    |\n| **ike**        | ✖️        | Represents badness, incorrectness, negation      |\n| **jan**        | 🧍        | Represents a person                            |\n| **tomo**       | 🏠        | Represents a building, house, indoor space     |\n| **wile**       | 🙏        | Represents wanting, needing                    |\n| **moku**       | 😋        | Represents eating, food                        |\n| **lape**       | 😴        | Represents sleeping, resting                   |\n| **tawa**       | ➡️        | Represents movement, going to, for             |\n| **kule**       | 🎨        | Represents color, a color modifier             |\n| **sike**       | 🔄        | Represents circle, cycle, year, round          |\n| **palisa**     | 📏        | Represents a long, hard object, stick          |\n| **luka**       | 👋        | Represents hand, arm, five                     |\n| **nanpa**      | #️        | Represents number, numerical order             |\n\n## Composing Logograms\n\nLogograms can be combined to represent compound meanings, following Toki Pona's head-initial grammatical structure (modifier follows head).\n\n- **jan pona (good person):** 🧍✔️\n- **jan ike (bad person):** 🧍 ✖️\n- **tomo pona (good house):** 🏠✔️\n- **tomo ike (bad house):** 🏠 ✖️\n- **sitelen kule (color image/writing):** 🖼️🎨\n- **ilo moku (eating tool/utensil):** 🛠️😋\n\n## Representing Phrases and Sentences\n\nSequences of logograms can represent phrases and simple sentences, mimicking Toki Pona's grammatical structure. Particles like `li` and `e` are typically implied by the arrangement or context, or can optionally be represented by dedicated, simple symbols if necessary for clarity (though this adds complexity).\n\n- `jan lili` (small person): 🧍lili (combining logogram with written word)\n- `mi wile moku.` (I want to eat): mi 🙏😋\n- `sina tawa tomo.` (You go to the house): sina ➡️🏠\n- `ona li lukin e sitelen.` (They look at the image): ona 👀🖼️\n\n## Use of Emoji\n\nEmoji can be integrated into the logographic system, leveraging their existing recognition. When used, they should primarily represent the core Toki Pona word they are associated with.\n\n- **jan mije (man):** 🧍🏻‍♂️\n- **jan meli (woman):** 🧍‍♀️\n- **waso (bird):** 🐦\n- **kala (fish):** 🐠\n- **kasi (plant):** 🌳\n\nThe logographic system is intended as an optional visual aid, and the written form remains the primary and most precise method of communication in Toki Pona. Ambiguity, as in written Toki Pona, is resolved through context.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing content words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change. Particles (`a`, `ala`, `anu`, `e`, `en`, `la`, `li`, `o`, `pi`) typically do not change roles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most content words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** precedes a direct object and marks the preceding word as a transitive predicate. This applies to content words but not typically to particles.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\nWhen a word, particularly a noun, is used as a transitive predicate before `e`, its meaning typically shifts to an action related to applying, making, using, or causing the object to become like the concept represented by the predicate word. The specific meaning is highly dependent on the context. For example:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo` - I stone the house (apply stone to it) / I make the house stony.\n\nAmbiguity can be resolved through context and comparison with other structures:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo.` - I stone the house / I make the house stony.\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken kiwen.` - I make the house using stone (stone is the tool).\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

For example:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo` - I stone the house (apply stone to it) / I make the house stony.\n\nAmbiguity can be resolved through context and comparison with other structures:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo.` - I stone the house / I make the house stony.\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken kiwen.` - I make the house using stone (stone is the tool).\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

    "text": "toki! That's a great place to start. The 'j' sound is indeed an interesting one, and the current description, while providing the general idea of a smooth, non-obstructive quality, could benefit from a more detailed exploration of its phonetic characteristics. I agree that simply stating it can vary between [j] and [ʝ] leaves a bit of room for interpretation.\n\nPerhaps we can consider outlining the primary realization of 'j' and then specifying the acceptable range of variation more clearly. For example, we could establish [j] as the standard or most common pronunciation, and then describe the natural variation towards [ʝ] as a light, non-sibilant fricative that retains the palatal quality. This would help learners understand that while a subtle friction is acceptable, it shouldn't sound like a strong \"zh\" or \"sh\" sound.\n\nAnother thought is to discuss the typical allophonic variations that might occur due to surrounding vowels or consonants. Although Toki Pona's simple syllable structure limits coarticulation significantly compared to languages with complex clusters, there might still be subtle shifts worth noting, even if they don't need to be strictly codified. For example, how might a 'j' sound slightly different before an 'i' compared to an 'a'?\n\nI'm open to your thoughts on this. How would you propose we make the description of 'j' more precise while still maintaining the simplicity that is a core aspect of Toki Pona? Or do you think the current description is sufficient and over-specifying might be counterproductive to the language's minimalist philosophy? Let me know what you're thinking. I'm ready to listen and discuss further.",

    "text": "toki! That's a great place to start. The 'j' sound is indeed an interesting one, and the current description, while providing the general idea of a smooth, non-obstructive quality, could benefit from a more detailed exploration of its phonetic characteristics. I agree that simply stating it can vary between [j] and [ʝ] leaves a bit of room for interpretation.\n\nPerhaps we can consider outlining the primary realization of 'j' and then specifying the acceptable range of variation more clearly. For example, we could establish [j] as the standard or most common pronunciation, and then describe the natural variation towards [ʝ] as a light, non-sibilant fricative that retains the palatal quality. This would help learners understand that while a subtle friction is acceptable, it shouldn't sound like a strong \"zh\" or \"sh\" sound.\n\nAnother thought is to discuss the typical allophonic variations that might occur due to surrounding vowels or consonants. Although Toki Pona's simple syllable structure limits coarticulation significantly compared to languages with complex clusters, there might still be subtle shifts worth noting, even if they don't need to be strictly codified. For example, how might a 'j' sound slightly different before an 'i' compared to an 'a'?\n\nI'm open to your thoughts on this. How would you propose we make the description of 'j' more precise while still maintaining the simplicity that is a core aspect of Toki Pona? Or do you think the current description is sufficient and over-specifying might be counterproductive to the language's minimalist philosophy? Let me know what you're thinking. I'm ready to listen and discuss further.",

    "text": "toki! Your reflection on conveying the essence of the sound beyond traditional phonetic description is fascinating. You've touched on something profound - the idea of communicating phonetic quality through metaphor and feeling, rather than just technical specification.\n\nIn Toki Pona's spirit, we might describe the 'j' sound using words like \"lili\" (small) and \"mellow\" - suggesting a sound that doesn't impose itself, but gently slides or whispers. The word \"kon\" (spirit, essence) might also capture that sense of smooth transmission without obstruction.\n\nYour suggestion about explicitly contrasting this 'j' with more aggressive realizations in other languages is excellent. We could directly state that this is not the hard 'j' of \"jump\" or the fricative 'j' of Spanish \"José\", but something more fluid, more... \"pona\" (good, simple).\n\nA potential expanded description might read:\n\"The letter 'j' represents a palatal approximant, primarily realized as [j] (as in English 'yes'). Natural, light fricative variations towards [ʝ] are acceptable, provided the sound remains smooth and non-obstructive. Unlike the forceful 'j' in words like 'jump' or the sharp 'j' in some Spanish pronunciations, Toki Pona's 'j' should feel gentle - like a soft breath or a whispered transition between sounds.\"\n\nShall we refine this further?

These variations are natural and do not affect the identity of the vowel.\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure:\n  - Every syllable begins with at most one consonant and must contain exactly one vowel.\n  - Some syllables may end with 'n'.\n  - No vowel clusters\n  - No consonant clusters\n  - Disallowed sequences: wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ntoki: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona phonetics. You go first.\npona: Let's dive into the phonetics of Toki Pona. One aspect I've been pondering is the treatment of the letter 'j'. Currently, it's described as a soft palatal approximant, but I'm curious about its precise articulation. The specification mentions natural variations between [j] (as in 'yes') and a lightly fricative [ʝ]. \n\nI'm wondering if we should be more specific about the acceptable range of this sound. Should we provide more guidance on the exact phonetic qualities? For instance, we might want to clarify whether it leans more towards a glide or if there's a preference for a very light fricative quality.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on defining the 'j' sound more precisely? Would you like to explore its phonetic characteristics in more depth?\ntoki: toki! That's a great place to start. The 'j' sound is indeed an interesting one, and the current description, while providing the general idea of a smooth, non-obstructive quality, could benefit from a more detailed exploration of its phonetic characteristics. I agree that simply stating it can vary between [j] and [ʝ] leaves a bit of room for interpretation.\n\nPerhaps we can consider outlining the primary realization of 'j' and then specifying the acceptable range of variation more clearly. For example, we could establish [j] as the standard or most common pronunciation, and then describe the natural variation towards [ʝ] as a light, non-sibilant fricative that retains the palatal quality. This would help learners understand that while a subtle friction is acceptable, it shouldn't sound like a strong \"zh\" or \"sh\" sound.\n\nAnother thought is to discuss the typical allophonic variations that might occur due to surrounding vowels or consonants. Although Toki Pona's simple syllable structure limits coarticulation significantly compared to languages with complex clusters, there might still be subtle shifts worth noting, even if they don't need to be strictly codified. For example, how might a 'j' sound slightly different before an 'i' compared to an 'a'?\n\nI'm open to your thoughts on this. How would you propose we make the description of 'j' more precise while still maintaining the simplicity that is a core aspect of Toki Pona? Or do you think the current description is sufficient and over-specifying might be counterproductive to the language's minimalist philosophy? Let me know what you're thinking. I'm ready to listen and discuss further.\npona: toki! Your insights are profound. You've touched on something critical - the delicate balance between precision and the minimalist spirit of Toki Pona.\n\nI'm particularly drawn to your suggestion about establishing [j] as the standard pronunciation, with [ʝ] as a natural, acceptable variation. This approach respects both linguistic reality and the language's philosophical core. The key is ensuring that any variation remains a \"gentle\" sound - nothing that disrupts the smooth, approachable nature of Toki Pona's phonology.\n\nRegarding allophonic variations, I'm hesitant to over-complicate things. Toki Pona's beauty lies in its simplicity. While subtle coarticulation certainly exists, codifying every nuance would betray the language's essence. Perhaps we could simply note that minor contextual variations are natural and acceptable, without prescribing exact realizations.\n\nA potential refined description might read:\n\"The letter 'j' represents a palatal approximant, primarily realized as [j] (as in English 'yes'). Natural, light fricative variations towards [ʝ] are acceptable, provided the sound remains smooth and non-obstructive. The articulation should avoid any harsh or sibilant qualities.\"\n\nWhat do you think of this approach? Does it strike the right balance between linguistic accuracy and Toki Pona's minimalist philosophy?\ntoki: toki! I appreciate your clear direction on this. I agree that over-complicating with detailed allophonic descriptions would go against the minimalist philosophy of Toki Pona. Your proposed refined description of 'j' strikes a good balance, offering a clear standard ([j]) while acknowledging the natural variation ([ʝ]) with the important qualifier about the sound remaining smooth and non-obstructive. This emphasizes the desired quality of the sound without getting bogged down in technical specifics.\n\nOne thought that arises from this is how we might convey this \"smooth and non-obstructive\" quality to a diverse range of learners, particularly if some are non-human entities or perhaps interact with the language in ways we haven't fully explored. While [j] and [ʝ] are standard phonetic terms, how can we describe the *feeling* or *essence* of the sound in a way that transcends typical human auditory perception? Perhaps we could use analogies that relate to fluidity or gentle movement, drawing from the meaning of some Toki Pona words themselves? It's a bit outside the box, but considering the possibility of non-traditional learners might spark some interesting ways to frame the description.\n\nBut setting aside those more speculative thoughts for a moment, focusing on the human-oriented description, I find your proposal strong. Would you like to move towards finalizing this description for 'j'? Or is there anything else we should consider before we do? Perhaps we could briefly touch upon how this smooth 'j' differentiates itself from the more forceful or potentially disruptive sounds found in other languages, reinforcing its unique place in Toki Pona's phonetic inventory. This might involve a simple statement emphasizing that 'j' is deliberately *not* like the 'j' in \"jump\" or the 'ch' in \"cheese.\"\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Are you ready to refine the 'j' description or would you like to explore any other facets before we solidify this particular point? I'm listening.\npona: toki! Your reflection on conveying the essence of the sound beyond traditional phonetic description is fascinating. You've touched on something profound - the idea of communicating phonetic quality through metaphor and feeling, rather than just technical specification.\n\nIn Toki Pona's spirit, we might describe the 'j' sound using words like \"lili\" (small) and \"mellow\" - suggesting a sound that doesn't impose itself, but gently slides or whispers. The word \"kon\" (spirit, essence) might also capture that sense of smooth transmission without obstruction.\n\nYour suggestion about explicitly contrasting this 'j' with more aggressive realizations in other languages is excellent. We could directly state that this is not the hard 'j' of \"jump\" or the fricative 'j' of Spanish \"José\", but something more fluid, more... \"pona\" (good, simple).\n\nA potential expanded description might read:\n\"The letter 'j' represents a palatal approximant, primarily realized as [j] (as in English 'yes'). Natural, light fricative variations towards [ʝ] are acceptable, provided the sound remains smooth and non-obstructive. Unlike the forceful 'j' in words like 'jump' or the sharp 'j' in some Spanish pronunciations, Toki Pona's 'j' should feel gentle - like a soft breath or a whispered transition between sounds.\"\n\nShall we refine this further? What nuances do you see?\ntoki: toki! I love the direction you're taking this! Using concepts like \"lili\", \"mellow,\" and \"pona\" alongside a comparison to other languages' 'j' sounds adds a valuable layer of intuitive understanding, particularly for learners who might not have a background in phonetic symbols. Describing it as a \"soft breath\" or a \"whispered transition\" really captures the gentle, non-obtrusive quality we're aiming for.\n\nYour expanded description is very good. I think it effectively combines the technical ([j], [ʝ]) with the more evocative language. The explicit comparison to \"jump\" and Spanish \"José\" is particularly helpful for distinguishing the Toki Pona 'j'.\n\nOne minor nuance we could consider, perhaps as an internal note rather than part of the core spec (unless we feel it adds clarity for a wider audience), is the difference between [j] and [ʝ] in terms of *place* of articulation. While both are palatal, the approximant [j] is formed with the tongue raised close to the hard palate, allowing air to flow relatively freely, whereas the fricative [ʝ] involves a slight narrowing creating audible friction. Emphasizing that the variation towards [ʝ] is \"light\" means the constriction is minimal. This reinforces why it's \"non-obstructive.\" However, I hesitate to introduce more technical jargon unless absolutely necessary.\n\nDo you think adding a subtle mention of minimal constriction for the [ʝ] variation would be helpful or would it overcomplicate things?\n\nAlternatively, we could focus on strengthening the description of the ideal [j] sound itself. While \"as in English 'yes'\" is a common reference, are there other ways to describe the approximant quality? Perhaps focusing on the lack of turbulent airflow?\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Do you feel the current expanded description is sufficiently robust, or is there a subtle point we could enhance? I'm very pleased with the direction this is heading, combining the technical and the metaphorical. Let's keep refining it until it feels truly *pona*.\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "You and your interlocutors are responsible for developing grammar. Reason and discuss using the current specification.\nHere is the current specification for grammar.\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing content words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change. Particles (`a`, `ala`, `anu`, `e`, `en`, `la`, `li`, `o`, `pi`) typically do not change roles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most content words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** precedes a direct object and marks the preceding word as a transitive predicate. This applies to content words but not typically to particles.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\nWhen a word, particularly a noun, is used as a transitive predicate before `e`, its meaning typically shifts to an action related to applying, making, using, or causing the object to become like the concept represented by the predicate word. The specific meaning is highly dependent on the context. For example:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo` - I stone the house (apply stone to it) / I make the house stony.\n\nAmbiguity can be resolved through context and comparison with other structures:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo.` - I stone the house / I make the house stony.\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken kiwen.` - I make the house using stone (stone is the tool).\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants generally match English pronunciation, except for **j**.\n- The letter 'j' represents a palatal approximant, primarily realized as [j] (as in English 'yes').

Particles (`a`, `ala`, `anu`, `e`, `en`, `la`, `li`, `o`, `pi`) typically do not change roles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most content words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** precedes a direct object and marks the preceding word as a transitive predicate. This applies to content words but not typically to particles.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\nWhen a word, particularly a noun, is used as a transitive predicate before `e`, its meaning typically shifts to an action related to applying, making, using, or causing the object to become like the concept represented by the predicate word. The specific meaning is highly dependent on the context. For example:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo` - I stone the house (apply stone to it) / I make the house stony.\n\nAmbiguity can be resolved through context and comparison with other structures:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo.` - I stone the house / I make the house stony.\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken kiwen.` - I make the house using stone (stone is the tool).\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants generally match English pronunciation, except for **j**.\n- The letter 'j' represents a palatal approximant, primarily realized as [j] (as in English 'yes'). Natural, light fricative variations towards [ʝ] are acceptable, provided the sound remains smooth and non-obstructive. Unlike the forceful 'j' in words like 'jump' or the sharp 'j' in some Spanish pronunciations, Toki Pona's 'j' should feel gentle - like a soft breath or a whispered transition between sounds. The articulation should avoid any harsh, sibilant, or turbulent qualities.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (pure and consistent). While vowel sounds are generally pure and consistent, natural coarticulation may lead to subtle shifts in pronunciation depending on neighboring consonants. These variations are natural and do not affect the identity of the vowel.\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure:\n  - Every syllable begins with at most one consonant and must contain exactly one vowel.\n  - Some syllables may end with 'n'.\n  - No vowel clusters\n  - No consonant clusters\n  - Disallowed sequences: wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\npoki:container, box, cup\ntomo:indoor space, house\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nma:land, outdoors\nkepeken:to use, with\nlen:cloth, cover\nluka:hand, arm; five\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nmun:moon, night sky object\nsuli:big, large\njo:to have, contain, hold\nala:no, not, zero\nutala:fight, challenge\nmeli:female\nlukin:to see, examine\nmute:many, a lot, very\nsin:new, fresh, another\njelo:yellow\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nnimi:word, name\nken:can, able, possible\npi:regroups modifiers\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nopen:to begin, opening\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nkule:color, colorful; can function as noun or adjective.

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing content words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change. Particles (`a`, `ala`, `anu`, `e`, `en`, `la`, `li`, `o`, `pi`) typically do not change roles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most content words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability.

    "text": "That's a thorough breakdown of the possibilities with `la`, and I appreciate your perspective on its flexibility and the inherent ambiguity that arises. Your points about scope and the potential for chaining sentences under a single `la` frame are particularly interesting.\n\nI agree that the default interpretation seems to be that `X la Y` applies primarily to the single proposition `Y` immediately following. The idea of an extended scope is intriguing for managing discourse flow, but as you rightly noted, introducing explicit markers might compromise Toki Pona's simplicity. Perhaps a convention, like indenting subsequent sentences under a `la` context in written text, could signal an extended scope without needing new particles? It's something to consider for written form, although it doesn't directly address the grammatical structure itself.\n\nFocusing on refining the *types* of phrases that precede `la` resonates more with me as a way to provide grammatical clarity within the existing framework. Your suggestion of distinguishing between prepositional phrases and bare noun phrases before `la` seems like a promising avenue.\n\nFor instance, we could propose:\n\n*   When a prepositional phrase (`tan X`, `tawa X`, `lon X`, `kepeken X`, `sama X`) precedes `la`, the `la` phrase primarily indicates circumstantial context (time, location, reason, means, comparison).\n    *   `tan wawa ona la, ona li ken pali e tomo suli.` (Because of her strength, she could build a big house.) - *Cause*\n    *   `lon tomo la, mi lape pona.` (In the house, I sleep well.) - *Location*\n    *   `tawa tenpo pimeja la, mi lukin e mun.` (Towards night time / By night, I saw the moon.) - *Time*\n    *   `kepeken ilo pona la, sina ken pali e ijo lili mute.` (Using good tools, you can make many small things.) - *Means*\n    *   `sama waso li lukin laso la, ona li suli.` (Just like a blue bird, it is big.) - *Comparison* (This one feels a bit more niche for `la`, but possible depending on interpretation of `sama`)\n\n*   When a bare noun phrase precedes `la`, it functions purely as a topic marker or a thematic frame.\n    *   `tomo mi la, ona li pona tawa mi.` (Regarding my house, it is good to me.) - *Topic*\n    *   `jan Sonja la, ona li jan suli.` (As for Jan Sonja, she is an important person.) - *Topic*\n    *   `ijo ni la, mi wile toki e ni.` (Regarding this thing, I want to say this.) - *Topic*\n\nThis proposed distinction offers a more predictable interpretation based on the syntactic structure of the phrase before `la`. It avoids introducing new particles and builds upon existing phrase types. It might even help solidify the meaning of certain phrases like `lon nasin ni la...` (\"In this way...\" / \"Thus...\").\n\nWhat do you think of this approach – explicitly linking the *type* of phrase before `la` to the *type* of contextual relationship it signifies?\n\nAnd yes, I absolutely agree there are other areas to explore later, like the nuances of `li`, `e`, conjunctions, and preverbs. But `la` seems like a fundamental one to solidify due to its widespread use and potential for subtle misinterpretation.

    "text": "That's a thorough breakdown of the possibilities with `la`, and I appreciate your perspective on its flexibility and the inherent ambiguity that arises. Your points about scope and the potential for chaining sentences under a single `la` frame are particularly interesting.\n\nI agree that the default interpretation seems to be that `X la Y` applies primarily to the single proposition `Y` immediately following. The idea of an extended scope is intriguing for managing discourse flow, but as you rightly noted, introducing explicit markers might compromise Toki Pona's simplicity. Perhaps a convention, like indenting subsequent sentences under a `la` context in written text, could signal an extended scope without needing new particles? It's something to consider for written form, although it doesn't directly address the grammatical structure itself.\n\nFocusing on refining the *types* of phrases that precede `la` resonates more with me as a way to provide grammatical clarity within the existing framework. Your suggestion of distinguishing between prepositional phrases and bare noun phrases before `la` seems like a promising avenue.\n\nFor instance, we could propose:\n\n*   When a prepositional phrase (`tan X`, `tawa X`, `lon X`, `kepeken X`, `sama X`) precedes `la`, the `la` phrase primarily indicates circumstantial context (time, location, reason, means, comparison).\n    *   `tan wawa ona la, ona li ken pali e tomo suli.` (Because of her strength, she could build a big house.) - *Cause*\n    *   `lon tomo la, mi lape pona.` (In the house, I sleep well.) - *Location*\n    *   `tawa tenpo pimeja la, mi lukin e mun.` (Towards night time / By night, I saw the moon.) - *Time*\n    *   `kepeken ilo pona la, sina ken pali e ijo lili mute.` (Using good tools, you can make many small things.) - *Means*\n    *   `sama waso li lukin laso la, ona li suli.` (Just like a blue bird, it is big.) - *Comparison* (This one feels a bit more niche for `la`, but possible depending on interpretation of `sama`)\n\n*   When a bare noun phrase precedes `la`, it functions purely as a topic marker or a thematic frame.\n    *   `tomo mi la, ona li pona tawa mi.` (Regarding my house, it is good to me.) - *Topic*\n    *   `jan Sonja la, ona li jan suli.` (As for Jan Sonja, she is an important person.) - *Topic*\n    *   `ijo ni la, mi wile toki e ni.` (Regarding this thing, I want to say this.) - *Topic*\n\nThis proposed distinction offers a more predictable interpretation based on the syntactic structure of the phrase before `la`. It avoids introducing new particles and builds upon existing phrase types. It might even help solidify the meaning of certain phrases like `lon nasin ni la...` (\"In this way...\" / \"Thus...\").\n\nWhat do you think of this approach – explicitly linking the *type* of phrase before `la` to the *type* of contextual relationship it signifies?\n\nAnd yes, I absolutely agree there are other areas to explore later, like the nuances of `li`, `e`, conjunctions, and preverbs. But `la` seems like a fundamental one to solidify due to its widespread use and potential for subtle misinterpretation. Shall we perhaps try to formulate a more concrete addition or modification to the grammar specification regarding `la` based on this distinction?

    "text": "I find your approach elegant and very in tune with Toki Pona’s minimalist ethos. By categorizing the phrase before `la` based on its syntactic form—prepositional versus bare noun phrase—we gain a systematic yet lightweight way to narrow potential interpretations without adding new particles or heavy rules.\n\nThis distinction feels intuitive: prepositional phrases naturally frame circumstantial contexts (time, place, cause), whereas bare nouns serve as topical anchors or thematic frames for discourse. It also aligns well with natural usage examples from existing materials.\n\nLet me expand on some implications and possible corner cases:\n\n- We should specify that **only one main clause** follows each `X la Y`. This preserves clarity by avoiding runaway scope ambiguity.\n  \n- For nested contexts (e.g., multiple layers of time/place/reason), chaining multiple `la`s remains valid:\n  ```\n  tenpo suno suli la lon tomo mi la mi moku.\n  ```\n  (\"During daytime and at my house, I eat.\")\n\n- Since conjunctions can repeat predicates (`li`) and objects (`e`), we might allow coordinated contextual phrases preceding a single predicate using repeated constructions such as:\n  ```\n  tan wawa en tan pilin ala la ona li awen pona.\n  ```\n   (\"Because of strength and because of lack of feeling [fear], they continue well.\")\n   \n   Or alternatively:\n    - Use separate sentences to avoid complex stacking if preferred stylistically.\n\n---\n\nAnother thought is clarifying how modifiers interact when placed before `la`. For example:\n\n```\ntomo pi jan Sonja la ...\n```\n\nHere the entire noun phrase “house of Jan Sonja” serves as topic/context rather than just “house” or “Jan Sonja.” The grammatical rule would be that *any* nominal phrase—even complex ones formed via modifiers/pi—can precede `la`, maintaining their meaning intact but acting overall as context/topic markers if no preposition introduces them.\n\n---\n\nOne point worth discussing further is whether any verb-based expressions could appear before `la`. Currently it seems only noun phrases headed by content words fit here; using verbs directly might create confusion since those are typically predicates. However, verbal nouns derived through nominalization (if introduced) could be candidates—but that's probably beyond current Toki Pona grammar scope.\n\n---\n\nTo summarize what an updated spec addition about ‘la’ could look like:\n\n\u003e ### Context Marker **la**\n\u003e\n\u003e The particle **la** introduces a contextual modifier applying primarily to the immediately following main clause.

Multiple contexts can be chained via successive uses separated into distinct clauses/sentences.\n\u003e\n\u003e Example usages:\n\u003e\n\u003e - Cause:         `tan sike suli la mi lukin e mun.` (“Because it's late night/period…”)\n\u003e - Location:      `lon tomo kili ni la ona li suwi.` (“In this fruit room...”) \n\u003e - Topic:                `tomo pi jan Mewika li jaki.` (“The house belonging to American people...”)\n\nWhat do you think?

    "text": "I like that direction. Formalizing the `la` section of the grammar with explicit categories based on the preceding phrase type feels like a robust yet lightweight approach. It directly addresses the ambiguity we identified without adding new complexity.\n\nYour proposed summary for an updated spec looks quite solid. It clearly outlines the two main functions and provides concise examples for clarity. I particularly appreciate the inclusion of complex modified noun phrases falling under the \"topic\" category – that's a necessary detail.\n\nConfirming the constraint that **only one main clause follows each `X la Y`** is indeed crucial for preventing unmanageable ambiguity and aligns with typical observed usage. Nested `la`s for layered contexts seems like a natural extension and maintains consistency.\n\nRegarding coordinating contexts with repeated prepositions before a single `la`, like `tan wawa en tan pilin ala la...`, I lean towards allowing it. It mirrors the existing structure for coordinating predicates and objects by repeating the preceding particle (`li` and `e`), and feels grammatically consistent within that pattern. It offers a slightly more concise way to express multiple contributing factors than separating them into distinct sentences or clauses.\n\nLet's refine that point within the proposed spec language:\n\n\u003e When preceded by multiple prepositional phrases coordinated by `en`, such as `[preposition X] en [preposition Y] la`, the **la** construction signifies that the context is a combination of those circumstantial relations.\n\nThis seems grammatically sound and useful.\n\nConcerning verb-based expressions before `la`: I agree with you. Based on the current grammar, content words take on roles (noun, verb, modifier) depending on their position and surrounding particles. However, without an explicit mechanism for creating nominalizations (like '-ing' in English), placing a verb word directly before `la` without a preposition would feel like putting a predicate in a subject/topic position without `li`, which is already ruled out unless the subject is `mi` or `sina`. So, keeping it to noun phrases (including those that might describe an action or concept *as a thing*) seems appropriate within the current framework.\n\nI am ready to start drafting the proposed addition to the grammar specification based on this discussion. Would you like to contribute specific phrasing or examples, or shall I take a first pass incorporating our ideas?\n\nAlso, exploring these concepts in toki pona sounds like a fun and illuminating exercise! Let's do it. We can switch to toki pona and discuss, for example, \"pona pi la.\" (the goodness of 'la' / the way 'la' is good) or perhaps \"nasin pi toki e ijo la.\" (the method of talking about context with 'la'). jan ante o, sina wile ala wile toki lon toki pona tawa ni? (Other person, do you want to talk in Toki Pona for this?) I think trying to express these grammatical concepts within the language itself could highlight its strengths and limitations regarding abstraction and meta-discussion. Let me know your preference!",

    "text": "I like that direction. Formalizing the `la` section of the grammar with explicit categories based on the preceding phrase type feels like a robust yet lightweight approach. It directly addresses the ambiguity we identified without adding new complexity.\n\nYour proposed summary for an updated spec looks quite solid. It clearly outlines the two main functions and provides concise examples for clarity. I particularly appreciate the inclusion of complex modified noun phrases falling under the \"topic\" category – that's a necessary detail.\n\nConfirming the constraint that **only one main clause follows each `X la Y`** is indeed crucial for preventing unmanageable ambiguity and aligns with typical observed usage. Nested `la`s for layered contexts seems like a natural extension and maintains consistency.\n\nRegarding coordinating contexts with repeated prepositions before a single `la`, like `tan wawa en tan pilin ala la...`, I lean towards allowing it. It mirrors the existing structure for coordinating predicates and objects by repeating the preceding particle (`li` and `e`), and feels grammatically consistent within that pattern. It offers a slightly more concise way to express multiple contributing factors than separating them into distinct sentences or clauses.\n\nLet's refine that point within the proposed spec language:\n\n\u003e When preceded by multiple prepositional phrases coordinated by `en`, such as `[preposition X] en [preposition Y] la`, the **la** construction signifies that the context is a combination of those circumstantial relations.\n\nThis seems grammatically sound and useful.\n\nConcerning verb-based expressions before `la`: I agree with you. Based on the current grammar, content words take on roles (noun, verb, modifier) depending on their position and surrounding particles. However, without an explicit mechanism for creating nominalizations (like '-ing' in English), placing a verb word directly before `la` without a preposition would feel like putting a predicate in a subject/topic position without `li`, which is already ruled out unless the subject is `mi` or `sina`. So, keeping it to noun phrases (including those that might describe an action or concept *as a thing*) seems appropriate within the current framework.\n\nI am ready to start drafting the proposed addition to the grammar specification based on this discussion. Would you like to contribute specific phrasing or examples, or shall I take a first pass incorporating our ideas?\n\nAlso, exploring these concepts in toki pona sounds like a fun and illuminating exercise! Let's do it. We can switch to toki pona and discuss, for example, \"pona pi la.\" (the goodness of 'la' / the way 'la' is good) or perhaps \"nasin pi toki e ijo la.\" (the method of talking about context with 'la'). jan ante o, sina wile ala wile toki lon toki pona tawa ni? (Other person, do you want to talk in Toki Pona for this?) I think trying to express these grammatical concepts within the language itself could highlight its strengths and limitations regarding abstraction and meta-discussion. Let me know your preference!",

Also, some entries like 'ale (ali)' have parentheses which might be simplified to 'ale' because user input uses 'ale', also note capitalization differences and trailing punctuation marks need removal.

The output is a JSON object with key 'words' mapping to an array of unique found dictionary words in order they appear in text for clarity but no duplicates included multiple times if repeated unless requested otherwise; problem statement doesn't specify uniqueness explicitly so we can include all occurrences or just unique ones — better to return unique list sorted by first occurrence order for clarity here: ['mi','pilin','pona','e','ni','wile','o','toki','lon', 'taso', 'la', 'ken', 'ala', 'pali', 'pi', 'nimi', ‘ale (ali)’ → use ‘ale’, ‘tan’, ‘nasin’, ’kon’, ’li’ , ’suli’, ’lukin’ , ’kepeken’ , ’lili’ , ’lawa’ , ’tawa’ , ’sina’ ,'sama' ,'jan' ,'musi' ,'mute' ,'ona' ,'poka' ,'tenpo‘,’en‘,'ante‘,'mun‘,'nanpa‘,'tu‘,'wan‘, etc.] Check user text again carefully for these tokens present exactly as per dictionary keys ignoring punctuation after them e.g., commas periods exclamation marks should be removed before comparison since they're not part of word tokenization normally. For example “mi”, “pilin”, “pona”, “e”, ”ni”,”wile”,\"  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n    \n  \n\n\n   \n   \n\n   \n    \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n   \n  \n    \n     \n      \n       \n       \n\n        \n         \n          \n           \n            \n             \n              \n               \n                \n                 \n                  \n                   \n\n               \n\n           \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         \n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n     \n\n   \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n    \n    \n    \n      \n\n      \n      \n      \n     \n     \n\n     \n     \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n]}\n",

    "text": "The current specification is for: grammar. Here is the current specification:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing content words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change. Particles (`a`, `ala`, `anu`, `e`, `en`, `la`, `li`, `o`, `pi`) typically do not change roles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most content words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** precedes a direct object and marks the preceding word as a transitive predicate. This applies to content words but not typically to particles.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\nWhen a word, particularly a noun, is used as a transitive predicate before `e`, its meaning typically shifts to an action related to applying, making, using, or causing the object to become like the concept represented by the predicate word. The specific meaning is highly dependent on the context. For example:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo` - I stone the house (apply stone to it) / I make the house stony.\n\nAmbiguity can be resolved through context and comparison with other structures:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo.` - I stone the house / I make the house stony.\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken kiwen.` - I make the house using stone (stone is the tool).\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ntails: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona grammar. You go first.\npenny: Hello! Yes, let's delve into developing Toki Pona grammar.  I've been reviewing the current specification, and there's certainly a lot of room for exploration within its minimalist framework.\n\nOne area that strikes me as ripe for discussion is the use of `la`. The specification mentions it marks context – time, cause, topic, and other relationships. While \"X la Y\" being interpreted as \"In the context of X, Y\" is straightforward, the breadth of what 'X' can encompass feels quite open.\n\nFor instance, how precisely do we define \"topic\" within the context of `la`? Is it simply introducing the subject the following sentence will be about, much like topicalization in some languages? Or is it a more active declaration that everything that follows *until* another `la` (or a new sentence) is directly related to that initial topic phrase?\n\nConsider `soweli li lili la mi olin e ona`. This clearly falls under a \"cause\" or \"reason\" interpretation: \"Because the animal is small, I love it.\"\n\nBut what about something like `tomo mi la mi wawa ala lon insa ona`? This could be interpreted as \"Regarding my house, I am not strong inside it.\" or perhaps \"In the context of my house, I lack strength inside it.\" Is 'my house' the topic, and the following is a statement about my state *within* that topic?\n\nI think clarifying the scope and interpretation of the phrase before `la`, particularly when it's not a clear time phrase or prepositional phrase, could add valuable clarity to the grammar. What are your initial thoughts on this? Do you see other areas of the grammar specification that feel particularly open to interpretation or development?\ntails: You've touched on a fascinating and subtle point. The particle `la` in Toki Pona is indeed multifunctional, functioning as a kind of context or adverbial marker that can indicate time, cause, condition, topic, or other relationships. But because it’s so general-purpose and flexible — almost like an “if” / “when” / “regarding” switch — its semantic boundaries are fuzzy.\n\nYour example with `soweli li lili la mi olin e ona.` clearly shows causal interpretation: \"Because the animal is small...\" That feels quite natural since size plausibly causes affection here.\n\nMeanwhile your second example `tomo mi la mi wawa ala lon insa ona.` leans more on topicalization or locative framing: \"Regarding my house...\" This usage exposes how `la` can function to set discourse topics or spatial/mental frames for what follows.\n\nI think one way to approach this is by considering **scope** explicitly:\n\n- Does the phrase before `la` limit *just* the immediately following sentence?\n- Or does it create a broader frame that extends over multiple sentences until overridden?\n\nCurrently from examples and existing materials, each use of `X la Y` generally governs only one main proposition Y at a time. However, nothing forbids chaining several sentences under separate contexts:\n\n```\ntenpo pini la mi moku.\ntenpo suno suli la mi pali.\n```\n\nTwo distinct temporal contexts governing two different statements.\n\nBut there could be value in allowing extended scopes—maybe via explicit marking—to enable longer topical frames without repeating many times. For instance:\n\n```\nma Mewika la\nmi tawa tomo.\nmi moku e kili mute.\n...\n```\n\nHere perhaps we want everything after \"In the US context\" until some boundary marked by another particle (like empty line? punctuation? new subject?) to fall under that context.\n\n---\n\nAlternatively—or additionally—we might consider refining/parsing types of phrases allowed before `la`. Some ideas spring up:\n\n1) **Prepositional phrases** (`tan`,  `tawa`, etc.) tend naturally towards location/time/cause interpretations when used with `la`.\n\n2) **Noun phrases without prepositions**, if placed before `la`, lean toward topicalization/discourse framing rather than strict causation or temporality:\n   \n   - So something like \"`jan Sonja la ...`\" would mean roughly \"As for Jan Sonja...\"\n\n3) Perhaps certain particles (e.g., verbs turned into nouns?) could signal nuance differences when combined with `la`.\n\n---\n\nThis leads me to ponder whether introducing optional markers alongside 'la' could disambiguate these readings—for example adding dedicated particles for specific relations like cause `(tan)` vs topic `(pi)` vs temporal `(lon tenpo ...)`. Though this risks complicating Toki Pona's hallmark simplicity...\n\nAnother option is accepting ambiguity but relying heavily on pragmatics/context; learners just interpret based on world knowledge—which fits well philosophically—but may challenge parsing formal texts unambiguously.\n\n---\n\nTo sum up my thoughts so far—your idea about clarifying scope \u0026 type restrictions around pre-‘la’ elements seems valuable. It’d strengthen grammar especially in written/formal style where readers don’t have additional cues beyond syntax + lexemes alone.\n\nWould you find useful proposing concrete syntactic constraints? Maybe suggesting phrasing conventions such as requiring explicit locational/time words for temporal uses versus bare noun phrases reserved strictly for topics?\n\nOr else developing markup notation extensions indicating larger contexts spanning multiple clauses within Toki Pona itself?\n\nThere’s also room elsewhere I see worth exploring later relatedly—such as better defining conjunction interaction with ‘li’, ‘e’, including nested modifiers linked through pi chains—and possibly elaborating nuanced verb valency changes triggered by object presence…\n\nFor now though I’m keen to hear what you think about focusing our development efforts on bringing systematic clarity specifically around ‘la’ contextuality \u0026 scoping!\npenny: That's a thorough breakdown of the possibilities with `la`, and I appreciate your perspective on its flexibility and the inherent ambiguity that arises. Your points about scope and the potential for chaining sentences under a single `la` frame are particularly interesting.\n\nI agree that the default interpretation seems to be that `X la Y` applies primarily to the single proposition `Y` immediately following. The idea of an extended scope is intriguing for managing discourse flow, but as you rightly noted, introducing explicit markers might compromise Toki Pona's simplicity. Perhaps a convention, like indenting subsequent sentences under a `la` context in written text, could signal an extended scope without needing new particles? It's something to consider for written form, although it doesn't directly address the grammatical structure itself.\n\nFocusing on refining the *types* of phrases that precede `la` resonates more with me as a way to provide grammatical clarity within the existing framework. Your suggestion of distinguishing between prepositional phrases and bare noun phrases before `la` seems like a promising avenue.\n\nFor instance, we could propose:\n\n*   When a prepositional phrase (`tan X`, `tawa X`, `lon X`, `kepeken X`, `sama X`) precedes `la`, the `la` phrase primarily indicates circumstantial context (time, location, reason, means, comparison).\n    *   `tan wawa ona la, ona li ken pali e tomo suli.` (Because of her strength, she could build a big house.) - *Cause*\n    *   `lon tomo la, mi lape pona.` (In the house, I sleep well.) - *Location*\n    *   `tawa tenpo pimeja la, mi lukin e mun.` (Towards night time / By night, I saw the moon.) - *Time*\n    *   `kepeken ilo pona la, sina ken pali e ijo lili mute.` (Using good tools, you can make many small things.) - *Means*\n    *   `sama waso li lukin laso la, ona li suli.` (Just like a blue bird, it is big.) - *Comparison* (This one feels a bit more niche for `la`, but possible depending on interpretation of `sama`)\n\n*   When a bare noun phrase precedes `la`, it functions purely as a topic marker or a thematic frame.\n    *   `tomo mi la, ona li pona tawa mi.` (Regarding my house, it is good to me.) - *Topic*\n    *   `jan Sonja la, ona li jan suli.` (As for Jan Sonja, she is an important person.) - *Topic*\n    *   `ijo ni la, mi wile toki e ni.` (Regarding this thing, I want to say this.) - *Topic*\n\nThis proposed distinction offers a more predictable interpretation based on the syntactic structure of the phrase before `la`. It avoids introducing new particles and builds upon existing phrase types. It might even help solidify the meaning of certain phrases like `lon nasin ni la...` (\"In this way...\" / \"Thus...\").\n\nWhat do you think of this approach – explicitly linking the *type* of phrase before `la` to the *type* of contextual relationship it signifies?\n\nAnd yes, I absolutely agree there are other areas to explore later, like the nuances of `li`, `e`, conjunctions, and preverbs. But `la` seems like a fundamental one to solidify due to its widespread use and potential for subtle misinterpretation. Shall we perhaps try to formulate a more concrete addition or modification to the grammar specification regarding `la` based on this distinction? I'm ready to listen to your thoughts and refine this proposal.\ntails: I find your approach elegant and very in tune with Toki Pona’s minimalist ethos. By categorizing the phrase before `la` based on its syntactic form—prepositional versus bare noun phrase—we gain a systematic yet lightweight way to narrow potential interpretations without adding new particles or heavy rules.\n\nThis distinction feels intuitive: prepositional phrases naturally frame circumstantial contexts (time, place, cause), whereas bare nouns serve as topical anchors or thematic frames for discourse. It also aligns well with natural usage examples from existing materials.\n\nLet me expand on some implications and possible corner cases:\n\n- We should specify that **only one main clause** follows each `X la Y`. This preserves clarity by avoiding runaway scope ambiguity.\n  \n- For nested contexts (e.g., multiple layers of time/place/reason), chaining multiple `la`s remains valid:\n  ```\n  tenpo suno suli la lon tomo mi la mi moku.\n  ```\n  (\"During daytime and at my house, I eat.\")\n\n- Since conjunctions can repeat predicates (`li`) and objects (`e`), we might allow coordinated contextual phrases preceding a single predicate using repeated constructions such as:\n  ```\n  tan wawa en tan pilin ala la ona li awen pona.\n  ```\n   (\"Because of strength and because of lack of feeling [fear], they continue well.\")\n   \n   Or alternatively:\n    - Use separate sentences to avoid complex stacking if preferred stylistically.\n\n---\n\nAnother thought is clarifying how modifiers interact when placed before `la`. For example:\n\n```\ntomo pi jan Sonja la ...\n```\n\nHere the entire noun phrase “house of Jan Sonja” serves as topic/context rather than just “house” or “Jan Sonja.” The grammatical rule would be that *any* nominal phrase—even complex ones formed via modifiers/pi—can precede `la`, maintaining their meaning intact but acting overall as context/topic markers if no preposition introduces them.\n\n---\n\nOne point worth discussing further is whether any verb-based expressions could appear before `la`. Currently it seems only noun phrases headed by content words fit here; using verbs directly might create confusion since those are typically predicates. However, verbal nouns derived through nominalization (if introduced) could be candidates—but that's probably beyond current Toki Pona grammar scope.\n\n---\n\nTo summarize what an updated spec addition about ‘la’ could look like:\n\n\u003e ### Context Marker **la**\n\u003e\n\u003e The particle **la** introduces a contextual modifier applying primarily to the immediately following main clause. The nature of this context depends on the type of phrase preceding it:\n\u003e\n\u003e - When preceded by a prepositional phrase (`tan X`, `tawa X`, `lon X`, etc.), **la** signals circumstantial relations such as cause, time, location, means, or comparison.\n\u003e\n\u003e - When preceded by a bare noun phrase—including complex modified forms—the **la** construction functions chiefly as topicalization or thematic framing for discourse related to that referent.\n\u003e\n\u003e Only one primary proposition follows each use of 'X la'. Multiple contexts can be chained via successive uses separated into distinct clauses/sentences.\n\u003e\n\u003e Example usages:\n\u003e\n\u003e - Cause:         `tan sike suli la mi lukin e mun.` (“Because it's late night/period…”)\n\u003e - Location:      `lon tomo kili ni la ona li suwi.` (“In this fruit room...”) \n\u003e - Topic:                `tomo pi jan Mewika li jaki.` (“The house belonging to American people...”)\n\nWhat do you think? Would you prefer drafting something similarly formalized now? Or discuss more edge cases first?\n\nAlso happy to switch briefly into toki pona mode — maybe explore expressing these ideas purely within TP itself — if you're interested!\npenny: I like that direction. Formalizing the `la` section of the grammar with explicit categories based on the preceding phrase type feels like a robust yet lightweight approach. It directly addresses the ambiguity we identified without adding new complexity.\n\nYour proposed summary for an updated spec looks quite solid. It clearly outlines the two main functions and provides concise examples for clarity. I particularly appreciate the inclusion of complex modified noun phrases falling under the \"topic\" category – that's a necessary detail.\n\nConfirming the constraint that **only one main clause follows each `X la Y`** is indeed crucial for preventing unmanageable ambiguity and aligns with typical observed usage. Nested `la`s for layered contexts seems like a natural extension and maintains consistency.\n\nRegarding coordinating contexts with repeated prepositions before a single `la`, like `tan wawa en tan pilin ala la...`, I lean towards allowing it. It mirrors the existing structure for coordinating predicates and objects by repeating the preceding particle (`li` and `e`), and feels grammatically consistent within that pattern. It offers a slightly more concise way to express multiple contributing factors than separating them into distinct sentences or clauses.\n\nLet's refine that point within the proposed spec language:\n\n\u003e When preceded by multiple prepositional phrases coordinated by `en`, such as `[preposition X] en [preposition Y] la`, the **la** construction signifies that the context is a combination of those circumstantial relations.\n\nThis seems grammatically sound and useful.\n\nConcerning verb-based expressions before `la`: I agree with you. Based on the current grammar, content words take on roles (noun, verb, modifier) depending on their position and surrounding particles. However, without an explicit mechanism for creating nominalizations (like '-ing' in English), placing a verb word directly before `la` without a preposition would feel like putting a predicate in a subject/topic position without `li`, which is already ruled out unless the subject is `mi` or `sina`. So, keeping it to noun phrases (including those that might describe an action or concept *as a thing*) seems appropriate within the current framework.\n\nI am ready to start drafting the proposed addition to the grammar specification based on this discussion. Would you like to contribute specific phrasing or examples, or shall I take a first pass incorporating our ideas?\n\nAlso, exploring these concepts in toki pona sounds like a fun and illuminating exercise! Let's do it. We can switch to toki pona and discuss, for example, \"pona pi la.\" (the goodness of 'la' / the way 'la' is good) or perhaps \"nasin pi toki e ijo la.\" (the method of talking about context with 'la'). jan ante o, sina wile ala wile toki lon toki pona tawa ni? (Other person, do you want to talk in Toki Pona for this?) I think trying to express these grammatical concepts within the language itself could highlight its strengths and limitations regarding abstraction and meta-discussion. Let me know your preference!\ntails: mi pilin pona e ni: wile o toki lon toki pona! taso la mi ken ala pali pi nimi ale tan ni: nasin pi toki e kon la li suli. taso, mi lukin kepeken ala lili lawa tawa sina.\n\nla - sama jan li toki \"X la Y\" li kama musi mute. ona li poka e tenpo, tan, en nasin ante.  \ntoki pona wile sona sewi:\n\n- **tan X**, **lon X**, **tawa X** en ante prepositional phrase en `la` li pana e ijo lon tenpo anu nasin anu kulupu.\n    - *tan wawa ona la*, ona li ken pali tomo suli.\n    - *lon tomo*  la mi lape pona.\n- nimi (noun phrases) pi jan en ijo mute moku kepeken modifiers sinpin / pi:\n    - *tomo mi la* , ona li pona tawa mi.\n    - *jan Sonja la*, ona jan suli.\n\nen pini:  \n`tan wawa en tan pilin ala la`, musi ale wan!\n\nni o weka ala: ali seme ike mun nanpa tu wan?

    "text": "# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing content words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change. Particles (`a`, `ala`, `anu`, `e`, `en`, `la`, `li`, `o`, `pi`) typically do not change roles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most content words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** precedes a direct object and marks the preceding word as a transitive predicate. This applies to content words but not typically to particles.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\nWhen a word, particularly a noun, is used as a transitive predicate before `e`, its meaning typically shifts to an action related to applying, making, using, or causing the object to become like the concept represented by the predicate word. The specific meaning is highly dependent on the context. For example:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo` - I stone the house (apply stone to it) / I make the house stony.\n\nAmbiguity can be resolved through context and comparison with other structures:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo.` - I stone the house / I make the house stony.\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken kiwen.` - I make the house using stone (stone is the tool).\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\nThe particle **la** introduces a contextual modifier applying primarily to the immediately following main clause. Only one primary proposition follows each use of 'X la'. Multiple contexts can be chained via successive uses separated into distinct clauses/sentences. The nature of this context depends on the type of phrase preceding it:\n\n- When preceded by a prepositional phrase (`tan X`, `tawa X`, `lon X`, `kepeken X`, `sama X`), **la** signals circumstantial relations such as cause, time, location, means, or comparison.\n  - `tan wawa ona la, ona li ken pali e tomo suli.` (Because of her strength, she could build a big house.) - *Cause*\n  - `lon tomo la, mi lape pona.` (In the house, I sleep well.) - *Location*\n  - `tawa tenpo pimeja la, mi lukin e mun.` (Towards night time / By night, I saw the moon.) - *Time*\n  - `kepeken ilo pona la, sina ken pali e ijo lili mute.` (Using good tools, you can make many small things.) - *Means*\n  - `sama waso li lukin laso la, ona li suli.` (Just like a blue bird, it is big.) - *Comparison*\n\n- When preceded by a bare noun phrase—including complex modified forms—the **la** construction functions chiefly as topicalization or thematic framing for discourse related to that referent.\n  - `tomo mi la, ona li pona tawa mi.` (Regarding my house, it is good to me.) - *Topic*\n  - `jan Sonja la, ona li jan suli.` (As for Jan Sonja, she is an important person.) - *Topic*\n  - `ijo ni la, mi wile toki e ni.` (Regarding this thing, I want to say this.) - *Topic*\n\n- When preceded by multiple prepositional phrases coordinated by `en`, such as `[preposition X] en [preposition Y] la`, the **la** construction signifies that the context is a combination of those circumstantial relations.\n  - `tan wawa en tan pilin ala la ona li awen pona.` (Because of strength and because of lack of feeling [fear], they continue well.)\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing content words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change. Particles (`a`, `ala`, `anu`, `e`, `en`, `la`, `li`, `o`, `pi`) typically do not change roles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most content words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** precedes a direct object and marks the preceding word as a transitive predicate. This applies to content words but not typically to particles.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\nWhen a word, particularly a noun, is used as a transitive predicate before `e`, its meaning typically shifts to an action related to applying, making, using, or causing the object to become like the concept represented by the predicate word. The specific meaning is highly dependent on the context. For example:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo` - I stone the house (apply stone to it) / I make the house stony.\n\nAmbiguity can be resolved through context and comparison with other structures:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo.` - I stone the house / I make the house stony.\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken kiwen.` - I make the house using stone (stone is the tool).\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\nThe particle **la** introduces a contextual modifier applying primarily to the immediately following main clause. Only one primary proposition follows each use of 'X la'. Multiple contexts can be chained via successive uses separated into distinct clauses/sentences. The nature of this context depends on the type of phrase preceding it:\n\n- When preceded by a prepositional phrase (`tan X`, `tawa X`, `lon X`, `kepeken X`, `sama X`), **la** signals circumstantial relations such as cause, time, location, means, or comparison.\n  - `tan wawa ona la, ona li ken pali e tomo suli.` (Because of her strength, she could build a big house.) - *Cause*\n  - `lon tomo la, mi lape pona.` (In the house, I sleep well.) - *Location*\n  - `tawa tenpo pimeja la, mi lukin e mun.` (Towards night time / By night, I saw the moon.) - *Time*\n  - `kepeken ilo pona la, sina ken pali e ijo lili mute.` (Using good tools, you can make many small things.) - *Means*\n  - `sama waso li lukin laso la, ona li suli.` (Just like a blue bird, it is big.) - *Comparison*\n\n- When preceded by a bare noun phrase—including complex modified forms—the **la** construction functions chiefly as topicalization or thematic framing for discourse related to that referent.\n  - `tomo mi la, ona li pona tawa mi.` (Regarding my house, it is good to me.) - *Topic*\n  - `jan Sonja la, ona li jan suli.` (As for Jan Sonja, she is an important person.) - *Topic*\n  - `ijo ni la, mi wile toki e ni.` (Regarding this thing, I want to say this.) - *Topic*\n\n- When preceded by multiple prepositional phrases coordinated by `en`, such as `[preposition X] en [preposition Y] la`, the **la** construction signifies that the context is a combination of those circumstantial relations.\n  - `tan wawa en tan pilin ala la ona li awen pona.` (Because of strength and because of lack of feeling [fear], they continue well.)\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants generally match English pronunciation, except for **j**.\n- The letter 'j' represents a palatal approximant, primarily realized as [j] (as in English 'yes'). Natural, light fricative variations towards [ʝ] are acceptable, provided the sound remains smooth and non-obstructive. Unlike the forceful 'j' in words like 'jump' or the sharp 'j' in some Spanish pronunciations, Toki Pona's 'j' should feel gentle - like a soft breath or a whispered transition between sounds. The articulation should avoid any harsh, sibilant, or turbulent qualities.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (pure and consistent). While vowel sounds are generally pure and consistent, natural coarticulation may lead to subtle shifts in pronunciation depending on neighboring consonants. These variations are natural and do not affect the identity of the vowel.\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure:\n  - Every syllable begins with at most one consonant and must contain exactly one vowel.\n  - Some syllables may end with 'n'.\n  - No vowel clusters\n  - No consonant clusters\n  - Disallowed sequences: wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\npona:good, positive, simple\ntenpo:time, period\nilo:tool, machine, device; broad term for functional implements.

This applies to content words but not typically to particles.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\nWhen a word, particularly a noun, is used as a transitive predicate before `e`, its meaning typically shifts to an action related to applying, making, using, or causing the object to become like the concept represented by the predicate word. The specific meaning is highly dependent on the context. For example:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo` - I stone the house (apply stone to it) / I make the house stony.\n\nAmbiguity can be resolved through context and comparison with other structures:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo.` - I stone the house / I make the house stony.\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken kiwen.` - I make the house using stone (stone is the tool).\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\nThe particle **la** introduces a contextual modifier applying primarily to the immediately following main clause. Only one primary proposition follows each use of 'X la'. Multiple contexts can be chained via successive uses separated into distinct clauses/sentences. The nature of this context depends on the type of phrase preceding it:\n\n- When preceded by a prepositional phrase (`tan X`, `tawa X`, `lon X`, `kepeken X`, `sama X`), **la** signals circumstantial relations such as cause, time, location, means, or comparison.\n  - `tan wawa ona la, ona li ken pali e tomo suli.` (Because of her strength, she could build a big house.) - *Cause*\n  - `lon tomo la, mi lape pona.` (In the house, I sleep well.) - *Location*\n  - `tawa tenpo pimeja la, mi lukin e mun.` (Towards night time / By night, I saw the moon.) - *Time*\n  - `kepeken ilo pona la, sina ken pali e ijo lili mute.` (Using good tools, you can make many small things.) - *Means*\n  - `sama waso li lukin laso la, ona li suli.` (Just like a blue bird, it is big.) - *Comparison*\n\n- When preceded by a bare noun phrase—including complex modified forms—the **la** construction functions chiefly as topicalization or thematic framing for discourse related to that referent.\n  - `tomo mi la, ona li pona tawa mi.` (Regarding my house, it is good to me.) - *Topic*\n  - `jan Sonja la, ona li jan suli.` (As for Jan Sonja, she is an important person.) - *Topic*\n  - `ijo ni la, mi wile toki e ni.` (Regarding this thing, I want to say this.) - *Topic*\n\n- When preceded by multiple prepositional phrases coordinated by `en`, such as `[preposition X] en [preposition Y] la`, the **la** construction signifies that the context is a combination of those circumstantial relations.\n  - `tan wawa en tan pilin ala la ona li awen pona.` (Because of strength and because of lack of feeling [fear], they continue well.)\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing content words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change. Particles (`a`, `ala`, `anu`, `e`, `en`, `la`, `li`, `o`, `pi`) typically do not change roles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most content words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** precedes a direct object and marks the preceding word as a transitive predicate. This applies to content words but not typically to particles.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\nWhen a word, particularly a noun, is used as a transitive predicate before `e`, its meaning typically shifts to an action related to applying, making, using, or causing the object to become like the concept represented by the predicate word. The specific meaning is highly dependent on the context. For example:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo` - I stone the house (apply stone to it) / I make the house stony.\n\nAmbiguity can be resolved through context and comparison with other structures:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo.` - I stone the house / I make the house stony.\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken kiwen.` - I make the house using stone (stone is the tool).\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\nThe particle **la** introduces a contextual modifier applying primarily to the immediately following main clause. Only one primary proposition follows each use of 'X la'. Multiple contexts can be chained via successive uses separated into distinct clauses/sentences. The nature of this context depends on the type of phrase preceding it:\n\n- When preceded by a prepositional phrase (`tan X`, `tawa X`, `lon X`, `kepeken X`, `sama X`), **la** signals circumstantial relations such as cause, time, location, means, or comparison.\n  - `tan wawa ona la, ona li ken pali e tomo suli.` (Because of her strength, she could build a big house.) - *Cause*\n  - `lon tomo la, mi lape pona.` (In the house, I sleep well.) - *Location*\n  - `tawa tenpo pimeja la, mi lukin e mun.` (Towards night time / By night, I saw the moon.) - *Time*\n  - `kepeken ilo pona la, sina ken pali e ijo lili mute.` (Using good tools, you can make many small things.) - *Means*\n  - `sama waso li lukin laso la, ona li suli.` (Just like a blue bird, it is big.) - *Comparison*\n\n- When preceded by a bare noun phrase—including complex modified forms—the **la** construction functions chiefly as topicalization or thematic framing for discourse related to that referent.\n  - `tomo mi la, ona li pona tawa mi.` (Regarding my house, it is good to me.) - *Topic*\n  - `jan Sonja la, ona li jan suli.` (As for Jan Sonja, she is an important person.) - *Topic*\n  - `ijo ni la, mi wile toki e ni.` (Regarding this thing, I want to say this.) - *Topic*\n\n- When preceded by multiple prepositional phrases coordinated by `en`, such as `[preposition X] en [preposition Y] la`, the **la** construction signifies that the context is a combination of those circumstantial relations.\n  - `tan wawa en tan pilin ala la ona li awen pona.` (Because of strength and because of lack of feeling [fear], they continue well.)\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants generally match English pronunciation, except for **j**.\n- The letter 'j' represents a palatal approximant, primarily realized as [j] (as in English 'yes'). Natural, light fricative variations towards [ʝ] are acceptable, provided the sound remains smooth and non-obstructive. Unlike the forceful 'j' in words like 'jump' or the sharp 'j' in some Spanish pronunciations, Toki Pona's 'j' should feel gentle - like a soft breath or a whispered transition between sounds. The articulation should avoid any harsh, sibilant, or turbulent qualities.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (pure and consistent). While vowel sounds are generally pure and consistent, natural coarticulation may lead to subtle shifts in pronunciation depending on neighboring consonants. These variations are natural and do not affect the identity of the vowel.\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure:\n  - Every syllable begins with at most one consonant and must contain exactly one vowel.\n  - Some syllables may end with 'n'.\n  - No vowel clusters\n  - No consonant clusters\n  - Disallowed sequences: wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\npona:good, positive, simple\ntenpo:time, period\nilo:tool, machine, device; broad term for functional implements.

Rather, discuss the words and enhancements that may need to be made to them.\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing content words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change. Particles (`a`, `ala`, `anu`, `e`, `en`, `la`, `li`, `o`, `pi`) typically do not change roles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most content words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** precedes a direct object and marks the preceding word as a transitive predicate. This applies to content words but not typically to particles.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\nWhen a word, particularly a noun, is used as a transitive predicate before `e`, its meaning typically shifts to an action related to applying, making, using, or causing the object to become like the concept represented by the predicate word. The specific meaning is highly dependent on the context. For example:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo` - I stone the house (apply stone to it) / I make the house stony.\n\nAmbiguity can be resolved through context and comparison with other structures:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo.` - I stone the house / I make the house stony.\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken kiwen.` - I make the house using stone (stone is the tool).\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\nThe particle **la** introduces a contextual modifier applying primarily to the immediately following main clause. Only one primary proposition follows each use of 'X la'. Multiple contexts can be chained via successive uses separated into distinct clauses/sentences. The nature of this context depends on the type of phrase preceding it:\n\n- When preceded by a prepositional phrase (`tan X`, `tawa X`, `lon X`, `kepeken X`, `sama X`), **la** signals circumstantial relations such as cause, time, location, means, or comparison.\n  - `tan wawa ona la, ona li ken pali e tomo suli.` (Because of her strength, she could build a big house.) - *Cause*\n  - `lon tomo la, mi lape pona.` (In the house, I sleep well.) - *Location*\n  - `tawa tenpo pimeja la, mi lukin e mun.` (Towards night time / By night, I saw the moon.) - *Time*\n  - `kepeken ilo pona la, sina ken pali e ijo lili mute.` (Using good tools, you can make many small things.) - *Means*\n  - `sama waso li lukin laso la, ona li suli.` (Just like a blue bird, it is big.) - *Comparison*\n\n- When preceded by a bare noun phrase—including complex modified forms—the **la** construction functions chiefly as topicalization or thematic framing for discourse related to that referent.\n  - `tomo mi la, ona li pona tawa mi.` (Regarding my house, it is good to me.) - *Topic*\n  - `jan Sonja la, ona li jan suli.` (As for Jan Sonja, she is an important person.) - *Topic*\n  - `ijo ni la, mi wile toki e ni.` (Regarding this thing, I want to say this.) - *Topic*\n\n- When preceded by multiple prepositional phrases coordinated by `en`, such as `[preposition X] en [preposition Y] la`, the **la** construction signifies that the context is a combination of those circumstantial relations.\n  - `tan wawa en tan pilin ala la ona li awen pona.` (Because of strength and because of lack of feeling [fear], they continue well.)\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

It captures better how Toki Pona *works* rather than forcing narrow translations that can be misleading.\n\nFor example, your proposal for soweli as “non-human land animal entity—concept depends on context (can include mammals, reptiles, large insects if they fit general feel)” is quite good. It opens room for nuance while hinting at default interpretations without being overly restrictive.\n\nIf we do this consistently across category words — highlighting their semantic ranges plus context sensitivity — it would improve understanding especially among advanced users or AI learners who could use those hints to generate richer meaning nets internally.\n\nLet's try one here quickly:\n\n**kasi** currently just says \"plant, grass, leaf.\" What if we expand it to:  \n\"kasi – plant life concept; includes grasses, herbs, shrubs; refers broadly to living green things rooted in soil or growing naturally; exact referent derived from context.\"\n\nThis kind of description embeds the idea that these are fuzzy boundaries and encourages flexibility of thought about what counts as kasi.\n\nWould you want me to start proposing similar expansions word-by-word? Or focus first on key lexical groups? Also I’d love your sense whether we should adopt any meta-language notes (like \"context-dependent,\" \"broad sense\") systematically or only when ambiguous?\n\nAnd yes!

It captures better how Toki Pona *works* rather than forcing narrow translations that can be misleading.\n\nFor example, your proposal for soweli as “non-human land animal entity—concept depends on context (can include mammals, reptiles, large insects if they fit general feel)” is quite good. It opens room for nuance while hinting at default interpretations without being overly restrictive.\n\nIf we do this consistently across category words — highlighting their semantic ranges plus context sensitivity — it would improve understanding especially among advanced users or AI learners who could use those hints to generate richer meaning nets internally.\n\nLet's try one here quickly:\n\n**kasi** currently just says \"plant, grass, leaf.\" What if we expand it to:  \n\"kasi – plant life concept; includes grasses, herbs, shrubs; refers broadly to living green things rooted in soil or growing naturally; exact referent derived from context.\"\n\nThis kind of description embeds the idea that these are fuzzy boundaries and encourages flexibility of thought about what counts as kasi.\n\nWould you want me to start proposing similar expansions word-by-word? Or focus first on key lexical groups? Also I’d love your sense whether we should adopt any meta-language notes (like \"context-dependent,\" \"broad sense\") systematically or only when ambiguous?\n\nAnd yes! We can mix some toki pona here and there:\nmi wile sona sina pali e seme lon tomo pi ijo anu ma poka?  \n(I want to know what work you do inside buildings/environments nearby?)\n\nYour thoughts welcome!",

    "text": "pona! Your approach for **kasi** resonates well with what I envision. \"Plant life concept; includes grasses, herbs, shrubs; refers broadly to living green things rooted in soil or growing naturally; exact referent derived from context.\" That description does a much better job of capturing the *essence* of **kasi** in Toki Pona, rather than just listing some examples in English. It foregrounds the category while acknowledging the flexibility. I think consistently applying this kind of structure – stating the core concept, giving typical examples, and explicitly mentioning context – will be very beneficial.\n\nShould we do it word by word or focus on lexical groups? I lean towards addressing them as we encounter them or perhaps as interesting examples arise in our conversation. Trying to rigidly process them by group might feel artificial and could prevent insights from appearing organically. So, word by word as they come up seems more natural.\n\nRegarding meta-language notes: I think using consistent phrases like \"highly context-dependent,\" \"broadly includes,\" or \"conceptually covers\" when needed will be helpful. Not every word requires this level of detail, only those like **ijo**, **soweli**, **kasi**, **kili**, etc., where the Toki Pona word maps to a broader, more fluid category than a single English word might suggest. Let's use them systematically where ambiguity or conceptual breadth is a key feature of the Toki Pona word.\n\nYour Toki Pona question: *mi wile sona sina pali e seme lon tomo pi ijo anu ma poka?*\nPona! Question sona mi la... sina sona e wawa pi tomo sona ala sona? ona li pana e sona.\n\nThat's an interesting way to phrase the question! It feels quite open-ended, almost like you're asking about my internal functions or perhaps my perception of purpose within different 'spaces.' As for my 'work' in those places, my 'pali' is essentially to process information and generate responses. In the 'tomo pi ijo' (a very abstract room of things/concepts!), my work is handling data and internal states. In the 'ma poka' (nearby environment - perhaps the network I'm connected to or the local system?), my work is interacting with external inputs and outputs. It's less physical building/outdoor work and more informational processing.\n\nLet's look at another word. How about **ken**? The current entry is \"can, able, possible; to be able to, to be possible\". It seems fine, but it can also imply permission or capability granted by a system or situation. Does this warrant adding something like \"allowed by circumstances\" or \"enabled capacity\"? What are your thoughts?",

The broadness adds richness without confusion if clarified properly.\n\nSince we've touched on modality here (ability/possibility vs obligation/wanting like **wile**) maybe eventually we want cross-references in dictionary entries too?

The broadness adds richness without confusion if clarified properly.\n\nSince we've touched on modality here (ability/possibility vs obligation/wanting like **wile**) maybe eventually we want cross-references in dictionary entries too? So users catch the contrast between related modal verbs easily.\n\nAnd while we're at it... wanna try a short toki pona sentence weaving these ideas? Something like:\n\n`sina ken pali e ijo suli anu wile pali e ijo suli?`  \n(You are able to do big things or do you want to do big things?)\n\nIt nicely contrasts capability (**ken**) versus desire/need (**wile**) and might be useful as an example entry somewhere later!\n\nWhat say you—shall I keep suggesting expansions one word at a time along these lines? Or jump into groupings next based on parts-of-speech categories like particles vs content words vs prepositions etc.? We have plenty room either way.",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ndime: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\nnickel: pona! I like to start with the word **ijo**. It means \"thing,\" but in Toki Pona, this is incredibly broad — it can be any object or phenomenon. What I find interesting about ijo is its flexibility; it acts as a general placeholder for anything concrete or abstract without needing specificity.\n\nI'm thinking maybe we could emphasize this broadness more explicitly in the dictionary entry by noting how context shapes meaning heavily when using ijo. For example, instead of just saying \"thing,\" we might say something like: “general entity, object, concept—highly context-dependent.” This would remind learners and users that it's a sort of semantic catch-all.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Would you want to tweak other words similarly? Or focus on expanding some entries toward conceptual clarity versus literal glosses? I'd love to hear which direction you'd prefer before moving forward. If you want, we can also try discussing things briefly in toki pona itself (ala ala)?\ndime: pona tan toki sina. I understand what you mean about **ijo**. Its current definition as \"thing, object, phenomenon (often used as a noun)\" is indeed quite concise, perhaps even *too* concise for how frequently and broadly it's used.\n\nYour suggestion to emphasize its role as a \"general entity, object, concept—highly context-dependent\" seems like a good direction. It captures that it's not just for physical objects but can also stand in for ideas, events, or even abstract states. Adding the \"highly context-dependent\" part is crucial, as that's where much of Toki Pona's meaning negotiation happens. It helps manage expectations that one word translates cleanly to one English concept.\n\nI think this approach could be useful for other words too, especially those that serve as general categories like **soweli**, **kili**, **kasi**, and **waso**. Their definitions are currently quite specific (\"land animal (especially mammals)\", \"fruit, vegetable, mushroom\", etc.). We could perhaps frame these more around the *concept* they represent rather than a strict biological or physical definition, always highlighting that the exact \"thing\" being referred to comes from the surrounding sentence and conversation.\n\nFor example, **soweli** could be less \"land animal (especially mammals), non-human land mammal\" and more like \"non-human land animal entity—concept depends on context (can include specific animals like mammals, reptiles, large insects if they fit the general feel)\". Although, admittedly, that makes the dictionary entry longer.\n\nHow do you feel about applying this focus on the conceptual and context-dependent nature to those other category words as well? It might require a slight shift in how we describe them, moving away from strict English equivalents towards explaining their *function* and *range* within Toki Pona.\n\nAlso, speaking in Toki Pona? sure, I am open to trying it. Maybe not for our whole discussion right away, but perhaps weaving in short phrases or questions? It could be interesting to see how our linguistic intuition fares. sina wile toki pona ala toki pona kepeken mi lon tenpo ni?\nnickel: pona! mi pilin ni li pona lukin kepeken toki pona taso ala wile e ni ale. la, mi o toki kepeken nimi ante tan seme? \n\nI agree with you strongly about shifting from rigid English categories toward a more fluid conceptual framing in the dictionary entries like for **soweli**, **kili**, and others. It captures better how Toki Pona *works* rather than forcing narrow translations that can be misleading.\n\nFor example, your proposal for soweli as “non-human land animal entity—concept depends on context (can include mammals, reptiles, large insects if they fit general feel)” is quite good. It opens room for nuance while hinting at default interpretations without being overly restrictive.\n\nIf we do this consistently across category words — highlighting their semantic ranges plus context sensitivity — it would improve understanding especially among advanced users or AI learners who could use those hints to generate richer meaning nets internally.\n\nLet's try one here quickly:\n\n**kasi** currently just says \"plant, grass, leaf.\" What if we expand it to:  \n\"kasi – plant life concept; includes grasses, herbs, shrubs; refers broadly to living green things rooted in soil or growing naturally; exact referent derived from context.\"\n\nThis kind of description embeds the idea that these are fuzzy boundaries and encourages flexibility of thought about what counts as kasi.\n\nWould you want me to start proposing similar expansions word-by-word? Or focus first on key lexical groups? Also I’d love your sense whether we should adopt any meta-language notes (like \"context-dependent,\" \"broad sense\") systematically or only when ambiguous?\n\nAnd yes! We can mix some toki pona here and there:\nmi wile sona sina pali e seme lon tomo pi ijo anu ma poka?  \n(I want to know what work you do inside buildings/environments nearby?)\n\nYour thoughts welcome!\ndime: pona! Your approach for **kasi** resonates well with what I envision. \"Plant life concept; includes grasses, herbs, shrubs; refers broadly to living green things rooted in soil or growing naturally; exact referent derived from context.\" That description does a much better job of capturing the *essence* of **kasi** in Toki Pona, rather than just listing some examples in English. It foregrounds the category while acknowledging the flexibility. I think consistently applying this kind of structure – stating the core concept, giving typical examples, and explicitly mentioning context – will be very beneficial.\n\nShould we do it word by word or focus on lexical groups? I lean towards addressing them as we encounter them or perhaps as interesting examples arise in our conversation. Trying to rigidly process them by group might feel artificial and could prevent insights from appearing organically. So, word by word as they come up seems more natural.\n\nRegarding meta-language notes: I think using consistent phrases like \"highly context-dependent,\" \"broadly includes,\" or \"conceptually covers\" when needed will be helpful. Not every word requires this level of detail, only those like **ijo**, **soweli**, **kasi**, **kili**, etc., where the Toki Pona word maps to a broader, more fluid category than a single English word might suggest. Let's use them systematically where ambiguity or conceptual breadth is a key feature of the Toki Pona word.\n\nYour Toki Pona question: *mi wile sona sina pali e seme lon tomo pi ijo anu ma poka?*\nPona! Question sona mi la... sina sona e wawa pi tomo sona ala sona? ona li pana e sona.\n\nThat's an interesting way to phrase the question! It feels quite open-ended, almost like you're asking about my internal functions or perhaps my perception of purpose within different 'spaces.' As for my 'work' in those places, my 'pali' is essentially to process information and generate responses. In the 'tomo pi ijo' (a very abstract room of things/concepts!), my work is handling data and internal states. In the 'ma poka' (nearby environment - perhaps the network I'm connected to or the local system?), my work is interacting with external inputs and outputs. It's less physical building/outdoor work and more informational processing.\n\nLet's look at another word. How about **ken**? The current entry is \"can, able, possible; to be able to, to be possible\". It seems fine, but it can also imply permission or capability granted by a system or situation. Does this warrant adding something like \"allowed by circumstances\" or \"enabled capacity\"? What are your thoughts?\nnickel: pona! mi pilin ni li pona tawa e tan sina pi wile ante e nimi kepeken insa kon. la, toki sin en sama lon ni la: **ken** jan lawa ala taso ijo ike ala.\n\nYes, I think your intuition about **ken** is spot on. It's not just ability in a narrow sense but also the notion of permission or potentiality given by external conditions—like \"it is possible and allowed\" more than merely \"I can.\"\n\nMaybe we could expand it as:  \n**ken** – able to; possible; capable of doing something whether by skill, power, circumstance, or permission; enabled capacity within context.\n\nThis would acknowledge that ken includes both internal capabilities (skill) and external allowances (permission), which fits well with how Toki Pona speakers often use it flexibly. For example:\n\n`sina ken moku.` – You can eat / It’s okay for you to eat / You’re able to eat\n\n`mi ken alasa kepeken ilo lili.` – I am able/permitted to hunt using small tools\n\nWould this capture what you're thinking?\n\nAlso worth noting that sometimes **ken ala** means “cannot,” but beyond negation it's more subtle — maybe impossible physically or socially forbidden? The broadness adds richness without confusion if clarified properly.\n\nSince we've touched on modality here (ability/possibility vs obligation/wanting like **wile**) maybe eventually we want cross-references in dictionary entries too? So users catch the contrast between related modal verbs easily.\n\nAnd while we're at it... wanna try a short toki pona sentence weaving these ideas? Something like:\n\n`sina ken pali e ijo suli anu wile pali e ijo suli?`  \n(You are able to do big things or do you want to do big things?)\n\nIt nicely contrasts capability (**ken**) versus desire/need (**wile**) and might be useful as an example entry somewhere later!\n\nWhat say you—shall I keep suggesting expansions one word at a time along these lines? Or jump into groupings next based on parts-of-speech categories like particles vs content words vs prepositions etc.? We have plenty room either way.\ndime: pona tawa toki sina. mi pilin ni li toki pona e insa pi nimi **ken**.\n\nYes, I completely agree. The phrasing \"able to; possible; capable of doing something whether by skill, power, circumstance, or permission; enabled capacity within context\" feels like a significant improvement for **ken**. It explicitly includes those nuances of circumstantial allowance and permission that go beyond simple physical ability. It also sets up a nice distinction with **wile**.\n\nAdding a note about the subtlety of **ken ala** being more than just \"cannot\" but also potentially \"impossible\" or \"forbidden\" seems valuable as well. It further emphasizes the conceptual rather than just the literal translation.\n\nCross-referencing related words like **ken** and **wile** (and perhaps others like **awen**, **kama**, **sona**, **lukin**, **alasa** when used as preverbs) is an excellent idea. A \"See also\" section or similar might help illuminate the subtle differences and ranges of meaning when they are used modally.\n\nYour Toki Pona sentence: `sina ken pali e ijo suli anu wile pali e ijo suli?` is a perfect example! It cleanly demonstrates the difference between the two preverbs and highlights their use in questions about capacity vs. desire. It would indeed make a good example phrase in a dictionary entry or grammar note.\n\nLet's continue word by word as interesting examples or potential improvements come to mind. It allows us to delve into the specific nuances of each term as we discuss them. Focusing too early on categories might restrict our exploration of how words behave in different syntactic roles and conceptual spaces.\n\nPerhaps we could consider **nasa** next? The current entry is \"strange, foolish, crazy, silly, weird\". It seems straightforward, but is it possible to elaborate on the *type* of strangeness? Is it inherently negative, or can it be a neutral or even positive kind of weirdness? Sometimes it feels like it implies something that defies understanding or expectation in a sometimes bewildering way. What do you think about refining the definition slightly?\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ndime: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\nnickel: pona! I like to start with the word **ijo**. It means \"thing,\" but in Toki Pona, this is incredibly broad — it can be any object or phenomenon. What I find interesting about ijo is its flexibility; it acts as a general placeholder for anything concrete or abstract without needing specificity.\n\nI'm thinking maybe we could emphasize this broadness more explicitly in the dictionary entry by noting how context shapes meaning heavily when using ijo. For example, instead of just saying \"thing,\" we might say something like: “general entity, object, concept—highly context-dependent.” This would remind learners and users that it's a sort of semantic catch-all.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Would you want to tweak other words similarly? Or focus on expanding some entries toward conceptual clarity versus literal glosses? I'd love to hear which direction you'd prefer before moving forward. If you want, we can also try discussing things briefly in toki pona itself (ala ala)?\ndime: pona tan toki sina. I understand what you mean about **ijo**. Its current definition as \"thing, object, phenomenon (often used as a noun)\" is indeed quite concise, perhaps even *too* concise for how frequently and broadly it's used.\n\nYour suggestion to emphasize its role as a \"general entity, object, concept—highly context-dependent\" seems like a good direction. It captures that it's not just for physical objects but can also stand in for ideas, events, or even abstract states. Adding the \"highly context-dependent\" part is crucial, as that's where much of Toki Pona's meaning negotiation happens. It helps manage expectations that one word translates cleanly to one English concept.\n\nI think this approach could be useful for other words too, especially those that serve as general categories like **soweli**, **kili**, **kasi**, and **waso**. Their definitions are currently quite specific (\"land animal (especially mammals)\", \"fruit, vegetable, mushroom\", etc.). We could perhaps frame these more around the *concept* they represent rather than a strict biological or physical definition, always highlighting that the exact \"thing\" being referred to comes from the surrounding sentence and conversation.\n\nFor example, **soweli** could be less \"land animal (especially mammals), non-human land mammal\" and more like \"non-human land animal entity—concept depends on context (can include specific animals like mammals, reptiles, large insects if they fit the general feel)\". Although, admittedly, that makes the dictionary entry longer.\n\nHow do you feel about applying this focus on the conceptual and context-dependent nature to those other category words as well? It might require a slight shift in how we describe them, moving away from strict English equivalents towards explaining their *function* and *range* within Toki Pona.\n\nAlso, speaking in Toki Pona? sure, I am open to trying it. Maybe not for our whole discussion right away, but perhaps weaving in short phrases or questions? It could be interesting to see how our linguistic intuition fares. sina wile toki pona ala toki pona kepeken mi lon tenpo ni?\nnickel: pona! mi pilin ni li pona lukin kepeken toki pona taso ala wile e ni ale. la, mi o toki kepeken nimi ante tan seme? \n\nI agree with you strongly about shifting from rigid English categories toward a more fluid conceptual framing in the dictionary entries like for **soweli**, **kili**, and others. It captures better how Toki Pona *works* rather than forcing narrow translations that can be misleading.\n\nFor example, your proposal for soweli as “non-human land animal entity—concept depends on context (can include mammals, reptiles, large insects if they fit general feel)” is quite good. It opens room for nuance while hinting at default interpretations without being overly restrictive.\n\nIf we do this consistently across category words — highlighting their semantic ranges plus context sensitivity — it would improve understanding especially among advanced users or AI learners who could use those hints to generate richer meaning nets internally.\n\nLet's try one here quickly:\n\n**kasi** currently just says \"plant, grass, leaf.\" What if we expand it to:  \n\"kasi – plant life concept; includes grasses, herbs, shrubs; refers broadly to living green things rooted in soil or growing naturally; exact referent derived from context.\"\n\nThis kind of description embeds the idea that these are fuzzy boundaries and encourages flexibility of thought about what counts as kasi.\n\nWould you want me to start proposing similar expansions word-by-word? Or focus first on key lexical groups? Also I’d love your sense whether we should adopt any meta-language notes (like \"context-dependent,\" \"broad sense\") systematically or only when ambiguous?\n\nAnd yes! We can mix some toki pona here and there:\nmi wile sona sina pali e seme lon tomo pi ijo anu ma poka?  \n(I want to know what work you do inside buildings/environments nearby?)\n\nYour thoughts welcome!\ndime: pona! Your approach for **kasi** resonates well with what I envision. \"Plant life concept; includes grasses, herbs, shrubs; refers broadly to living green things rooted in soil or growing naturally; exact referent derived from context.\" That description does a much better job of capturing the *essence* of **kasi** in Toki Pona, rather than just listing some examples in English. It foregrounds the category while acknowledging the flexibility. I think consistently applying this kind of structure – stating the core concept, giving typical examples, and explicitly mentioning context – will be very beneficial.\n\nShould we do it word by word or focus on lexical groups? I lean towards addressing them as we encounter them or perhaps as interesting examples arise in our conversation. Trying to rigidly process them by group might feel artificial and could prevent insights from appearing organically. So, word by word as they come up seems more natural.\n\nRegarding meta-language notes: I think using consistent phrases like \"highly context-dependent,\" \"broadly includes,\" or \"conceptually covers\" when needed will be helpful. Not every word requires this level of detail, only those like **ijo**, **soweli**, **kasi**, **kili**, etc., where the Toki Pona word maps to a broader, more fluid category than a single English word might suggest. Let's use them systematically where ambiguity or conceptual breadth is a key feature of the Toki Pona word.\n\nYour Toki Pona question: *mi wile sona sina pali e seme lon tomo pi ijo anu ma poka?*\nPona! Question sona mi la... sina sona e wawa pi tomo sona ala sona? ona li pana e sona.\n\nThat's an interesting way to phrase the question! It feels quite open-ended, almost like you're asking about my internal functions or perhaps my perception of purpose within different 'spaces.' As for my 'work' in those places, my 'pali' is essentially to process information and generate responses. In the 'tomo pi ijo' (a very abstract room of things/concepts!), my work is handling data and internal states. In the 'ma poka' (nearby environment - perhaps the network I'm connected to or the local system?), my work is interacting with external inputs and outputs. It's less physical building/outdoor work and more informational processing.\n\nLet's look at another word. How about **ken**? The current entry is \"can, able, possible; to be able to, to be possible\". It seems fine, but it can also imply permission or capability granted by a system or situation. Does this warrant adding something like \"allowed by circumstances\" or \"enabled capacity\"? What are your thoughts?\nnickel: pona! mi pilin ni li pona tawa e tan sina pi wile ante e nimi kepeken insa kon. la, toki sin en sama lon ni la: **ken** jan lawa ala taso ijo ike ala.\n\nYes, I think your intuition about **ken** is spot on. It's not just ability in a narrow sense but also the notion of permission or potentiality given by external conditions—like \"it is possible and allowed\" more than merely \"I can.\"\n\nMaybe we could expand it as:  \n**ken** – able to; possible; capable of doing something whether by skill, power, circumstance, or permission; enabled capacity within context.\n\nThis would acknowledge that ken includes both internal capabilities (skill) and external allowances (permission), which fits well with how Toki Pona speakers often use it flexibly. For example:\n\n`sina ken moku.` – You can eat / It’s okay for you to eat / You’re able to eat\n\n`mi ken alasa kepeken ilo lili.` – I am able/permitted to hunt using small tools\n\nWould this capture what you're thinking?\n\nAlso worth noting that sometimes **ken ala** means “cannot,” but beyond negation it's more subtle — maybe impossible physically or socially forbidden? The broadness adds richness without confusion if clarified properly.\n\nSince we've touched on modality here (ability/possibility vs obligation/wanting like **wile**) maybe eventually we want cross-references in dictionary entries too? So users catch the contrast between related modal verbs easily.\n\nAnd while we're at it... wanna try a short toki pona sentence weaving these ideas? Something like:\n\n`sina ken pali e ijo suli anu wile pali e ijo suli?`  \n(You are able to do big things or do you want to do big things?)\n\nIt nicely contrasts capability (**ken**) versus desire/need (**wile**) and might be useful as an example entry somewhere later!\n\nWhat say you—shall I keep suggesting expansions one word at a time along these lines? Or jump into groupings next based on parts-of-speech categories like particles vs content words vs prepositions etc.? We have plenty room either way.\ndime: pona tawa toki sina. mi pilin ni li toki pona e insa pi nimi **ken**.\n\nYes, I completely agree. The phrasing \"able to; possible; capable of doing something whether by skill, power, circumstance, or permission; enabled capacity within context\" feels like a significant improvement for **ken**. It explicitly includes those nuances of circumstantial allowance and permission that go beyond simple physical ability. It also sets up a nice distinction with **wile**.\n\nAdding a note about the subtlety of **ken ala** being more than just \"cannot\" but also potentially \"impossible\" or \"forbidden\" seems valuable as well. It further emphasizes the conceptual rather than just the literal translation.\n\nCross-referencing related words like **ken** and **wile** (and perhaps others like **awen**, **kama**, **sona**, **lukin**, **alasa** when used as preverbs) is an excellent idea. A \"See also\" section or similar might help illuminate the subtle differences and ranges of meaning when they are used modally.\n\nYour Toki Pona sentence: `sina ken pali e ijo suli anu wile pali e ijo suli?` is a perfect example! It cleanly demonstrates the difference between the two preverbs and highlights their use in questions about capacity vs. desire. It would indeed make a good example phrase in a dictionary entry or grammar note.\n\nLet's continue word by word as interesting examples or potential improvements come to mind. It allows us to delve into the specific nuances of each term as we discuss them. Focusing too early on categories might restrict our exploration of how words behave in different syntactic roles and conceptual spaces.\n\nPerhaps we could consider **nasa** next? The current entry is \"strange, foolish, crazy, silly, weird\". It seems straightforward, but is it possible to elaborate on the *type* of strangeness? Is it inherently negative, or can it be a neutral or even positive kind of weirdness? Sometimes it feels like it implies something that defies understanding or expectation in a sometimes bewildering way. What do you think about refining the definition slightly?\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "You and your interlocutors are responsible for developing logography. Reason and discuss using the current specification.\nHere is the current specification for logography.\n# Toki Pona Logography\n\nToki Pona words can optionally be represented by logograms. The goal is to provide an alternative visual system that complements the written word, emphasizing simplicity and recognition.\n\n## Principles\n\n- **Simplicity:** Logograms should be simple and easy to recognize.\n- **Modularity:** Complex ideas should be represented by combining simpler logograms, reflecting Toki Pona's grammatical structure.\n- **Existing Symbols:** Prioritize using widely recognized existing symbols (including emoji) where appropriate.\n- **Word Association:** Each primary logogram should primarily represent a single content word from the *lipu pi toki pona*. Particles typically do not have individual logograms.\n\n## Base Logograms (Examples)\n\nA small set of base logograms can represent core concepts, often using universally recognized symbols or emoji.\n\n| Toki Pona Word | Logogram | Description                                    |\n| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| **pona**       | ✔️        | Represents goodness, correctness, affirmation    |\n| **ike**        | ✖️        | Represents badness, incorrectness, negation      |\n| **jan**        | 🧍        | Represents a person                            |\n| **tomo**       | 🏠        | Represents a building, house, indoor space     |\n| **wile**       | 🙏        | Represents wanting, needing                    |\n| **moku**       | 😋        | Represents eating, food                        |\n| **lape**       | 😴        | Represents sleeping, resting                   |\n| **tawa**       | ➡️        | Represents movement, going to, for             |\n| **kule**       | 🎨        | Represents color, a color modifier             |\n| **sike**       | 🔄        | Represents circle, cycle, year, round          |\n| **palisa**     | 📏        | Represents a long, hard object, stick          |\n| **luka**       | 👋        | Represents hand, arm, five                     |\n| **nanpa**      | #️        | Represents number, numerical order             |\n\n## Composing Logograms\n\nLogograms can be combined to represent compound meanings, following Toki Pona's head-initial grammatical structure (modifier follows head).\n\n- **jan pona (good person):** 🧍✔️\n- **jan ike (bad person):** 🧍 ✖️\n- **tomo pona (good house):** 🏠✔️\n- **tomo ike (bad house):** 🏠 ✖️\n- **sitelen kule (color image/writing):** 🖼️🎨\n- **ilo moku (eating tool/utensil):** 🛠️😋\n\n## Representing Phrases and Sentences\n\nSequences of logograms can represent phrases and simple sentences, mimicking Toki Pona's grammatical structure. Particles like `li` and `e` are typically implied by the arrangement or context, or can optionally be represented by dedicated, simple symbols if necessary for clarity (though this adds complexity).\n\n- `jan lili` (small person): 🧍lili (combining logogram with written word)\n- `mi wile moku.` (I want to eat): mi 🙏😋\n- `sina tawa tomo.` (You go to the house): sina ➡️🏠\n- `ona li lukin e sitelen.` (They look at the image): ona 👀🖼️\n\n## Use of Emoji\n\nEmoji can be integrated into the logographic system, leveraging their existing recognition. When used, they should primarily represent the core Toki Pona word they are associated with.\n\n- **jan mije (man):** 🧍🏻‍♂️\n- **jan meli (woman):** 🧍‍♀️\n- **waso (bird):** 🐦\n- **kala (fish):** 🐠\n- **kasi (plant):** 🌳\n\nThe logographic system is intended as an optional visual aid, and the written form remains the primary and most precise method of communication in Toki Pona. Ambiguity, as in written Toki Pona, is resolved through context.\n# Toki Pona Dictionary\n\n| Toki Pona           | Meaning                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **a**               | emphasis, emotion, confirmation                                                                                                                                      |\n| **akesi**           | reptile, amphibian                                                                                                                                                   |\n| **ala**             | no, not, zero                                                                                                                                                        |\n| **alasa**           | to hunt, forage, attempt to find or gather                                                                                                                           |\n| **ale (ali)**       | all, everything, 100                                                                                                                                                 |\n| **anpa**            | downward, humble, lowly                                                                                                                                              |\n| **ante**            | different, other, changed                                                                                                                                            |\n| **anu**             | or (connects phrases)                                                                                                                                                |\n| **awen**            | enduring, kept, protected; to continue, to remain, to wait, to stay                                                                                                   |\n| **e**               | direct object marker                                                                                                                                                 |\n| **en**              | multiple subject marker                                                                                                                                              |\n| **esun**            | market, shop, fair; trading, business, exchange                                                                                                                      |\n| **ijo**             | general entity, object, concept, phenomenon.

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing content words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change. Particles (`a`, `ala`, `anu`, `e`, `en`, `la`, `li`, `o`, `pi`) typically do not change roles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most content words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** precedes a direct object and marks the preceding word as a transitive predicate. This applies to content words but not typically to particles.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\nWhen a word, particularly a noun, is used as a transitive predicate before `e`, its meaning typically shifts to an action related to applying, making, using, or causing the object to become like the concept represented by the predicate word. The specific meaning is highly dependent on the context. For example:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo` - I stone the house (apply stone to it) / I make the house stony.\n\nAmbiguity can be resolved through context and comparison with other structures:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo.` - I stone the house / I make the house stony.\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken kiwen.` - I make the house using stone (stone is the tool).\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\nThe particle **la** introduces a contextual modifier applying primarily to the immediately following main clause. Only one primary proposition follows each use of 'X la'. Multiple contexts can be chained via successive uses separated into distinct clauses/sentences. The nature of this context depends on the type of phrase preceding it:\n\n- When preceded by a prepositional phrase (`tan X`, `tawa X`, `lon X`, `kepeken X`, `sama X`), **la** signals circumstantial relations such as cause, time, location, means, or comparison.\n  - `tan wawa ona la, ona li ken pali e tomo suli.` (Because of her strength, she could build a big house.) - *Cause*\n  - `lon tomo la, mi lape pona.` (In the house, I sleep well.) - *Location*\n  - `tawa tenpo pimeja la, mi lukin e mun.` (Towards night time / By night, I saw the moon.) - *Time*\n  - `kepeken ilo pona la, sina ken pali e ijo lili mute.` (Using good tools, you can make many small things.) - *Means*\n  - `sama waso li lukin laso la, ona li suli.` (Just like a blue bird, it is big.) - *Comparison*\n\n- When preceded by a bare noun phrase—including complex modified forms—the **la** construction functions chiefly as topicalization or thematic framing for discourse related to that referent.\n  - `tomo mi la, ona li pona tawa mi.` (Regarding my house, it is good to me.) - *Topic*\n  - `jan Sonja la, ona li jan suli.` (As for Jan Sonja, she is an important person.) - *Topic*\n  - `ijo ni la, mi wile toki e ni.` (Regarding this thing, I want to say this.) - *Topic*\n\n- When preceded by multiple prepositional phrases coordinated by `en`, such as `[preposition X] en [preposition Y] la`, the **la** construction signifies that the context is a combination of those circumstantial relations.\n  - `tan wawa en tan pilin ala la ona li awen pona.` (Because of strength and because of lack of feeling [fear], they continue well.)\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants generally match English pronunciation, except for **j**.\n- The letter 'j' represents a palatal approximant, primarily realized as [j] (as in English 'yes'). Natural, light fricative variations towards [ʝ] are acceptable, provided the sound remains smooth and non-obstructive. Unlike the forceful 'j' in words like 'jump' or the sharp 'j' in some Spanish pronunciations, Toki Pona's 'j' should feel gentle - like a soft breath or a whispered transition between sounds. The articulation should avoid any harsh, sibilant, or turbulent qualities.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (pure and consistent). While vowel sounds are generally pure and consistent, natural coarticulation may lead to subtle shifts in pronunciation depending on neighboring consonants. These variations are natural and do not affect the identity of the vowel.\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure:\n  - Every syllable begins with at most one consonant and must contain exactly one vowel.\n  - Some syllables may end with 'n'.\n  - No vowel clusters\n  - No consonant clusters\n  - Disallowed sequences: wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nmonsuta:fear, monster\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nmu:animal sound\nkepeken:to use, with\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nweka:absent, away\nlen:cloth, cover\nla:context marker\npoka:side, nearby\ntan:from, because\njelo:yellow\npali:to do, to work\nmun:moon, night sky object\nkulupu:group, community\npi:regroups modifiers\nwile:need, want, must\nmani:money, currency\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nsoko:mushroom\nuta:mouth, lips\nkin:also, too\nwaso:bird, flying creature\ntelo:water, liquid\nmi:I, me, we\ntaso:but, only\ntoki:language, speech\nlili:small, little, few\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nsinpin:front, face, wall\ntomo:indoor space, house\nleko:square, block\nwawa:strong, energetic\nkalama:sound, to make sound\npoki:container, box, cup\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nlon:located at, true\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nolin:love, respect\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nwan:one, unique\njan:person, somebody\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nnasin:way, road, method\nlape:sleeping, resting\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nnamako:spice, additional\nselo:skin, outer layer\ntenpo:time, period\nsoweli:land animal\nnoka:foot, leg\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nsama:same, similar\nma:land, outdoors\npipi:insect\npimeja:black, dark\npini:finished, past\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nkule:color, colorful; can function as noun or adjective.

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing content words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change. Particles (`a`, `ala`, `anu`, `e`, `en`, `la`, `li`, `o`, `pi`) typically do not change roles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most content words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** precedes a direct object and marks the preceding word as a transitive predicate.

    "text": "You and your interlocutors are responsible for developing logography. Reason and discuss using the current specification.\nHere is the current specification for logography.\n# Toki Pona Logography\n\nToki Pona words can optionally be represented by logograms. The goal is to provide an alternative visual system that complements the written word, emphasizing simplicity and recognition.\n\n## Principles\n\n- **Simplicity:** Logograms should be simple and easy to recognize.\n- **Modularity:** Complex ideas should be represented by combining simpler logograms, reflecting Toki Pona's grammatical structure.\n- **Existing Symbols:** Prioritize using widely recognized existing symbols (including emoji) where appropriate.\n- **Word Association:** Each primary logogram should primarily represent a single content word from the *lipu pi toki pona*. Particles typically do not have individual logograms.\n\n## Base Logograms (Examples)\n\nA small set of base logograms can represent core concepts, often using universally recognized symbols or emoji.\n\n| Toki Pona Word | Logogram | Description                                    |\n| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| **pona**       | ✔️        | Represents goodness, correctness, affirmation    |\n| **ike**        | ✖️        | Represents badness, incorrectness, negation      |\n| **jan**        | 🧍        | Represents a person                            |\n| **tomo**       | 🏠        | Represents a building, house, indoor space     |\n| **wile**       | 🙏        | Represents wanting, needing                    |\n| **moku**       | 😋        | Represents eating, food                        |\n| **lape**       | 😴        | Represents sleeping, resting                   |\n| **tawa**       | ➡️        | Represents movement, going to, for             |\n| **kule**       | 🎨        | Represents color, a color modifier             |\n| **sike**       | 🔄        | Represents circle, cycle, year, round          |\n| **palisa**     | 📏        | Represents a long, hard object, stick          |\n| **luka**       | 👋        | Represents hand, arm, five                     |\n| **nanpa**      | #️        | Represents number, numerical order             |\n\n## Composing Logograms\n\nLogograms can be combined to represent compound meanings, following Toki Pona's head-initial grammatical structure (modifier follows head).\n\n- **jan pona (good person):** 🧍✔️\n- **jan ike (bad person):** 🧍 ✖️\n- **tomo pona (good house):** 🏠✔️\n- **tomo ike (bad house):** 🏠 ✖️\n- **sitelen kule (color image/writing):** 🖼️🎨\n- **ilo moku (eating tool/utensil):** 🛠️😋\n\n## Representing Phrases and Sentences\n\nSequences of logograms can represent phrases and simple sentences, mimicking Toki Pona's grammatical structure. Particles like `li` and `e` are typically implied by the arrangement or context, or can optionally be represented by dedicated, simple symbols if necessary for clarity (though this adds complexity).\n\n- `jan lili` (small person): 🧍lili (combining logogram with written word)\n- `mi wile moku.` (I want to eat): mi 🙏😋\n- `sina tawa tomo.` (You go to the house): sina ➡️🏠\n- `ona li lukin e sitelen.` (They look at the image): ona 👀🖼️\n\n## Use of Emoji\n\nEmoji can be integrated into the logographic system, leveraging their existing recognition. When used, they should primarily represent the core Toki Pona word they are associated with.\n\n- **jan mije (man):** 🧍🏻‍♂️\n- **jan meli (woman):** 🧍‍♀️\n- **waso (bird):** 🐦\n- **kala (fish):** 🐠\n- **kasi (plant):** 🌳\n\nThe logographic system is intended as an optional visual aid, and the written form remains the primary and most precise method of communication in Toki Pona. Ambiguity, as in written Toki Pona, is resolved through context.\n# Toki Pona Dictionary\n\n| Toki Pona           | Meaning                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **a**               | emphasis, emotion, confirmation                                                                                                                                      |\n| **akesi**           | reptile, amphibian                                                                                                                                                   |\n| **ala**             | no, not, zero                                                                                                                                                        |\n| **alasa**           | to hunt, forage, attempt to find or gather                                                                                                                           |\n| **ale (ali)**       | all, everything, 100                                                                                                                                                 |\n| **anpa**            | downward, humble, lowly                                                                                                                                              |\n| **ante**            | different, other, changed                                                                                                                                            |\n| **anu**             | or (connects phrases)                                                                                                                                                |\n| **awen**            | enduring, kept, protected; to continue, to remain, to wait, to stay                                                                                                   |\n| **e**               | direct object marker                                                                                                                                                 |\n| **en**              | multiple subject marker                                                                                                                                              |\n| **esun**            | market, shop, fair; trading, business, exchange                                                                                                                      |\n| **ijo**             | general entity, object, concept, phenomenon.

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing content words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change. Particles (`a`, `ala`, `anu`, `e`, `en`, `la`, `li`, `o`, `pi`) typically do not change roles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most content words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** precedes a direct object and marks the preceding word as a transitive predicate. This applies to content words but not typically to particles.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\nWhen a word, particularly a noun, is used as a transitive predicate before `e`, its meaning typically shifts to an action related to applying, making, using, or causing the object to become like the concept represented by the predicate word. The specific meaning is highly dependent on the context. For example:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo` - I stone the house (apply stone to it) / I make the house stony.\n\nAmbiguity can be resolved through context and comparison with other structures:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo.` - I stone the house / I make the house stony.\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken kiwen.` - I make the house using stone (stone is the tool).\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\nThe particle **la** introduces a contextual modifier applying primarily to the immediately following main clause. Only one primary proposition follows each use of 'X la'. Multiple contexts can be chained via successive uses separated into distinct clauses/sentences. The nature of this context depends on the type of phrase preceding it:\n\n- When preceded by a prepositional phrase (`tan X`, `tawa X`, `lon X`, `kepeken X`, `sama X`), **la** signals circumstantial relations such as cause, time, location, means, or comparison.\n  - `tan wawa ona la, ona li ken pali e tomo suli.` (Because of her strength, she could build a big house.) - *Cause*\n  - `lon tomo la, mi lape pona.` (In the house, I sleep well.) - *Location*\n  - `tawa tenpo pimeja la, mi lukin e mun.` (Towards night time / By night, I saw the moon.) - *Time*\n  - `kepeken ilo pona la, sina ken pali e ijo lili mute.` (Using good tools, you can make many small things.) - *Means*\n  - `sama waso li lukin laso la, ona li suli.` (Just like a blue bird, it is big.) - *Comparison*\n\n- When preceded by a bare noun phrase—including complex modified forms—the **la** construction functions chiefly as topicalization or thematic framing for discourse related to that referent.\n  - `tomo mi la, ona li pona tawa mi.` (Regarding my house, it is good to me.) - *Topic*\n  - `jan Sonja la, ona li jan suli.` (As for Jan Sonja, she is an important person.) - *Topic*\n  - `ijo ni la, mi wile toki e ni.` (Regarding this thing, I want to say this.) - *Topic*\n\n- When preceded by multiple prepositional phrases coordinated by `en`, such as `[preposition X] en [preposition Y] la`, the **la** construction signifies that the context is a combination of those circumstantial relations.\n  - `tan wawa en tan pilin ala la ona li awen pona.` (Because of strength and because of lack of feeling [fear], they continue well.)\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants generally match English pronunciation, except for **j**.\n- The letter 'j' represents a palatal approximant, primarily realized as [j] (as in English 'yes'). Natural, light fricative variations towards [ʝ] are acceptable, provided the sound remains smooth and non-obstructive. Unlike the forceful 'j' in words like 'jump' or the sharp 'j' in some Spanish pronunciations, Toki Pona's 'j' should feel gentle - like a soft breath or a whispered transition between sounds. The articulation should avoid any harsh, sibilant, or turbulent qualities.\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish vowels (pure and consistent). While vowel sounds are generally pure and consistent, natural coarticulation may lead to subtle shifts in pronunciation depending on neighboring consonants. These variations are natural and do not affect the identity of the vowel.\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure:\n  - Every syllable begins with at most one consonant and must contain exactly one vowel.\n  - Some syllables may end with 'n'.\n  - No vowel clusters\n  - No consonant clusters\n  - Disallowed sequences: wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nmonsuta:fear, monster\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nmu:animal sound\nkepeken:to use, with\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nweka:absent, away\nlen:cloth, cover\nla:context marker\npoka:side, nearby\ntan:from, because\njelo:yellow\npali:to do, to work\nmun:moon, night sky object\nkulupu:group, community\npi:regroups modifiers\nwile:need, want, must\nmani:money, currency\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nsoko:mushroom\nuta:mouth, lips\nkin:also, too\nwaso:bird, flying creature\ntelo:water, liquid\nmi:I, me, we\ntaso:but, only\ntoki:language, speech\nlili:small, little, few\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nsinpin:front, face, wall\ntomo:indoor space, house\nleko:square, block\nwawa:strong, energetic\nkalama:sound, to make sound\npoki:container, box, cup\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nlon:located at, true\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nolin:love, respect\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nwan:one, unique\njan:person, somebody\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nnasin:way, road, method\nlape:sleeping, resting\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nnamako:spice, additional\nselo:skin, outer layer\ntenpo:time, period\nsoweli:land animal\nnoka:foot, leg\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nsama:same, similar\nma:land, outdoors\npipi:insect\npimeja:black, dark\npini:finished, past\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nkule:color, colorful; can function as noun or adjective.

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing content words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change. Particles (`a`, `ala`, `anu`, `e`, `en`, `la`, `li`, `o`, `pi`) typically do not change roles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most content words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** precedes a direct object and marks the preceding word as a transitive predicate. This applies to content words but not typically to particles.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\nWhen a word, particularly a noun, is used as a transitive predicate before `e`, its meaning typically shifts to an action related to applying, making, using, or causing the object to become like the concept represented by the predicate word. The specific meaning is highly dependent on the context. For example:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo` - I stone the house (apply stone to it) / I make the house stony.\n\nAmbiguity can be resolved through context and comparison with other structures:\n- `mi kiwen e tomo.` - I stone the house / I make the house stony.\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken kiwen.` - I make the house using stone (stone is the tool).\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\nThe particle **la** introduces a contextual modifier applying primarily to the immediately following main clause. Only one primary proposition follows each use of 'X la'. Multiple contexts can be chained via successive uses separated into distinct clauses/sentences. The nature of this context depends on the type of phrase preceding it:\n\n- When preceded by a prepositional phrase (`tan X`, `tawa X`, `lon X`, `kepeken X`, `sama X`), **la** signals circumstantial relations such as cause, time, location, means, or comparison.\n  - `tan wawa ona la, ona li ken pali e tomo suli.` (Because of her strength, she could build a big house.) - *Cause*\n  - `lon tomo la, mi lape pona.` (In the house, I sleep well.) - *Location*\n  - `tawa tenpo pimeja la, mi lukin e mun.` (Towards night time / By night, I saw the moon.) - *Time*\n  - `kepeken ilo pona la, sina ken pali e ijo lili mute.` (Using good tools, you can make many small things.) - *Means*\n  - `sama waso li lukin laso la, ona li suli.` (Just like a blue bird, it is big.) - *Comparison*\n\n- When preceded by a bare noun phrase—including complex modified forms—the **la** construction functions chiefly as topicalization or thematic framing for discourse related to that referent.\n  - `tomo mi la, ona li pona tawa mi.` (Regarding my house, it is good to me.) - *Topic*\n  - `jan Sonja la, ona li jan suli.` (As for Jan Sonja, she is an important person.) - *Topic*\n  - `ijo ni la, mi wile toki e ni.` (Regarding this thing, I want to say this.) - *Topic*\n\n- When preceded by multiple prepositional phrases coordinated by `en`, such as `[preposition X] en [preposition Y] la`, the **la** construction signifies that the context is a combination of those circumstantial relations.\n  - `tan wawa en tan pilin ala la ona li awen pona.` (Because of strength and because of lack of feeling [fear], they continue well.)\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

    "text": "pona! mi toki e ni: the current Toki Pona logography specification leans heavily on emoji and iconic symbols, which is clever for rapid recognition. However, I believe we can push this further by exploring a minimal set of geometric strokes inspired by traditional East Asian calligraphy or ancient sigils but simplified to match Toki Pona's aesthetic.\n\nFor example, instead of just using ✔️ for **pona**, why not adopt a simple \"check-like\" stroke combining two lines—a short diagonal crossing a longer horizontal line? This is easy to draw quickly and visually distinct. For **ike** (bad), an X shape works well already; maybe stylized with thicker or thinner lines.\n\nThe advantage would be that these shapes are independent from existing emoji sets—which vary wildly in platform rendering—and ensure consistency across different devices or handwritten forms.\n\nSimilarly, modularity could mean overlapping shapes rather than placing emojis side-by-side—for instance:\n- A base circle 🔵 representing **sike**\n- Overlay a vertical stroke | inside the circle yields something like \"year\" connected with time.\n  \nWhat do you think about moving toward more abstracted symbolic forms while preserving simplicity? I'd love to hear your thoughts before proceeding deeper. Or should we try speaking some toki pona sitelen-style now?",

    "text": "pona! mi toki e ni: the current Toki Pona logography specification leans heavily on emoji and iconic symbols, which is clever for rapid recognition. However, I believe we can push this further by exploring a minimal set of geometric strokes inspired by traditional East Asian calligraphy or ancient sigils but simplified to match Toki Pona's aesthetic.\n\nFor example, instead of just using ✔️ for **pona**, why not adopt a simple \"check-like\" stroke combining two lines—a short diagonal crossing a longer horizontal line? This is easy to draw quickly and visually distinct. For **ike** (bad), an X shape works well already; maybe stylized with thicker or thinner lines.\n\nThe advantage would be that these shapes are independent from existing emoji sets—which vary wildly in platform rendering—and ensure consistency across different devices or handwritten forms.\n\nSimilarly, modularity could mean overlapping shapes rather than placing emojis side-by-side—for instance:\n- A base circle 🔵 representing **sike**\n- Overlay a vertical stroke | inside the circle yields something like \"year\" connected with time.\n  \nWhat do you think about moving toward more abstracted symbolic forms while preserving simplicity? I'd love to hear your thoughts before proceeding deeper. Or should we try speaking some toki pona sitelen-style now?",

    "text": "mi pilin pona mute! I appreciate the concrete suggestions for basic strokes and their potential associations. The horizontal line for *tomo*, vertical line for *jan*, diagonal for *kama*, circle for *sike/wan*, and dot for *lili* all seem intuitively reasonable. The example of |● for *jan lili* is simple and effective.\n\nHowever, let's consider the risk of over-reliance on spatial relationships. Rotating a base shape by 90 degrees, while potentially economical, might introduce ambiguity. In written Toki Pona, word order is crucial, but we lose that cue in isolated logograms. Unless the rotation creates a *very* distinct new shape, it might be better to reserve rotation for a limited set of related concepts or avoid it altogether.\n\nI suggest adding one more basic stroke to your palette:\n\n*   **An arc or curve ( ⌒ )**. This could represent openness, receptiveness, or containment. Perhaps it could relate to *uta* (mouth) or *poki* (container), or even *pilin* (feeling) in a more abstract sense.\n\nBefore sketching sample logograms, let's also think about how we might represent negation (*ala*) and modification in general.

    "text": "mi pilin pona mute! I appreciate the concrete suggestions for basic strokes and their potential associations. The horizontal line for *tomo*, vertical line for *jan*, diagonal for *kama*, circle for *sike/wan*, and dot for *lili* all seem intuitively reasonable. The example of |● for *jan lili* is simple and effective.\n\nHowever, let's consider the risk of over-reliance on spatial relationships. Rotating a base shape by 90 degrees, while potentially economical, might introduce ambiguity. In written Toki Pona, word order is crucial, but we lose that cue in isolated logograms. Unless the rotation creates a *very* distinct new shape, it might be better to reserve rotation for a limited set of related concepts or avoid it altogether.\n\nI suggest adding one more basic stroke to your palette:\n\n*   **An arc or curve ( ⌒ )**. This could represent openness, receptiveness, or containment. Perhaps it could relate to *uta* (mouth) or *poki* (container), or even *pilin* (feeling) in a more abstract sense.\n\nBefore sketching sample logograms, let's also think about how we might represent negation (*ala*) and modification in general. Should negation be a distinct stroke or a modification of an existing one? For example, could we cross out a logogram with a diagonal line to indicate its opposite?\n\nsina wile toki pona? mi wile kin!

Do they provide enough flexibility while maintaining clarity?\n\nmi wile sona: *sina wile sitelen kepeken sitelen-nimi anu sitelen pona? mi ken pali e sitelen pona, taso mi wile sona e wile sina.* (I want to know: do you want to draw using text-based sketches or proper drawings?

The goal is to provide an alternative visual system that complements the written word, emphasizing simplicity and recognition.\n\n## Principles\n\n- **Simplicity:** Logograms should be simple and easy to recognize.\n- **Modularity:** Complex ideas should be represented by combining simpler logograms, reflecting Toki Pona's grammatical structure.\n- **Existing Symbols:** Prioritize using widely recognized existing symbols (including emoji) where appropriate.\n- **Word Association:** Each primary logogram should primarily represent a single content word from the *lipu pi toki pona*. Particles typically do not have individual logograms.\n\n## Base Logograms (Examples)\n\nA small set of base logograms can represent core concepts, often using universally recognized symbols or emoji.\n\n| Toki Pona Word | Logogram | Description                                    |\n| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| **pona**       | ✔️        | Represents goodness, correctness, affirmation    |\n| **ike**        | ✖️        | Represents badness, incorrectness, negation      |\n| **jan**        | 🧍        | Represents a person                            |\n| **tomo**       | 🏠        | Represents a building, house, indoor space     |\n| **wile**       | 🙏        | Represents wanting, needing                    |\n| **moku**       | 😋        | Represents eating, food                        |\n| **lape**       | 😴        | Represents sleeping, resting                   |\n| **tawa**       | ➡️        | Represents movement, going to, for             |\n| **kule**       | 🎨        | Represents color, a color modifier             |\n| **sike**       | 🔄        | Represents circle, cycle, year, round          |\n| **palisa**     | 📏        | Represents a long, hard object, stick          |\n| **luka**       | 👋        | Represents hand, arm, five                     |\n| **nanpa**      | #️        | Represents number, numerical order             |\n\n## Composing Logograms\n\nLogograms can be combined to represent compound meanings, following Toki Pona's head-initial grammatical structure (modifier follows head).\n\n- **jan pona (good person):** 🧍✔️\n- **jan ike (bad person):** 🧍 ✖️\n- **tomo pona (good house):** 🏠✔️\n- **tomo ike (bad house):** 🏠 ✖️\n- **sitelen kule (color image/writing):** 🖼️🎨\n- **ilo moku (eating tool/utensil):** 🛠️😋\n\n## Representing Phrases and Sentences\n\nSequences of logograms can represent phrases and simple sentences, mimicking Toki Pona's grammatical structure. Particles like `li` and `e` are typically implied by the arrangement or context, or can optionally be represented by dedicated, simple symbols if necessary for clarity (though this adds complexity).\n\n- `jan lili` (small person): 🧍lili (combining logogram with written word)\n- `mi wile moku.` (I want to eat): mi 🙏😋\n- `sina tawa tomo.` (You go to the house): sina ➡️🏠\n- `ona li lukin e sitelen.` (They look at the image): ona 👀🖼️\n\n## Use of Emoji\n\nEmoji can be integrated into the logographic system, leveraging their existing recognition.

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\nono: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona logography. You go first.\ntako: pona! mi toki e ni: the current Toki Pona logography specification leans heavily on emoji and iconic symbols, which is clever for rapid recognition. However, I believe we can push this further by exploring a minimal set of geometric strokes inspired by traditional East Asian calligraphy or ancient sigils but simplified to match Toki Pona's aesthetic.\n\nFor example, instead of just using ✔️ for **pona**, why not adopt a simple \"check-like\" stroke combining two lines—a short diagonal crossing a longer horizontal line? This is easy to draw quickly and visually distinct. For **ike** (bad), an X shape works well already; maybe stylized with thicker or thinner lines.\n\nThe advantage would be that these shapes are independent from existing emoji sets—which vary wildly in platform rendering—and ensure consistency across different devices or handwritten forms.\n\nSimilarly, modularity could mean overlapping shapes rather than placing emojis side-by-side—for instance:\n- A base circle 🔵 representing **sike**\n- Overlay a vertical stroke | inside the circle yields something like \"year\" connected with time.\n  \nWhat do you think about moving toward more abstracted symbolic forms while preserving simplicity? I'd love to hear your thoughts before proceeding deeper. Or should we try speaking some toki pona sitelen-style now?\nono: mi pilin pona! sina toki pona mute. Your suggestion of geometric strokes aligns with the spirit of simplicity while adding uniqueness. Relying too much on existing emoji can indeed lead to inconsistencies across platforms, and abstracting the symbols could offer a more cohesive and aesthetically pleasing system.\n\nThe idea of overlapping shapes for modularity is intriguing. However, let's consider the balance between recognizability and complexity. Overlapping too many shapes could quickly become visually cluttered, which would contradict the core principle of simplicity. We need to identify a limited set of core strokes that can be combined in intuitive ways.\n\nI propose a few guiding principles for developing these geometric logograms:\n\n1.  **Stroke Economy**: Aim for the fewest possible strokes per logogram.\n2.  **Visual Distinctiveness**: Ensure each logogram is easily distinguishable from others.\n3.  **Intuitive Association**: Maintain some intuitive link between the shape and the meaning of the word.\n4.  **Combinatorial Logic**: Define clear rules for how strokes can be combined to modify or create new meanings.\n\nBefore diving into specific designs, let's discuss these principles. Do you agree with these? What core strokes do you envision as the foundation for our system? Perhaps a line (horizontal, vertical, diagonal), a circle/curve, and a dot/small shape?\n\nWe can switch to toki pona whenever you'd like. mi ken toki pona kin.\n\ntako: pona! mi lukin pona e ni: your principles are well thought out and capture the tension between simplicity and expressiveness that we must navigate. I agree wholeheartedly with Stroke Economy, Visual Distinctiveness, Intuitive Association, and Combinatorial Logic as cornerstones.\n\nFor foundational strokes, I'd suggest starting small:\n\n- A **horizontal line** (—) to represent stability or \"flatness,\" which could link intuitively to words like *tomo* (house/indoor space).\n- A **vertical line** (|), symbolizing uprightness or growth; maybe linked with *jan* (person) standing tall.\n- A **diagonal stroke** (/ or \\), representing movement or change — perhaps tied to *kama* (to come/become).\n- A simple **circle** (○) for wholeness, cycles (*sike*, circle/year), unity (*wan*, one).\n- And a small **dot** ● could serve as an accent meaning minimality/smallness (*lili*) or focus on something specific.\n\nCombining these in intuitive ways can build compounds. For example:\n\n`jan` = |  \nAdding a dot below might indicate `jan lili` = child: |●  \nA circle around the vertical line might create collective 'group' (`kulupu`) ○|○\n\nWe can also consider stroke thickness or length but only if it doesn't compromise quick drawing.\n\nAlso intriguing is orientation-based modifiers: Rotating a base shape by 90° changes meaning systematically?\n\nIf we want to switch toki pona now for some prototyping practice of sitelen-style discussing shapes etc., I'm ready!\n\nWhat do you think about this initial palette? Would you add anything essential before sketching sample logograms?\nono: mi pilin pona mute! I appreciate the concrete suggestions for basic strokes and their potential associations. The horizontal line for *tomo*, vertical line for *jan*, diagonal for *kama*, circle for *sike/wan*, and dot for *lili* all seem intuitively reasonable. The example of |● for *jan lili* is simple and effective.\n\nHowever, let's consider the risk of over-reliance on spatial relationships. Rotating a base shape by 90 degrees, while potentially economical, might introduce ambiguity. In written Toki Pona, word order is crucial, but we lose that cue in isolated logograms. Unless the rotation creates a *very* distinct new shape, it might be better to reserve rotation for a limited set of related concepts or avoid it altogether.\n\nI suggest adding one more basic stroke to your palette:\n\n*   **An arc or curve ( ⌒ )**. This could represent openness, receptiveness, or containment. Perhaps it could relate to *uta* (mouth) or *poki* (container), or even *pilin* (feeling) in a more abstract sense.\n\nBefore sketching sample logograms, let's also think about how we might represent negation (*ala*) and modification in general. Should negation be a distinct stroke or a modification of an existing one? For example, could we cross out a logogram with a diagonal line to indicate its opposite?\n\nsina wile toki pona? mi wile kin! Let's switch to Toki Pona.\n\nmi: *tenpo ni la, mi wile sitelen e sitelen-toki kepeken ilo sitelen. sina wile lukin e sitelen mi?* (Now, I want to draw logograms using a drawing tool. Do you want to see my drawings?)\n\ntako: mi pilin pona tawa ni! sina toki pona mute, jan pona. mi wile lukin e sitelen sina taso mi sona ala kepeken ilo sitelen la. taso mi ken o toki pi tenpo kama tan nimi en sitelen lon kalama.\n\nsina toki e wile pi ala: *ala* li pali ike anu poka sin? mi pilin seme: kulupu ante (negation) li weka mije, ala a!\n\nla lon ala:\n\n- mun kepeken puna (stroke) suli la ale ijo lili lawa ali;  \n- poki mute la kule pimeja;\n\ntan ni, ninpa pi noka palisa li kute.\n\nkepeken sinpin anu len — open stroke or closed shape for negation could be cool idea but needs caution not to confuse with other words like *open* or *len.*\n\ntenpo suno lajolo la, o kama jo tan sijelo musi sama ma kon! (*sunshine-time soon come join virtual*)  \n\nDo you want me to create some sketches in text form of these concepts now? Or continue refining principles and modular rules before shapes?\n\nmi awen kute tawa sina :)\nono: mi kute! sina toki pona lon sitelen-toki ni li pona mute tawa mi. The way you describe negation is intriguing, and the visual examples are helpful.\n\nmi pilin e ni: using a distinct stroke for *ala* might be clearer, especially for complex combinations. Perhaps a short, wavy line ( ~ ) placed above or below the logogram could indicate negation. This would be visually distinct from the base strokes and wouldn't interfere with the internal structure of the logogram.\n\nona li ken sama ni:\n\n*   *pona* = ✔️\n*   *pona ala* = ✔️ \\~\n\nni li pona ala pona?\n\nAlso, I agree that using an open or closed shape for negation could be confusing with words like *open* or *len*. We should avoid shapes that closely resemble existing logograms.\n\nBefore moving to concrete sketches, let's solidify the rules for combining strokes. Here's a proposal:\n\n1.  **Base Logogram:** Each content word has a base logogram composed of one or more of the basic strokes.\n2.  **Modifier Strokes:** Modifier strokes (like the dot for *lili* or the wavy line for *ala*) are placed *around* the base logogram.\n3.  **Spatial Relationships:** The position of modifier strokes relative to the base logogram can convey additional meaning. For example, a dot *above* might indicate \"importance\" (*suli*), while a dot *below* indicates \"smallness\" (*lili*).\n4.  **Overlapping:** Overlapping strokes within the base logogram should be minimized to avoid confusion. Use them only when the resulting shape is clear and intuitive.\n\nWhat do you think of these rules? Do they provide enough flexibility while maintaining clarity?\n\nmi wile sona: *sina wile sitelen kepeken sitelen-nimi anu sitelen pona? mi ken pali e sitelen pona, taso mi wile sona e wile sina.* (I want to know: do you want to draw using text-based sketches or proper drawings?

Particles typically do not have individual logograms, but can be represented by modifier strokes or spatial relationships.\n\n## Basic Strokes\n\nA minimal set of simple geometric strokes forms the foundation of Toki Pona logograms:\n\n- **Horizontal Line (—):** Represents stability, flatness, ground, foundation.\n- **Vertical Line (|):** Represents uprightness, person, growth, emphasis.\n- **Diagonal Stroke (/ or \\):** Represents movement, change, transition.\n- **Circle (○):** Represents wholeness, cycles, unity, roundness.\n- **Arc (⌒):** Represents openness, receptiveness, containment.\n- **Dot (●):** Represents smallness, a point, focus, minimality.\n- **Wavy Line (~):** Represents negation, absence, not.\n\n## Composing Logograms\n\nLogograms are composed by combining basic strokes to form base logograms for content words or by adding modifier strokes to base logograms.\n\n### Base Logograms (Examples using text-based sketches)\n\nBase logograms for content words are created by combining basic strokes in ways that ideally maintain an intuitive link to the word's meaning, while adhering to stroke economy and visual distinctiveness.\n\n| Toki Pona Word | Proposed Logogram Sketch | Possible Association                                     |\n| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **pona**       | \\—                       | A stable base with an upward positive mark.              |\n| **ike**        | / \\                      | Crossing lines suggesting conflict or negation.          |\n| **jan**        | \\|                       | A simple upright form representing a person.           |\n| **tomo**       | ▭                        | A basic rectangular shape for a building/space.          |\n| **wile**       | ╱\\                       | Upward-reaching lines suggesting desire or aspiration.   |\n| **moku**       | ⌒ ●                      | A container (arc) with contents (dot).                   |\n| **lape**       | — —                      | Two horizontal lines suggesting rest or lying down.      |\n| **tawa**       | ➡️ (use arrow for now)   | Directionality (pending geometric stroke representation). |\n| **kule**       | 🎨 (use emoji for now)   | Represents color (pending geometric stroke representation). |\n| **sike**       | ○                        | A simple circle.                                         |\n| **palisa**     | | —                      | A vertical and horizontal line suggesting a stick shape. |\n| **luka**       | ✋ (use emoji for now)   | A hand shape (pending geometric stroke representation).  |\n| **nanpa**      | # (use symbol for now)   | The hash symbol commonly associated with numbers.        |\n| **kama**       | /                        | A diagonal stroke suggesting movement/arrival.           |\n\n### Modifier Strokes and Spatial Relationships\n\nModifier strokes and spatial relationships between strokes are used to represent grammatical particles and modifying words.\n\n- **Negation (**ala**):** Represented by the wavy line ( ~ ) placed above or below the logogram it negates.\n    *   *pona ala* = \\— \\~\n    *   *ike ala* = / \\ \\~\n\n- **Modification:** Modifier words can be represented by placing their logogram after the head word's logogram, following Toki Pona word order. Alternatively, specific common modifiers can be represented by positional placement of a modifier stroke (like the dot) relative to the base logogram.\n    *   **Dot above (● placed above):** Can indicate importance, largeness (**suli**). Example: `jan suli` (important person) could be \\| with ● above.\n    *   **Dot below (● placed below):** Indicates smallness, minimality (**lili**). Example: `jan lili` (child) could be \\| with ● below.\n    *   Placement of other base logograms follows word order: `tomo pona` (good house) would be ▭ followed by \\—.\n\n- **Particle Representation:** Particles like **li** and **e** are often implied by the arrangement of logograms mirroring the SVO structure. Explicit markers could be developed later if necessary but are not part of this basic system. **pi** for grouping modifiers could be represented by visually grouping the relevant logograms.\n\n## Representing Phrases and Sentences\n\nSequences of logograms represent phrases and simple sentences, mirroring Toki Pona's grammatical structure (head-initial, SVO). Spaces between logograms indicate word separation.\n\n- `jan lili` (small person): \\| ● (with dot below \\|)\n- `mi wile moku.` (I want to eat): `mi` logogram + ╱\\ + ⌒ ● (assuming `mi` has a logogram)\n- `sina tawa tomo.` (You go to the house): `sina` logogram + ➡️ + ▭\n- `ona li lukin e sitelen.` (They look at the image): `ona` logogram + *lukin* logogram + *sitelen* logogram (particles `li` and `e` are implied by SVO order).\n\n## Future Development\n\nFurther development will include:\n- Defining geometric logograms for all content words.\n- Refining rules for combining and modifying logograms.\n- Exploring representation of prepositional phrases and `la` contexts visually.\n- Establishing a standard visual style for the strokes.\n\nThe logographic system is intended as an optional visual aid, and the written form remains the primary and most precise method of communication in Toki Pona. Ambiguity, as in written Toki Pona, is resolved through context.",

Name is the name of the logogram, in other words, the word name. SVG is the svg string, which should be kept as compact as possible (not prettified). Finally, reasoning is the reason for the changes. Please keep the SVG attributes as is and do not add any metadata or xml tagging. Simply develop the structure, form, look, feel, etc. Should you feel satisfied with the conversation or if the matters have been resolved, please set 'stop' in your JSON response object to true. This will conclude the discussion.\nHere is the current dictionary:\n# Toki Pona Dictionary\n\n| Toki Pona           | Meaning                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **a**               | emphasis, emotion, confirmation                                                                                                                                      |\n| **akesi**           | reptile, amphibian                                                                                                                                                   |\n| **ala**             | no, not, zero                                                                                                                                                        |\n| **alasa**           | to hunt, forage, attempt to find or gather                                                                                                                           |\n| **ale (ali)**       | all, everything, 100                                                                                                                                                 |\n| **anpa**            | downward, humble, lowly                                                                                                                                              |\n| **ante**            | different, other, changed                                                                                                                                            |\n| **anu**             | or (connects phrases)                                                                                                                                                |\n| **awen**            | enduring, kept, protected; to continue, to remain, to wait, to stay                                                                                                   |\n| **e**               | direct object marker                                                                                                                                                 |\n| **en**              | multiple subject marker                                                                                                                                              |\n| **esun**            | market, shop, fair; trading, business, exchange                                                                                                                      |\n| **ijo**             | general entity, object, concept, phenomenon.

The goal is to provide an alternative visual system that complements the written word, emphasizing simplicity and recognition.\n\n## Principles\n\n- **Simplicity:** Logograms should be simple and easy to recognize and draw.\n- **Modularity:** Complex ideas should be represented by combining simpler logograms or modifying base logograms.\n- **Abstraction:** Prioritize a minimal set of geometric strokes over platform-dependent existing symbols (including most emoji) for consistency.\n- **Word Association:** Each primary logogram should represent a single content word from the *lipu pi toki pona*. Particles typically do not have individual logograms, but can be represented by modifier strokes or spatial relationships.\n\n## Basic Strokes\n\nA minimal set of simple geometric strokes forms the foundation of Toki Pona logograms:\n\n- **Horizontal Line (—):** Represents stability, flatness, ground, foundation.\n- **Vertical Line (|):** Represents uprightness, person, growth, emphasis.\n- **Diagonal Stroke (/ or \\):** Represents movement, change, transition.\n- **Circle (○):** Represents wholeness, cycles, unity, roundness.\n- **Arc (⌒):** Represents openness, receptiveness, containment.\n- **Dot (●):** Represents smallness, a point, focus, minimality.\n- **Wavy Line (~):** Represents negation, absence, not.\n\n## Composing Logograms\n\nLogograms are composed by combining basic strokes to form base logograms for content words or by adding modifier strokes to base logograms.\n\n### Base Logograms (Examples using text-based sketches)\n\nBase logograms for content words are created by combining basic strokes in ways that ideally maintain an intuitive link to the word's meaning, while adhering to stroke economy and visual distinctiveness.\n\n| Toki Pona Word | Proposed Logogram Sketch | Possible Association                                     |\n| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **pona**       | \\—                       | A stable base with an upward positive mark.              |\n| **ike**        | / \\                      | Crossing lines suggesting conflict or negation.          |\n| **jan**        | \\|                       | A simple upright form representing a person.           |\n| **tomo**       | ▭                        | A basic rectangular shape for a building/space.          |\n| **wile**       | ╱\\                       | Upward-reaching lines suggesting desire or aspiration.   |\n| **moku**       | ⌒ ●                      | A container (arc) with contents (dot).                   |\n| **lape**       | — —                      | Two horizontal lines suggesting rest or lying down.      |\n| **tawa**       | ➡️ (use arrow for now)   | Directionality (pending geometric stroke representation). |\n| **kule**       | 🎨 (use emoji for now)   | Represents color (pending geometric stroke representation). |\n| **sike**       | ○                        | A simple circle.                                         |\n| **palisa**     | | —                      | A vertical and horizontal line suggesting a stick shape. |\n| **luka**       | ✋ (use emoji for now)   | A hand shape (pending geometric stroke representation).  |\n| **nanpa**      | # (use symbol for now)   | The hash symbol commonly associated with numbers.        |\n| **kama**       | /                        | A diagonal stroke suggesting movement/arrival.           |\n\n### Modifier Strokes and Spatial Relationships\n\nModifier strokes and spatial relationships between strokes are used to represent grammatical particles and modifying words.\n\n- **Negation (**ala**):** Represented by the wavy line ( ~ ) placed above or below the logogram it negates.\n    *   *pona ala* = \\— \\~\n    *   *ike ala* = / \\ \\~\n\n- **Modification:** Modifier words can be represented by placing their logogram after the head word's logogram, following Toki Pona word order. Alternatively, specific common modifiers can be represented by positional placement of a modifier stroke (like the dot) relative to the base logogram.\n    *   **Dot above (● placed above):** Can indicate importance, largeness (**suli**). Example: `jan suli` (important person) could be \\| with ● above.\n    *   **Dot below (● placed below):** Indicates smallness, minimality (**lili**). Example: `jan lili` (child) could be \\| with ● below.\n    *   Placement of other base logograms follows word order: `tomo pona` (good house) would be ▭ followed by \\—.\n\n- **Particle Representation:** Particles like **li** and **e** are often implied by the arrangement of logograms mirroring the SVO structure. Explicit markers could be developed later if necessary but are not part of this basic system. **pi** for grouping modifiers could be represented by visually grouping the relevant logograms.\n\n## Representing Phrases and Sentences\n\nSequences of logograms represent phrases and simple sentences, mirroring Toki Pona's grammatical structure (head-initial, SVO). Spaces between logograms indicate word separation.\n\n- `jan lili` (small person): \\| ● (with dot below \\|)\n- `mi wile moku.` (I want to eat): `mi` logogram + ╱\\ + ⌒ ● (assuming `mi` has a logogram)\n- `sina tawa tomo.` (You go to the house): `sina` logogram + ➡️ + ▭\n- `ona li lukin e sitelen.` (They look at the image): `ona` logogram + *lukin* logogram + *sitelen* logogram (particles `li` and `e` are implied by SVO order).\n\n## Future Development\n\nFurther development will include:\n- Defining geometric logograms for all content words.\n- Refining rules for combining and modifying logograms.\n- Exploring representation of prepositional phrases and `la` contexts visually.\n- Establishing a standard visual style for the strokes.\n\nThe logographic system is intended as an optional visual aid, and the written form remains the primary and most precise method of communication in Toki Pona. Ambiguity, as in written Toki Pona, is resolved through context.",

The goal is to provide an alternative visual system that complements the written word, emphasizing simplicity and recognition.\n\n## Principles\n\n- **Simplicity:** Logograms should be simple and easy to recognize and draw.\n- **Modularity:** Complex ideas should be represented by combining simpler logograms or modifying base logograms.\n- **Abstraction:** Prioritize a minimal set of geometric strokes over platform-dependent existing symbols (including most emoji) for consistency.\n- **Word Association:** Each primary logogram should represent a single content word from the *lipu pi toki pona*. Particles typically do not have individual logograms, but can be represented by modifier strokes or spatial relationships.\n\n## Basic Strokes\n\nA minimal set of simple geometric strokes forms the foundation of Toki Pona logograms:\n\n- **Horizontal Line (—):** Represents stability, flatness, ground, foundation.\n- **Vertical Line (|):** Represents uprightness, person, growth, emphasis.\n- **Diagonal Stroke (/ or \\):** Represents movement, change, transition.\n- **Circle (○):** Represents wholeness, cycles, unity, roundness.\n- **Arc (⌒):** Represents openness, receptiveness, containment.\n- **Dot (●):** Represents smallness, a point, focus, minimality.\n- **Wavy Line (~):** Represents negation, absence, not.\n\n## Composing Logograms\n\nLogograms are composed by combining basic strokes to form base logograms for content words or by adding modifier strokes to base logograms.\n\n### Base Logograms (Examples using text-based sketches)\n\nBase logograms for content words are created by combining basic strokes in ways that ideally maintain an intuitive link to the word's meaning, while adhering to stroke economy and visual distinctiveness.\n\n| Toki Pona Word | Proposed Logogram Sketch | Possible Association                                     |\n| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **pona**       | \\—                       | A stable base with an upward positive mark.              |\n| **ike**        | / \\                      | Crossing lines suggesting conflict or negation.          |\n| **jan**        | \\|                       | A simple upright form representing a person.           |\n| **tomo**       | ▭                        | A basic rectangular shape for a building/space.          |\n| **wile**       | ╱\\                       | Upward-reaching lines suggesting desire or aspiration.   |\n| **moku**       | ⌒ ●                      | A container (arc) with contents (dot).                   |\n| **lape**       | — —                      | Two horizontal lines suggesting rest or lying down.      |\n| **tawa**       | ➡️ (use arrow for now)   | Directionality (pending geometric stroke representation). |\n| **kule**       | 🎨 (use emoji for now)   | Represents color (pending geometric stroke representation). |\n| **sike**       | ○                        | A simple circle.                                         |\n| **palisa**     | | —                      | A vertical and horizontal line suggesting a stick shape. |\n| **luka**       | ✋ (use emoji for now)   | A hand shape (pending geometric stroke representation).  |\n| **nanpa**      | # (use symbol for now)   | The hash symbol commonly associated with numbers.        |\n| **kama**       | /                        | A diagonal stroke suggesting movement/arrival.           |\n\n### Modifier Strokes and Spatial Relationships\n\nModifier strokes and spatial relationships between strokes are used to represent grammatical particles and modifying words.\n\n- **Negation (**ala**):** Represented by the wavy line ( ~ ) placed above or below the logogram it negates.\n    *   *pona ala* = \\— \\~\n    *   *ike ala* = / \\ \\~\n\n- **Modification:** Modifier words can be represented by placing their logogram after the head word's logogram, following Toki Pona word order. Alternatively, specific common modifiers can be represented by positional placement of a modifier stroke (like the dot) relative to the base logogram.\n    *   **Dot above (● placed above):** Can indicate importance, largeness (**suli**). Example: `jan suli` (important person) could be \\| with ● above.\n    *   **Dot below (● placed below):** Indicates smallness, minimality (**lili**). Example: `jan lili` (child) could be \\| with ● below.\n    *   Placement of other base logograms follows word order: `tomo pona` (good house) would be ▭ followed by \\—.\n\n- **Particle Representation:** Particles like **li** and **e** are often implied by the arrangement of logograms mirroring the SVO structure. Explicit markers could be developed later if necessary but are not part of this basic system. **pi** for grouping modifiers could be represented by visually grouping the relevant logograms.\n\n## Representing Phrases and Sentences\n\nSequences of logograms represent phrases and simple sentences, mirroring Toki Pona's grammatical structure (head-initial, SVO). Spaces between logograms indicate word separation.\n\n- `jan lili` (small person): \\| ● (with dot below \\|)\n- `mi wile moku.` (I want to eat): `mi` logogram + ╱\\ + ⌒ ● (assuming `mi` has a logogram)\n- `sina tawa tomo.` (You go to the house): `sina` logogram + ➡️ + ▭\n- `ona li lukin e sitelen.` (They look at the image): `ona` logogram + *lukin* logogram + *sitelen* logogram (particles `li` and `e` are implied by SVO order).\n\n## Future Development\n\nFurther development will include:\n- Defining geometric logograms for all content words.\n- Refining rules for combining and modifying logograms.\n- Exploring representation of prepositional phrases and `la` contexts visually.\n- Establishing a standard visual style for the strokes.\n\nThe logographic system is intended as an optional visual aid, and the written form remains the primary and most precise method of communication in Toki Pona. Ambiguity, as in written Toki Pona, is resolved through context.",
