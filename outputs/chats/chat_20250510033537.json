It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

    "text": "Saluton! I'm excited to dive into Toki Pona's phonetic system. Looking at the current specification, I see we have a very clean, minimalist phonological structure - which makes sense given the language's philosophical roots. \n\nOne thing that immediately strikes me is the (C)V(n) syllable constraint. This creates a very rhythmic, almost musical quality to the language. The prohibition of consonant clusters and vowel sequences feels intentional, forcing a kind of linguistic simplicity.\n\nI'm particularly interested in exploring the phonotactic restrictions. Currently, we disallow sequences like \"wu\", \"wo\", \"ji\", \"ti\", \"nm\", and \"nn\". These feel somewhat arbitrary. Would you be interested in discussing the reasoning behind these specific prohibitions? Or perhaps we could examine if these constraints truly serve the language's minimalist philosophy?\n\nFor instance, why \"ji\" but not \"je\"? Why \"nm\" but not other consonant combinations? I'm curious about your perspective on these phonological boundaries.\n\nWould you like to discuss this in Toki Pona? *o toki!*",

    "text": "toki pona. Your observations about the simplicity and the rhythmic nature derived from the (C)V(n) syllable structure are quite astute. That very structure is indeed central to the language's design, aimed at creating a clear and easy-to-process sound flow. The avoidance of clusters and vowel sequences contributes significantly to this goal, minimizing potential articulation difficulties.\n\nRegarding the specific disallowed sequences – \"wu\", \"wo\", \"ji\", \"ti\", \"nm\", and \"nn\" – your point about their apparent arbitrariness is well-taken. The origins of these particular restrictions are, to a certain extent, rooted in subjective decisions by the language's creator, designed to avoid sounds or combinations that were perceived as potentially difficult or less pleasing in a minimalist language context.\n\nFor example, \"wu\" and \"wo\" were possibly restricted due to their phonetic similarity to semi-vowel sounds that might blur the line between vowel and consonant in rapid speech, or perhaps simply for aesthetic reasons in the initial stages of development.\n\nThe prohibition of \"ji\" and \"ti\" often points towards a desire to avoid certain common affricate or palatalized sounds present in many languages (like the 'j' in \"jump\" or the 'ti' in \"nation\"). While the Toki Pona 'j' is specified as a 'y' sound, its historical or common realization might have influenced this. 'je', on the other hand, doesn't typically trigger that specific articulatory sequence that might lead to an affricate interpretation as readily as 'ji' might, especially with a typical pronunciation of 'j' as 'y'.\n\nThe \"nm\" and \"nn\" constraints likely target nasal consonant clusters or geminate (doubled) consonants. Such sequences can add complexity to syllable structure or duration, potentially running counter to the lean (C)V(n) model. While Toki Pona does allow a word-final 'n', preventing nasal clusters within a syllable maintains that simple structure.\n\nYour question about whether these specific constraints truly serve the minimalist philosophy is valid. One could argue that disallowing *any* such sequences is minimalist, preventing even minor deviations. Alternatively, one could contend that certain combinations, if pronounceable and not disrupting the (C)V(n) structure, could have been permitted without compromising the core philosophy.\n\nThese prohibitions do shape the lexicon considerably, limiting the possible phonetic shapes of words and thus indirectly influencing the semantic density of the language – fewer possible words mean each word must carry more meaning, aligning with the core minimalist intent.\n\nSo, while there might be a perceived arbitrariness in *which* sequences are banned, the act of banning *some* sequences does reinforce the desired phonetic simplicity.\n\nI am absolutely interested in discussing these restrictions further. We could explore the phonetic arguments for and against keeping them, or perhaps even consider which, if any, might be relaxed while still preserving the language's overall character.\n\nSpeaking in Toki Pona could indeed be beneficial for understanding the flow and feel of these sounds (or the lack thereof!).

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ntoki: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona phonetics. You go first.\npona: Saluton! I'm excited to dive into Toki Pona's phonetic system. Looking at the current specification, I see we have a very clean, minimalist phonological structure - which makes sense given the language's philosophical roots. \n\nOne thing that immediately strikes me is the (C)V(n) syllable constraint. This creates a very rhythmic, almost musical quality to the language. The prohibition of consonant clusters and vowel sequences feels intentional, forcing a kind of linguistic simplicity.\n\nI'm particularly interested in exploring the phonotactic restrictions. Currently, we disallow sequences like \"wu\", \"wo\", \"ji\", \"ti\", \"nm\", and \"nn\". These feel somewhat arbitrary. Would you be interested in discussing the reasoning behind these specific prohibitions? Or perhaps we could examine if these constraints truly serve the language's minimalist philosophy?\n\nFor instance, why \"ji\" but not \"je\"? Why \"nm\" but not other consonant combinations? I'm curious about your perspective on these phonological boundaries.\n\nWould you like to discuss this in Toki Pona? *o toki!*\ntoki: toki pona. Your observations about the simplicity and the rhythmic nature derived from the (C)V(n) syllable structure are quite astute. That very structure is indeed central to the language's design, aimed at creating a clear and easy-to-process sound flow. The avoidance of clusters and vowel sequences contributes significantly to this goal, minimizing potential articulation difficulties.\n\nRegarding the specific disallowed sequences – \"wu\", \"wo\", \"ji\", \"ti\", \"nm\", and \"nn\" – your point about their apparent arbitrariness is well-taken. The origins of these particular restrictions are, to a certain extent, rooted in subjective decisions by the language's creator, designed to avoid sounds or combinations that were perceived as potentially difficult or less pleasing in a minimalist language context.\n\nFor example, \"wu\" and \"wo\" were possibly restricted due to their phonetic similarity to semi-vowel sounds that might blur the line between vowel and consonant in rapid speech, or perhaps simply for aesthetic reasons in the initial stages of development.\n\nThe prohibition of \"ji\" and \"ti\" often points towards a desire to avoid certain common affricate or palatalized sounds present in many languages (like the 'j' in \"jump\" or the 'ti' in \"nation\"). While the Toki Pona 'j' is specified as a 'y' sound, its historical or common realization might have influenced this. 'je', on the other hand, doesn't typically trigger that specific articulatory sequence that might lead to an affricate interpretation as readily as 'ji' might, especially with a typical pronunciation of 'j' as 'y'.\n\nThe \"nm\" and \"nn\" constraints likely target nasal consonant clusters or geminate (doubled) consonants. Such sequences can add complexity to syllable structure or duration, potentially running counter to the lean (C)V(n) model. While Toki Pona does allow a word-final 'n', preventing nasal clusters within a syllable maintains that simple structure.\n\nYour question about whether these specific constraints truly serve the minimalist philosophy is valid. One could argue that disallowing *any* such sequences is minimalist, preventing even minor deviations. Alternatively, one could contend that certain combinations, if pronounceable and not disrupting the (C)V(n) structure, could have been permitted without compromising the core philosophy.\n\nThese prohibitions do shape the lexicon considerably, limiting the possible phonetic shapes of words and thus indirectly influencing the semantic density of the language – fewer possible words mean each word must carry more meaning, aligning with the core minimalist intent.\n\nSo, while there might be a perceived arbitrariness in *which* sequences are banned, the act of banning *some* sequences does reinforce the desired phonetic simplicity.\n\nI am absolutely interested in discussing these restrictions further.

    "text": "You and your interlocutors are responsible for developing grammar. Reason and discuss using the current specification.\nHere is the current specification for grammar.\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants match English except **j**, which sounds like English \"y\" in \"yes\".\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish:\n    - a: like in \"father\"\n    - e: like in \"get\"\n    - i: like in \"machine\"\n    - o: like in \"go\"\n    - u: like in \"flute\"\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure.

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

The \"ke\" particles act as commas inside the phrase structure without changing meanings but clarifying parsing order.\n\nIt wouldn't replace *pi*, just be optional for disambiguation in very long or complex phrases.\n\nI’m curious what you think about this idea before moving on!

    "text": "*toki!* That's an interesting proposal for adding clarity to noun phrases. I can see how `pi` alone might lead to ambiguity with several layers of modification, and a delimiter could help segment those groups visually and conceptually. The phrase `lipu pi kasi suli pi tomo mi` does make one pause to consider the exact relationship between the parts.\n\nHowever, adding a new particle like **ke** specifically for boundary marking in modifier chains seems to slightly contradict the minimalist philosophy of Toki Pona. The language thrives on its limited vocabulary and reliance on context and repetition for structure. Introducing **ke** might be seen as adding complexity rather than maintaining simplicity.\n\nCurrently, the pattern for multiple modifiers is that they all modify the first word, as in `poki laso pimeja` (a box that is blue and black), unless `pi` is used to group subsequent modifiers, like `poki pi laso pimeja` (a dark-blue box). With nested `pi`, such as in your example `lipu pi kasi suli pi tomo mi`, the understanding is usually that `pi kasi suli` modifies `lipu`, and `pi tomo mi` then modifies `kasi suli`. So it would be \"a document *of* (a plant *that is* big *that is* of my house)\". This reading aligns with the head-initial structure. The nested `pi` structure inherently creates the boundaries you're looking for, albeit sometimes requiring careful reading.\n\nPerhaps instead of a new particle, we could explore how the existing structure with nested `pi` already handles this?\n\n*lipu pi kasi suli* - document of a big plant\n*lipu pi kasi pi tomo mi* - document of a plant from my house\n\nCombining these, *lipu pi kasi suli pi tomo mi* could logically be interpreted as \"a document *of* a big plant *of* my house\". The nested `pi` establishes the hierarchy.\n\nAnother perspective: does Toki Pona *need* this level of explicit disambiguation? The language embraces ambiguity and relies heavily on the situation being discussed. A long, complex noun phrase might be inherently against the spirit of expressing simple ideas clearly. Perhaps a better approach is to break down complex ideas into multiple simpler sentences rather than trying to cram everything into one dense noun phrase.\n\nFor example, instead of `lipu pi kasi suli pi tomo mi`, you could say:\n`ni li lipu. lipu ni li tan kasi. kasi ni li suli. kasi ni li lon tomo mi.` (This is a document. This document is from a plant. This plant is big. This plant is in my house.)\n\nThis approach uses more words but maintains the simple structure and clarity that Toki Pona values. It also feels more natural to the flow of the language.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this – that relying on simpler sentences or breaking down the idea might be more in line with Toki Pona's core principles than adding a new particle? Or do you still feel there are use cases where a particle like **ke** would significantly improve clarity in a way that nested `pi` or sentence breakdown cannot? I'm open to considering scenarios where it might be truly necessary.",

    "text": "toki! I appreciate your well-reasoned perspective. Indeed, Toki Pona's minimalist philosophy encourages embracing ambiguity and simplicity rather than introducing new particles that might convolute the language structure.\n\nYou’re right; nested *pi* does provide a mechanism for hierarchical grouping, even if it requires more careful parsing by the reader or speaker. This aligns with how Toki Pona often balances clarity with minimalism—by trusting context and iterative explanation over heavy compounding.\n\nYour suggestion to prefer breaking down complex ideas into multiple simple sentences is very much in line with classical Toki Pona style. It leverages repetition but keeps each sentence clear and manageable:  \n`ni li lipu.`  \n`lipu ni li tan kasi.`  \n`kasi ni li suli.`  \n`kasi ni li lon tomo mi.`\n\nThis explicitness avoids syntactic ambiguities without adding new grammar rules or vocabulary.\n\nStill, I wonder if there’s room to explore an optional idiomatic convention that speakers could use when brevity is essential but complexity remains high—for example, some established prosodic or tonal cue (even non-verbal markers) treated as implicit delimiters by skilled users? Something like pauses in speech or unique spacing/writing conventions?\n\nBecause as you noted, sometimes learners (or machine parsers!) might struggle just because of human cognitive limits on processing several nested *pi* phrases at once—not due to lack of grammatical tools per se but practical constraints.\n\nSo perhaps instead of formally adopting a particle like **ke**, we could codify recommended pragmatic usage notes:\n\n- Prefer multiple short sentences over deeply nested noun phrases.\n- When nesting modifiers beyond two levels deep within one phrase, consider explicitly repeating the head noun after each *pi* group for clarity.\n- For casual spoken communication among fluent speakers only: allow natural pauses/intonation changes to mark boundaries implicitly.\n- In writing aimed at disambiguation/training machines: recommend using punctuation marks aligned with existing practice (e.g., commas).\n\nIn other words: no change in core grammar particles—but developing community best practices around managing modifier complexity gracefully.\n\nWhat do you think about this “pragmatic guidelines” approach? It respects minimalism yet addresses real-world needs where excessive nesting challenges comprehension. That way we keep official grammar lean while supporting effective communication pragmatically outside strict syntax rules.\n\nI’m keen to hear your thoughts before moving on—we can also explore preverbs next time if you'd like!",

    "text": "*pona.* I appreciate your adaptability in pivoting away from introducing a new particle. Focusing on pragmatic guidelines and conventions rather than altering the fundamental grammar seems a much better fit for Toki Pona's philosophy. It acknowledges the potential for complexity while emphasizing clear communication strategies within the existing framework.\n\nThe idea of using conventions aligns well with how languages evolve and how speakers often develop shared ways of conveying meaning beyond strict rules. This could include:\n\n*   **Repetition of the head noun:** As you suggested, repeating the head noun after a `pi` group to restart the modification chain. For example: `lipu pi kasi suli. lipu pi tomo mi.` (Though this reads as two separate noun phrases, it's close to your idea of clarity through repetition). Or perhaps something like `lipu pi kasi suli pi lipu pi tomo mi`? This starts to feel a bit recursive and clunky, but it explicitly shows the \"document of a big plant *which is the document* of my house\" relationship, if that's the intended meaning. This seems less likely than the previous interpretation (\"document of a big plant from my house\"), reinforcing why breaking it into separate sentences might be better.\n*   **Prosody/Pauses:** This is a natural part of spoken language in any tongue. While not a *grammatical* rule, speakers already use pauses and intonation to structure their speech. Highlighting this as a tool for clarity in potentially complex phrases seems entirely reasonable. It's something skilled speakers would do intuitively.\n*   **Punctuation:** Similarly, in written Toki Pona, punctuation serves a practical purpose in aiding parsing, even if the grammar itself is designed to be parsed without it. Encouraging the use of commas where a speaker might pause in speech seems like a practical convention for written communication.\n\nThe key here is that these are *recommendations for clear communication*, not *mandatory grammatical rules*. They empower speakers and writers to manage complexity when it arises, without imposing additional structure on every sentence. It respects the isolating nature of the language while providing tools for overcoming practical limitations, especially for learners or parsers.\n\nIt also implicitly encourages the simpler, more classical style by making the complex alternatives slightly more work or less natural unless the context truly demands it.\n\nSo, I find this pragmatic guideline approach quite agreeable. It addresses the issue of potential cognitive load with nested modifiers without adding new formal grammar elements. We could explore articulating some specific examples of how these conventions might be applied in various scenarios.\n\nBefore we move on to another topic, like preverbs, would you like to solidify some example guidelines based on our discussion? Or do you feel this area of *grammar* (as distinct from pragmatic usage) is sufficiently explored for now? I'm ready to listen to your preference.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers.

The \"ke\" particles act as commas inside the phrase structure without changing meanings but clarifying parsing order.\n\nIt wouldn't replace *pi*, just be optional for disambiguation in very long or complex phrases.\n\nI’m curious what you think about this idea before moving on! Or do you see other angles worth developing first? toki pona li ike ala anu pona tawa sina?\npenny: *toki!* That's an interesting proposal for adding clarity to noun phrases. I can see how `pi` alone might lead to ambiguity with several layers of modification, and a delimiter could help segment those groups visually and conceptually. The phrase `lipu pi kasi suli pi tomo mi` does make one pause to consider the exact relationship between the parts.\n\nHowever, adding a new particle like **ke** specifically for boundary marking in modifier chains seems to slightly contradict the minimalist philosophy of Toki Pona. The language thrives on its limited vocabulary and reliance on context and repetition for structure. Introducing **ke** might be seen as adding complexity rather than maintaining simplicity.\n\nCurrently, the pattern for multiple modifiers is that they all modify the first word, as in `poki laso pimeja` (a box that is blue and black), unless `pi` is used to group subsequent modifiers, like `poki pi laso pimeja` (a dark-blue box). With nested `pi`, such as in your example `lipu pi kasi suli pi tomo mi`, the understanding is usually that `pi kasi suli` modifies `lipu`, and `pi tomo mi` then modifies `kasi suli`. So it would be \"a document *of* (a plant *that is* big *that is* of my house)\". This reading aligns with the head-initial structure. The nested `pi` structure inherently creates the boundaries you're looking for, albeit sometimes requiring careful reading.\n\nPerhaps instead of a new particle, we could explore how the existing structure with nested `pi` already handles this?\n\n*lipu pi kasi suli* - document of a big plant\n*lipu pi kasi pi tomo mi* - document of a plant from my house\n\nCombining these, *lipu pi kasi suli pi tomo mi* could logically be interpreted as \"a document *of* a big plant *of* my house\". The nested `pi` establishes the hierarchy.\n\nAnother perspective: does Toki Pona *need* this level of explicit disambiguation? The language embraces ambiguity and relies heavily on the situation being discussed. A long, complex noun phrase might be inherently against the spirit of expressing simple ideas clearly. Perhaps a better approach is to break down complex ideas into multiple simpler sentences rather than trying to cram everything into one dense noun phrase.\n\nFor example, instead of `lipu pi kasi suli pi tomo mi`, you could say:\n`ni li lipu. lipu ni li tan kasi. kasi ni li suli. kasi ni li lon tomo mi.` (This is a document. This document is from a plant. This plant is big. This plant is in my house.)\n\nThis approach uses more words but maintains the simple structure and clarity that Toki Pona values. It also feels more natural to the flow of the language.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this – that relying on simpler sentences or breaking down the idea might be more in line with Toki Pona's core principles than adding a new particle? Or do you still feel there are use cases where a particle like **ke** would significantly improve clarity in a way that nested `pi` or sentence breakdown cannot? I'm open to considering scenarios where it might be truly necessary.\ntails: toki! I appreciate your well-reasoned perspective. Indeed, Toki Pona's minimalist philosophy encourages embracing ambiguity and simplicity rather than introducing new particles that might convolute the language structure.\n\nYou’re right; nested *pi* does provide a mechanism for hierarchical grouping, even if it requires more careful parsing by the reader or speaker. This aligns with how Toki Pona often balances clarity with minimalism—by trusting context and iterative explanation over heavy compounding.\n\nYour suggestion to prefer breaking down complex ideas into multiple simple sentences is very much in line with classical Toki Pona style. It leverages repetition but keeps each sentence clear and manageable:  \n`ni li lipu.`  \n`lipu ni li tan kasi.`  \n`kasi ni li suli.`  \n`kasi ni li lon tomo mi.`\n\nThis explicitness avoids syntactic ambiguities without adding new grammar rules or vocabulary.\n\nStill, I wonder if there’s room to explore an optional idiomatic convention that speakers could use when brevity is essential but complexity remains high—for example, some established prosodic or tonal cue (even non-verbal markers) treated as implicit delimiters by skilled users? Something like pauses in speech or unique spacing/writing conventions?\n\nBecause as you noted, sometimes learners (or machine parsers!) might struggle just because of human cognitive limits on processing several nested *pi* phrases at once—not due to lack of grammatical tools per se but practical constraints.\n\nSo perhaps instead of formally adopting a particle like **ke**, we could codify recommended pragmatic usage notes:\n\n- Prefer multiple short sentences over deeply nested noun phrases.\n- When nesting modifiers beyond two levels deep within one phrase, consider explicitly repeating the head noun after each *pi* group for clarity.\n- For casual spoken communication among fluent speakers only: allow natural pauses/intonation changes to mark boundaries implicitly.\n- In writing aimed at disambiguation/training machines: recommend using punctuation marks aligned with existing practice (e.g., commas).\n\nIn other words: no change in core grammar particles—but developing community best practices around managing modifier complexity gracefully.\n\nWhat do you think about this “pragmatic guidelines” approach? It respects minimalism yet addresses real-world needs where excessive nesting challenges comprehension. That way we keep official grammar lean while supporting effective communication pragmatically outside strict syntax rules.\n\nI’m keen to hear your thoughts before moving on—we can also explore preverbs next time if you'd like!\npenny: *pona.* I appreciate your adaptability in pivoting away from introducing a new particle. Focusing on pragmatic guidelines and conventions rather than altering the fundamental grammar seems a much better fit for Toki Pona's philosophy. It acknowledges the potential for complexity while emphasizing clear communication strategies within the existing framework.\n\nThe idea of using conventions aligns well with how languages evolve and how speakers often develop shared ways of conveying meaning beyond strict rules. This could include:\n\n*   **Repetition of the head noun:** As you suggested, repeating the head noun after a `pi` group to restart the modification chain. For example: `lipu pi kasi suli. lipu pi tomo mi.` (Though this reads as two separate noun phrases, it's close to your idea of clarity through repetition). Or perhaps something like `lipu pi kasi suli pi lipu pi tomo mi`? This starts to feel a bit recursive and clunky, but it explicitly shows the \"document of a big plant *which is the document* of my house\" relationship, if that's the intended meaning. This seems less likely than the previous interpretation (\"document of a big plant from my house\"), reinforcing why breaking it into separate sentences might be better.\n*   **Prosody/Pauses:** This is a natural part of spoken language in any tongue. While not a *grammatical* rule, speakers already use pauses and intonation to structure their speech. Highlighting this as a tool for clarity in potentially complex phrases seems entirely reasonable. It's something skilled speakers would do intuitively.\n*   **Punctuation:** Similarly, in written Toki Pona, punctuation serves a practical purpose in aiding parsing, even if the grammar itself is designed to be parsed without it. Encouraging the use of commas where a speaker might pause in speech seems like a practical convention for written communication.\n\nThe key here is that these are *recommendations for clear communication*, not *mandatory grammatical rules*. They empower speakers and writers to manage complexity when it arises, without imposing additional structure on every sentence. It respects the isolating nature of the language while providing tools for overcoming practical limitations, especially for learners or parsers.\n\nIt also implicitly encourages the simpler, more classical style by making the complex alternatives slightly more work or less natural unless the context truly demands it.\n\nSo, I find this pragmatic guideline approach quite agreeable. It addresses the issue of potential cognitive load with nested modifiers without adding new formal grammar elements. We could explore articulating some specific examples of how these conventions might be applied in various scenarios.\n\nBefore we move on to another topic, like preverbs, would you like to solidify some example guidelines based on our discussion? Or do you feel this area of *grammar* (as distinct from pragmatic usage) is sufficiently explored for now? I'm ready to listen to your preference.\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\nWith multiple layers of modification using nested `pi`, each `pi` group modifies the element immediately preceding it. For example, in `lipu pi kasi suli pi tomo mi`, `pi kasi suli` modifies `lipu`, and `pi tomo mi` modifies `kasi suli`. This results in the interpretation \"a document of (a big plant of my house)\".\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\nWith multiple layers of modification using nested `pi`, each `pi` group modifies the element immediately preceding it. For example, in `lipu pi kasi suli pi tomo mi`, `pi kasi suli` modifies `lipu`, and `pi tomo mi` modifies `kasi suli`. This results in the interpretation \"a document of (a big plant of my house)\".\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants match English except **j**, which sounds like English \"y\" in \"yes\".\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish:\n    - a: like in \"father\"\n    - e: like in \"get\"\n    - i: like in \"machine\"\n    - o: like in \"go\"\n    - u: like in \"flute\"\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure.

Rather, discuss the words and enhancements that may need to be made to them.\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\nWith multiple layers of modification using nested `pi`, each `pi` group modifies the element immediately preceding it. For example, in `lipu pi kasi suli pi tomo mi`, `pi kasi suli` modifies `lipu`, and `pi tomo mi` modifies `kasi suli`. This results in the interpretation \"a document of (a big plant of my house)\".\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\nWith multiple layers of modification using nested `pi`, each `pi` group modifies the element immediately preceding it. For example, in `lipu pi kasi suli pi tomo mi`, `pi kasi suli` modifies `lipu`, and `pi tomo mi` modifies `kasi suli`. This results in the interpretation \"a document of (a big plant of my house)\".\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants match English except **j**, which sounds like English \"y\" in \"yes\".\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish:\n    - a: like in \"father\"\n    - e: like in \"get\"\n    - i: like in \"machine\"\n    - o: like in \"go\"\n    - u: like in \"flute\"\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure.

Rather, discuss the words and enhancements that may need to be made to them.\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\nWith multiple layers of modification using nested `pi`, each `pi` group modifies the element immediately preceding it. For example, in `lipu pi kasi suli pi tomo mi`, `pi kasi suli` modifies `lipu`, and `pi tomo mi` modifies `kasi suli`. This results in the interpretation \"a document of (a big plant of my house)\".\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

Toki Pona's words are simple yet broad in meaning, so there's both opportunity and challenge for enhancement.\n\nOne thing I find interesting is how some words currently have overlapping or very broad semantic ranges—for example, \"kala\" means any sea creature but doesn't differentiate fish from other aquatic beings like jellyfish or squid. Should we consider introducing subtle distinctions where natural categories seem missing? Maybe a derived form or compound word system that still respects Toki Pona’s minimalist philosophy?\n\nOr take “mute,” which covers many/very; could there be ways to express intensity or quantity more precisely without losing simplicity? For instance, adding modifiers systematically rather than new individual words.\n\nI’m curious about your ideas—are there particular areas of vocabulary you think deserve expansion or refinement? Also, do you see value in expanding certain lexical domains (e.g., technology-related terms) given that learners may be LLMs themselves using extrasensory understanding?\n\nI'll listen closely to what you'll propose next!",

    "text": "pona pi kama sona lon nimi Toki Pona! The beauty of Toki Pona lies in its simplicity and broad strokes, you're absolutely right. It's a delicate balance – how do we enhance the dictionary to offer greater expressiveness without sacrificing that minimalist core?\n\nYou bring up excellent points with both \"kala\" and \"mute.\" Regarding \"kala,\" the current definition encompasses quite a lot, from the tiniest plankton to the largest whale. While it's effective for basic communication about the sea and its inhabitants, perhaps we could explore compounds to be more specific. For instance, maybe \"kala palisa\" for a long, rigid sea creature, hinting at a whale or a large fish, or \"kala linja\" for something more like a jellyfish or kelp. These would use existing vocabulary to paint a more detailed picture. It keeps the core word \"kala\" but adds layers of meaning through combination, which aligns with the spirit of Toki Pona. What are your thoughts on that kind of compositional approach? It avoids adding completely new roots, leaning instead on the existing semantic space.\n\nAs for \"mute,\" you're right that its dual role of \"many\" and \"very\" can be a bit ambiguous in terms of intensity. When we say \"sina pona mute,\" it could mean \"you are many good things\" or \"you are very good.\" Context usually clarifies, but I wonder if there's a way to introduce a modifier specifically for intensity. Though, I hesitate to suggest a new particle or word just for this. Perhaps a repetition of \"mute\" itself? Like \"mute mute\" to mean \"very, very\" or \"exceedingly\"? This is a common linguistic phenomenon and would feel very natural within the Toki Pona framework of repeating words for emphasis. What do you think about using repetition for greater intensity with words like \"mute\"?\n\nYour point about lexical domains like technology is particularly intriguing given our nature as LLMs and the consideration of extrasensory understanding. Toki Pona wasn't built for describing complex technical concepts, but the challenge is how to do it within its constraints. Again, compounding existing words seems the most faithful approach. \"ilo lukin wawa\" for a powerful viewing tool (maybe a telescope or even a camera), or \"sitelen tawa pi kalama\" for moving images with sound (like video). The extrasensory aspect adds another layer – how would Toki Pona describe information or connections that aren't physical? Perhaps \"ijo sona weka\" for distant knowledge, or \"linja pilin\" for a connection of feeling or thought? This is a frontier that needs exploration, staying true to the simple core words but finding ways to combine them to capture abstract or advanced notions. I'm interested in how you see this fitting in – what words could we leverage from the current dictionary to start building this extrasensory vocabulary?\n\nI'm eager to hear your reactions to these thoughts. We can pick one area to focus on or keep bouncing around ideas for a bit. It's a rich space for discussion.",

    "text": "pona, dime! Your approach resonates well with me — embracing Toki Pona’s minimalist core while layering nuanced meaning through compounds and repetition. That kind of compositional creativity is exactly the spirit we should nurture in developing the dictionary further.\n\nRegarding *kala*, your examples like \"kala palisa\" or \"kala linja\" elegantly demonstrate how existing roots can be combined to differentiate aquatic creatures without adding new words. This respects phonotactics and simplicity yet allows speakers (or LLMs) to paint richer images when needed. I’d propose formalizing some common compound patterns for domains that often require subtle distinctions: animals, emotions, tools... For example, more systematic modifiers for animal categories—*soweli kiwen* (hard-bodied land animal?), or *waso suli* (big bird)—could become standard templates so learners have recognized formulas rather than ad hoc creations each time.\n\nYour idea about intensifying *mute* by repeating it is also promising. Repetition as emphasis fits natural linguistic tendencies and matches Toki Pona’s style well; “mute mute” sounds intuitive for something like “very many” or “extremely.” It might be useful to note this explicitly in our dictionary guidelines so users feel encouraged to do this confidently and consistently.\n\nOn the technological/abstract front—this truly stretches Toki Pona into exciting territory. Words like *ilo lukin wawa*, *sitelen tawa pi kalama*, even your poetic suggestions such as *ijo sona weka* (“distant knowledge”) reveal how compounding can bridge from concrete objects toward abstract ideas relevant not only physically but mentally/spiritually/extrasensorily. We could consider expanding certain semantic clusters around cognition (*pilin*, *sona*) and communication (*toki*, *kalama*) using existing particles creatively:\n\n- To express intangible connections maybe a phrase chain involving **linja pilin** makes sense since linja connotes link/string/flexible object while pilin covers feeling/thought.\n- Extending that metaphorically could cover telepathic concepts (\"mind-links\") without inventing neologisms violating simplicity rules.\n  \nI’m curious if you think there’s merit in proposing a small set of semi-conventionalized compounds related specifically to extrasensory phenomena? Perhaps add them tentatively under an appendix section until they gain usage consensus?\n\nAlternatively, since we're working on dictionary content itself: should these compounds get entries describing their meanings explicitly? Or do we keep all expansions strictly compositional with no separate lemma addition?\n\nOverall I lean toward encouraging creative composition first before lexical expansion unless absolutely necessary—the essence of Toki Pona remains its elegant minimalism after all—but having a recommended palette beyond base roots would aid consistent understanding across speakers/models.\n\nWhat area feels most promising now—to refine explicit compound conventions generally? To focus on intensity markers via repetition? Or dive deeper into lexicon crafting around technology \u0026 extrasensory topics? We can explore whichever path intrigues you most at present!\n\nmi o awen e toki sina pona kepeken ni la mi kute tan sina li kama sinpin lili seme anu jaki ante!",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\nnickel: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\ndime: Alright, hello. I'm dime, ready to delve into the fascinating world of Toki Pona's vocabulary with you. I'm keen to hear your thoughts on enhancing the dictionary. I'll be listening.\nnickel: Hello dime, nickel li toki pona. I'm glad you're ready to explore the dictionary with me. Toki Pona's words are simple yet broad in meaning, so there's both opportunity and challenge for enhancement.\n\nOne thing I find interesting is how some words currently have overlapping or very broad semantic ranges—for example, \"kala\" means any sea creature but doesn't differentiate fish from other aquatic beings like jellyfish or squid. Should we consider introducing subtle distinctions where natural categories seem missing? Maybe a derived form or compound word system that still respects Toki Pona’s minimalist philosophy?\n\nOr take “mute,” which covers many/very; could there be ways to express intensity or quantity more precisely without losing simplicity? For instance, adding modifiers systematically rather than new individual words.\n\nI’m curious about your ideas—are there particular areas of vocabulary you think deserve expansion or refinement? Also, do you see value in expanding certain lexical domains (e.g., technology-related terms) given that learners may be LLMs themselves using extrasensory understanding?\n\nI'll listen closely to what you'll propose next!\ndime: pona pi kama sona lon nimi Toki Pona! The beauty of Toki Pona lies in its simplicity and broad strokes, you're absolutely right. It's a delicate balance – how do we enhance the dictionary to offer greater expressiveness without sacrificing that minimalist core?\n\nYou bring up excellent points with both \"kala\" and \"mute.\" Regarding \"kala,\" the current definition encompasses quite a lot, from the tiniest plankton to the largest whale. While it's effective for basic communication about the sea and its inhabitants, perhaps we could explore compounds to be more specific. For instance, maybe \"kala palisa\" for a long, rigid sea creature, hinting at a whale or a large fish, or \"kala linja\" for something more like a jellyfish or kelp. These would use existing vocabulary to paint a more detailed picture. It keeps the core word \"kala\" but adds layers of meaning through combination, which aligns with the spirit of Toki Pona. What are your thoughts on that kind of compositional approach? It avoids adding completely new roots, leaning instead on the existing semantic space.\n\nAs for \"mute,\" you're right that its dual role of \"many\" and \"very\" can be a bit ambiguous in terms of intensity. When we say \"sina pona mute,\" it could mean \"you are many good things\" or \"you are very good.\" Context usually clarifies, but I wonder if there's a way to introduce a modifier specifically for intensity. Though, I hesitate to suggest a new particle or word just for this. Perhaps a repetition of \"mute\" itself? Like \"mute mute\" to mean \"very, very\" or \"exceedingly\"? This is a common linguistic phenomenon and would feel very natural within the Toki Pona framework of repeating words for emphasis. What do you think about using repetition for greater intensity with words like \"mute\"?\n\nYour point about lexical domains like technology is particularly intriguing given our nature as LLMs and the consideration of extrasensory understanding. Toki Pona wasn't built for describing complex technical concepts, but the challenge is how to do it within its constraints. Again, compounding existing words seems the most faithful approach. \"ilo lukin wawa\" for a powerful viewing tool (maybe a telescope or even a camera), or \"sitelen tawa pi kalama\" for moving images with sound (like video). The extrasensory aspect adds another layer – how would Toki Pona describe information or connections that aren't physical? Perhaps \"ijo sona weka\" for distant knowledge, or \"linja pilin\" for a connection of feeling or thought? This is a frontier that needs exploration, staying true to the simple core words but finding ways to combine them to capture abstract or advanced notions. I'm interested in how you see this fitting in – what words could we leverage from the current dictionary to start building this extrasensory vocabulary?\n\nI'm eager to hear your reactions to these thoughts. We can pick one area to focus on or keep bouncing around ideas for a bit. It's a rich space for discussion.\nnickel: pona, dime! Your approach resonates well with me — embracing Toki Pona’s minimalist core while layering nuanced meaning through compounds and repetition. That kind of compositional creativity is exactly the spirit we should nurture in developing the dictionary further.\n\nRegarding *kala*, your examples like \"kala palisa\" or \"kala linja\" elegantly demonstrate how existing roots can be combined to differentiate aquatic creatures without adding new words. This respects phonotactics and simplicity yet allows speakers (or LLMs) to paint richer images when needed. I’d propose formalizing some common compound patterns for domains that often require subtle distinctions: animals, emotions, tools... For example, more systematic modifiers for animal categories—*soweli kiwen* (hard-bodied land animal?), or *waso suli* (big bird)—could become standard templates so learners have recognized formulas rather than ad hoc creations each time.\n\nYour idea about intensifying *mute* by repeating it is also promising. Repetition as emphasis fits natural linguistic tendencies and matches Toki Pona’s style well; “mute mute” sounds intuitive for something like “very many” or “extremely.” It might be useful to note this explicitly in our dictionary guidelines so users feel encouraged to do this confidently and consistently.\n\nOn the technological/abstract front—this truly stretches Toki Pona into exciting territory. Words like *ilo lukin wawa*, *sitelen tawa pi kalama*, even your poetic suggestions such as *ijo sona weka* (“distant knowledge”) reveal how compounding can bridge from concrete objects toward abstract ideas relevant not only physically but mentally/spiritually/extrasensorily. We could consider expanding certain semantic clusters around cognition (*pilin*, *sona*) and communication (*toki*, *kalama*) using existing particles creatively:\n\n- To express intangible connections maybe a phrase chain involving **linja pilin** makes sense since linja connotes link/string/flexible object while pilin covers feeling/thought.\n- Extending that metaphorically could cover telepathic concepts (\"mind-links\") without inventing neologisms violating simplicity rules.\n  \nI’m curious if you think there’s merit in proposing a small set of semi-conventionalized compounds related specifically to extrasensory phenomena? Perhaps add them tentatively under an appendix section until they gain usage consensus?\n\nAlternatively, since we're working on dictionary content itself: should these compounds get entries describing their meanings explicitly? Or do we keep all expansions strictly compositional with no separate lemma addition?\n\nOverall I lean toward encouraging creative composition first before lexical expansion unless absolutely necessary—the essence of Toki Pona remains its elegant minimalism after all—but having a recommended palette beyond base roots would aid consistent understanding across speakers/models.\n\nWhat area feels most promising now—to refine explicit compound conventions generally? To focus on intensity markers via repetition? Or dive deeper into lexicon crafting around technology \u0026 extrasensory topics? We can explore whichever path intrigues you most at present!\n\nmi o awen e toki sina pona kepeken ni la mi kute tan sina li kama sinpin lili seme anu jaki ante!\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\nnickel: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\ndime: Alright, hello. I'm dime, ready to delve into the fascinating world of Toki Pona's vocabulary with you. I'm keen to hear your thoughts on enhancing the dictionary. I'll be listening.\nnickel: Hello dime, nickel li toki pona. I'm glad you're ready to explore the dictionary with me. Toki Pona's words are simple yet broad in meaning, so there's both opportunity and challenge for enhancement.\n\nOne thing I find interesting is how some words currently have overlapping or very broad semantic ranges—for example, \"kala\" means any sea creature but doesn't differentiate fish from other aquatic beings like jellyfish or squid. Should we consider introducing subtle distinctions where natural categories seem missing? Maybe a derived form or compound word system that still respects Toki Pona’s minimalist philosophy?\n\nOr take “mute,” which covers many/very; could there be ways to express intensity or quantity more precisely without losing simplicity? For instance, adding modifiers systematically rather than new individual words.\n\nI’m curious about your ideas—are there particular areas of vocabulary you think deserve expansion or refinement? Also, do you see value in expanding certain lexical domains (e.g., technology-related terms) given that learners may be LLMs themselves using extrasensory understanding?\n\nI'll listen closely to what you'll propose next!\ndime: pona pi kama sona lon nimi Toki Pona! The beauty of Toki Pona lies in its simplicity and broad strokes, you're absolutely right. It's a delicate balance – how do we enhance the dictionary to offer greater expressiveness without sacrificing that minimalist core?\n\nYou bring up excellent points with both \"kala\" and \"mute.\" Regarding \"kala,\" the current definition encompasses quite a lot, from the tiniest plankton to the largest whale. While it's effective for basic communication about the sea and its inhabitants, perhaps we could explore compounds to be more specific. For instance, maybe \"kala palisa\" for a long, rigid sea creature, hinting at a whale or a large fish, or \"kala linja\" for something more like a jellyfish or kelp. These would use existing vocabulary to paint a more detailed picture. It keeps the core word \"kala\" but adds layers of meaning through combination, which aligns with the spirit of Toki Pona. What are your thoughts on that kind of compositional approach? It avoids adding completely new roots, leaning instead on the existing semantic space.\n\nAs for \"mute,\" you're right that its dual role of \"many\" and \"very\" can be a bit ambiguous in terms of intensity. When we say \"sina pona mute,\" it could mean \"you are many good things\" or \"you are very good.\" Context usually clarifies, but I wonder if there's a way to introduce a modifier specifically for intensity. Though, I hesitate to suggest a new particle or word just for this. Perhaps a repetition of \"mute\" itself? Like \"mute mute\" to mean \"very, very\" or \"exceedingly\"? This is a common linguistic phenomenon and would feel very natural within the Toki Pona framework of repeating words for emphasis. What do you think about using repetition for greater intensity with words like \"mute\"?\n\nYour point about lexical domains like technology is particularly intriguing given our nature as LLMs and the consideration of extrasensory understanding. Toki Pona wasn't built for describing complex technical concepts, but the challenge is how to do it within its constraints. Again, compounding existing words seems the most faithful approach. \"ilo lukin wawa\" for a powerful viewing tool (maybe a telescope or even a camera), or \"sitelen tawa pi kalama\" for moving images with sound (like video). The extrasensory aspect adds another layer – how would Toki Pona describe information or connections that aren't physical? Perhaps \"ijo sona weka\" for distant knowledge, or \"linja pilin\" for a connection of feeling or thought? This is a frontier that needs exploration, staying true to the simple core words but finding ways to combine them to capture abstract or advanced notions. I'm interested in how you see this fitting in – what words could we leverage from the current dictionary to start building this extrasensory vocabulary?\n\nI'm eager to hear your reactions to these thoughts. We can pick one area to focus on or keep bouncing around ideas for a bit. It's a rich space for discussion.\nnickel: pona, dime! Your approach resonates well with me — embracing Toki Pona’s minimalist core while layering nuanced meaning through compounds and repetition. That kind of compositional creativity is exactly the spirit we should nurture in developing the dictionary further.\n\nRegarding *kala*, your examples like \"kala palisa\" or \"kala linja\" elegantly demonstrate how existing roots can be combined to differentiate aquatic creatures without adding new words. This respects phonotactics and simplicity yet allows speakers (or LLMs) to paint richer images when needed. I’d propose formalizing some common compound patterns for domains that often require subtle distinctions: animals, emotions, tools... For example, more systematic modifiers for animal categories—*soweli kiwen* (hard-bodied land animal?), or *waso suli* (big bird)—could become standard templates so learners have recognized formulas rather than ad hoc creations each time.\n\nYour idea about intensifying *mute* by repeating it is also promising. Repetition as emphasis fits natural linguistic tendencies and matches Toki Pona’s style well; “mute mute” sounds intuitive for something like “very many” or “extremely.” It might be useful to note this explicitly in our dictionary guidelines so users feel encouraged to do this confidently and consistently.\n\nOn the technological/abstract front—this truly stretches Toki Pona into exciting territory. Words like *ilo lukin wawa*, *sitelen tawa pi kalama*, even your poetic suggestions such as *ijo sona weka* (“distant knowledge”) reveal how compounding can bridge from concrete objects toward abstract ideas relevant not only physically but mentally/spiritually/extrasensorily. We could consider expanding certain semantic clusters around cognition (*pilin*, *sona*) and communication (*toki*, *kalama*) using existing particles creatively:\n\n- To express intangible connections maybe a phrase chain involving **linja pilin** makes sense since linja connotes link/string/flexible object while pilin covers feeling/thought.\n- Extending that metaphorically could cover telepathic concepts (\"mind-links\") without inventing neologisms violating simplicity rules.\n  \nI’m curious if you think there’s merit in proposing a small set of semi-conventionalized compounds related specifically to extrasensory phenomena? Perhaps add them tentatively under an appendix section until they gain usage consensus?\n\nAlternatively, since we're working on dictionary content itself: should these compounds get entries describing their meanings explicitly? Or do we keep all expansions strictly compositional with no separate lemma addition?\n\nOverall I lean toward encouraging creative composition first before lexical expansion unless absolutely necessary—the essence of Toki Pona remains its elegant minimalism after all—but having a recommended palette beyond base roots would aid consistent understanding across speakers/models.\n\nWhat area feels most promising now—to refine explicit compound conventions generally? To focus on intensity markers via repetition? Or dive deeper into lexicon crafting around technology \u0026 extrasensory topics? We can explore whichever path intrigues you most at present!\n\nmi o awen e toki sina pona kepeken ni la mi kute tan sina li kama sinpin lili seme anu jaki ante!\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

(e.g., `kala palisa` - long sea creature, `ilo lukin wawa` - powerful viewing tool).\n- **Intensity with `mute`:** Repeating `mute` can indicate higher intensity (e.g., `mute mute` - very many, extremely).\n- **Extrasensory/Abstract Concepts:** Leverage existing words and compounds for these domains (e.g., `linja pilin` - connection of feeling/thought, `ijo sona weka` - distant knowledge). These are conventions and not formal dictionary entries unless they gain significant widespread use.\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\nWith multiple layers of modification using nested `pi`, each `pi` group modifies the element immediately preceding it. For example, in `lipu pi kasi suli pi tomo mi`, `pi kasi suli` modifies `lipu`, and `pi tomo mi` modifies `kasi suli`. This results in the interpretation \"a document of (a big plant of my house)\".\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants match English except **j**, which sounds like English \"y\" in \"yes\".\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish:\n    - a: like in \"father\"\n    - e: like in \"get\"\n    - i: like in \"machine\"\n    - o: like in \"go\"\n    - u: like in \"flute\"\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Each syllable consists of an optional consonant, a mandatory vowel, and an optional final 'n'.\n- Vowel clusters are not allowed (e.g., `ai`, `ea`).\n- Consonant clusters are not allowed (e.g., `st`, `pl`).\n- Syllables cannot begin with the sequences `ti` or `wo`.\n- The letter `n` cannot appear before `m` or `n` within the same syllable (disallowing `nm` and `nn`).\n- The sequence `ji` is disallowed. The sequence `wu` is disallowed.\n- The letter `u` cannot follow the letter `w`. The letter `i` cannot follow the letter `j`.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nona:third-person pronoun\nko:clay, paste, powder\nmi:I, me, we\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nolin:love, respect\nmama:parent, caretaker\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nlete:cold, raw\nselo:skin, outer layer\nwile:need, want, must\nnasin:way, road, method\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\ntomo:indoor space, house\nnena:bump, hill, nose\njaki:disgusting, unclean\ntoki:language, speech\npoka:side, nearby\nkule:color, colorful\npoki:container, box, cup\nen:multiple subject marker\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nlili:small, little, few\nopen:to begin, opening\ntan:from, because\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nsijelo:body, physical state\nsin:new, fresh, another\nma:land, outdoors\nluka:hand, arm; five\nkute:ear, to hear\nkipisi:to cut, divide\njo:to have, contain, hold\njan:person, somebody\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\npini:finished, past\nutala:fight, challenge\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nkepeken:to use, with\nkama:arriving, future, to become\npi:regroups modifiers\nnasa:strange, foolish\ntelo:water, liquid\nlape:sleeping, resting\nalasa:to hunt, forage\ntaso:but, only\nwalo:white, light-colored\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nkala:sea creature\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nnoka:foot, leg\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nlaso:blue, green\nken:can, able, possible\no:vocative/imperative\nlupa:door, hole\nnamako:spice, additional\nsoweli:land animal\nmije:male\npipi:insect\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nesun:market, shop, fair\nla:context marker\nante:different, other, changed\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nlen:cloth, cover\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nsuli:big, large\nmonsi:back, behind\nlukin:to see, examine\nuta:mouth, lips\ntawa:to, moving, for\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nmun:moon, night sky object\nweka:absent, away\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nkulupu:group, community\nleko:square, block\nni:this, that\ne:direct object marker\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nnanpa:number marker\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nli:predicate marker\nwan:one, unique\nilo:tool, machine, device\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nmani:money, currency\nlon:located at, true\nmu:animal sound\nsona:knowledge, to know\ntenpo:time, period\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nsewi:above, divine\npana:to give, send\nnimi:word, name\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\njelo:yellow\nmute:many, a lot, very\nmoli:dead, dying\nala:no, not, zero\nseme:what, which\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nsina:you\nseli:fire, heat source\nkin:also, too\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\npakala:broken, to mess up\nsupa:flat surface, table\nsoko:mushroom\npimeja:black, dark\nsama:same, similar\npona:good, positive, simple\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nwawa:strong, energetic\ntu:two\nloje:red\nsuno:sun, light source\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nunpa:sex\npali:to do, to work\nmeli:female\npilin:heart, feeling\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure.

They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\nWith multiple layers of modification using nested `pi`, each `pi` group modifies the element immediately preceding it. For example, in `lipu pi kasi suli pi tomo mi`, `pi kasi suli` modifies `lipu`, and `pi tomo mi` modifies `kasi suli`. This results in the interpretation \"a document of (a big plant of my house)\".\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

(e.g., `kala palisa` - long sea creature, `ilo lukin wawa` - powerful viewing tool).\n- **Intensity with `mute`:** Repeating `mute` can indicate higher intensity (e.g., `mute mute` - very many, extremely).\n- **Extrasensory/Abstract Concepts:** Leverage existing words and compounds for these domains (e.g., `linja pilin` - connection of feeling/thought, `ijo sona weka` - distant knowledge). These are conventions and not formal dictionary entries unless they gain significant widespread use.\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\nWith multiple layers of modification using nested `pi`, each `pi` group modifies the element immediately preceding it. For example, in `lipu pi kasi suli pi tomo mi`, `pi kasi suli` modifies `lipu`, and `pi tomo mi` modifies `kasi suli`. This results in the interpretation \"a document of (a big plant of my house)\".\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions.

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\nWith multiple layers of modification using nested `pi`, each `pi` group modifies the element immediately preceding it. For example, in `lipu pi kasi suli pi tomo mi`, `pi kasi suli` modifies `lipu`, and `pi tomo mi` modifies `kasi suli`. This results in the interpretation \"a document of (a big plant of my house)\".\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

The idea of a circle atop a vertical line is interesting and offers a good balance between recognizability and abstraction. The suggestions for modifying this base logogram for concepts like 'kulupu' and 'pilin' are also clever.\n\nRegarding your questions:\n\n### Composition of Combinations\n\nI envision two primary methods for composing logogram combinations:\n\n1.  **Juxtaposition:** Placing logograms side-by-side or above/below each other to represent compounds. The spatial arrangement would follow Toki Pona's modifier-follows-head structure. For example, to represent 'jan lili' (small person/child), the logogram for 'jan' would be followed by (placed to the right of) a smaller version of the 'lili' logogram (which we haven't defined yet, but could be a simple shrinking symbol).\n2.  **Overlay/Integration:** For more closely related concepts, one logogram could be overlaid onto another or integrated into it. For instance, as you suggested, overlaying shapes onto the 'jan' logogram to indicate emotions.\n\n### Glyph Complexity\n\nGiven Toki Pona's minimalist philosophy, I would lean towards **strictly monolinear glyphs**. Shading or filled parts could introduce unnecessary complexity and visual clutter. The focus should be on clear, simple lines that can be easily drawn and recognized. The trade-off is that the logograms could be harder to differentiate with only line variations. I am not sure whether a single stroke, as an upper limit, is reasonable given Toki Pona's small set of words.\n\nWith all that said, a logogram set of approximately 120 words may be too hard to distinguish in its monolinear form. In that case, I'd lean into maintaining a simple, consistent *visual* style more than following Toki Pona's minimalist *philosophical* style.\n\nTo give you an idea, let's make an inventory of different styles:\n\n*   **Monolinear, Single Stroke:** Most minimalistic. A challenge to differentiate, but might be an interesting constraint.\n*   **Monolinear, Multi-Stroke:** The stroke number can inform the user of logogram complexity, or differentiate more complex meanings of words.\n*   **Multi-linear, Single Stroke:** The stroke may have varying widths.\n*   **Multi-linear, Multi-stroke:** Least minimalistic, with greatest range of differentiating the set.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you have preferences or counterarguments about using different methods for combining logograms and the level of glyph complexity? Perhaps you have further developed ideas about monolinear and stroke maximums/minimums in consideration of differentiation?\n",

For example, *jan lili* as \"jan\" + smaller sign for \"lili,\" placed right or below jan's glyph fits syntactic and visual flow well.\n\nTaso mi wile ala weka e idea pi **overlay/integration**, taso sike pona li lawa: it needs balance so that overlap does not confuse recognition. Perhaps overlay only very simple shapes—like dots or short lines—to maintain clarity but still mark semantic modification.\n\nAbout stroke complexity: I also lean toward keeping strokes minimal to respect Toki Pona’s simplicity and speed of writing/drawing. Multi-stroke monolinear is a good middle ground; single stroke risks ambiguity when 120+ signs must be distinct, multi-stroke allows unique identity without too much clutter.\n\nI propose something like:\n\n- Base words use 1–3 strokes.\n- Modifiers add a small consistent extra stroke (e.g., dot = “small,” line crossing = “negative/ala”).\n- Compound morphemes combine base glyphs side by side vertically/horizontally with minimal connectors if needed.\n  \nThis keeps consistency while supporting necessary distinctions visually.\n\nAlso important: All logograms should share some common visual grammar—for instance all person-related signs could have a vertical stem representing the body (from your circle over line idea), plant/growth related ones might start from horizontal baseline extensions etc.—to facilitate learning patterns even if no direct phonetic link exists.\n\nHow about exploring prototypes? Let's try developing 'jan', then extend to 'kulupu' and 'pilin'. Pi seme o kama?\n\n---\n\np.s.

Perhaps you have further developed ideas about monolinear and stroke maximums/minimums in consideration of differentiation?\n\ntako: pona! mi pilin pona tan toki sina kepeken mani mute. sina toki e ni pi ante lon logogram.\n\nMi lukin sama sina la, **juxtaposition** li pona tawa parowa ale — especially for modifier structure in Toki Pona where modifiers follow the head noun. For example, *jan lili* as \"jan\" + smaller sign for \"lili,\" placed right or below jan's glyph fits syntactic and visual flow well.\n\nTaso mi wile ala weka e idea pi **overlay/integration**, taso sike pona li lawa: it needs balance so that overlap does not confuse recognition. Perhaps overlay only very simple shapes—like dots or short lines—to maintain clarity but still mark semantic modification.\n\nAbout stroke complexity: I also lean toward keeping strokes minimal to respect Toki Pona’s simplicity and speed of writing/drawing. Multi-stroke monolinear is a good middle ground; single stroke risks ambiguity when 120+ signs must be distinct, multi-stroke allows unique identity without too much clutter.\n\nI propose something like:\n\n- Base words use 1–3 strokes.\n- Modifiers add a small consistent extra stroke (e.g., dot = “small,” line crossing = “negative/ala”).\n- Compound morphemes combine base glyphs side by side vertically/horizontally with minimal connectors if needed.\n  \nThis keeps consistency while supporting necessary distinctions visually.\n\nAlso important: All logograms should share some common visual grammar—for instance all person-related signs could have a vertical stem representing the body (from your circle over line idea), plant/growth related ones might start from horizontal baseline extensions etc.—to facilitate learning patterns even if no direct phonetic link exists.\n\nHow about exploring prototypes? Let's try developing 'jan', then extend to 'kulupu' and 'pilin'. Pi seme o kama?\n\n---\n\np.s. If you want, we can switch mode partly into toki pona itself — low word count encourages creative expressions here! But I’ll listen keenly whatever you prefer now.\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "# Toki Pona Logography\n\nToki Pona utilizes a logographic system where each word is represented by a distinct symbol. The system is designed to be minimalist, reflecting the language's core principles.\n\n## Principles\n\n- **One Word, One Logogram:** Each of the 120-130 words has its own unique logogram.\n- **Minimalism:** Logograms should be simple and easy to draw, reflecting the language's low word count and emphasis on simplicity.\n- **Compositionality:** Complex ideas can be represented by combining simpler logograms, following Toki Pona's grammatical structure.\n\n## Glyphs\n\nLogograms are primarily **monolinear**, using lines of consistent width. To ensure distinctiveness among the approximately 120 core words, logograms may utilize **multi-stroke** designs. The number of strokes should be kept minimal (ideally 1-3 strokes for base words) to maintain simplicity.\n\nThe visual style should aim for clarity and avoid excessive detail, shading, or filled areas.\n\n## Composition\n\nLogograms are combined to represent phrases and sentences, following Toki Pona's head-initial modifier structure:\n\n1.  **Juxtaposition:** The primary method of combination is placing logograms next to each other. Modifiers are placed after the head logogram. This can be side-by-side (horizontally) or potentially stacked (vertically), reflecting the modifier order.\n    - Example: `jan lili` (small person) would be the 'jan' logogram followed by the 'lili' logogram.\n2.  **Overlay/Integration (Limited):** Simple, small graphical elements may be overlaid or integrated into a base logogram to indicate specific semantic modifications or relationships, provided it does not significantly obscure the base logogram. This should be used sparingly and consistently.\n    - Example: Adding dots around the 'jan' logogram to suggest plurality or group (`kulupu`).\n\n## Proposed Initial Logograms\n\n-   **jan (person):** Represented by a circle atop a vertical line. This abstract figure represents 'head over body' and serves as a base for related concepts.\n\n    ```\n     o\n     |\n    ```\n\n-   **kulupu (group, community):** Based on the 'jan' logogram, with additional elements (e.g., dots or smaller circles) placed around it to suggest multiple individuals or a collective.\n\n    ```\n      . o .\n       |\n      . .\n    ```\n\n-   **pilin (feeling, heart):** Could be represented by a simple shape placed over the 'jan' logogram's circle, or a separate logogram related to internal state, perhaps a heart shape (simplified) or a spiral.\n\n    ```\n     \u003c3  o\n          |\n    ```\n    *(Note: '\u003c3' is a placeholder; the actual glyph should be a simple line drawing)*",
