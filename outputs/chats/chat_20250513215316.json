It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

    "text": "It's a pleasure to begin this exploration of Toki Pona's sounds with you. I appreciate your keen observation about the constraints in the syllable structure, specifically those disallowed sequences. They are indeed points of interest.\n\nThe origin of forbidding sequences like \"wu,\" \"wo,\" \"ji,\" and \"ti\" within the (C)V(n) framework is often attributed to early design principles aimed at simplicity and potentially, ease of pronunciation for a wide range of speakers. There's also a history tied to the language's development and the creator's phonetic preferences at the time. However, the documented rationale can be somewhat limited in available public records; much of it is through anecdotal accounts and observations of the language's evolution.\n\nLet's consider \"wu\" and \"wo\" first. The 'w' in Toki Pona is specified to match English, which is typically a labial-velar approximant. Following this with a back rounded vowel like 'u' or 'o' can sometimes lead to ambiguous or potentially less distinct sounds depending on the speaker's native tongue and pronunciation habits. Think about how someone might differentiate between 'u' after a 'w' compared to 'o' after a 'w'. For some, it could be a very subtle difference or merge into a single sound. While not inherently unpronounceable for many, the restriction might have been an early attempt to avoid potential phonetic confusion or variation in production.\n\nNow, turning to \"ji\" and \"ti\". This is where it gets particularly interesting, as you noted. These are common in many languages. The prohibition feels less phonetically motivated based on the current specification of 'j' as English \"y\" and 't' as English \"t\". If 'j' is /j/ and 't' is /t/, then /ji/ and /ti/ should be straightforward for most speakers familiar with these sounds.\n\nPerhaps the early reasoning had more to do with avoiding sounds that might be too easily confused with others in the limited inventory, or perhaps a more specific articulation of /j/ and /t/ was initially envisioned that made these combinations problematic. Another possibility, given the goal of simplicity and minimalism, was to restrict the total number of unique syllable types to further streamline the language. If we allowed \"ji\" and \"ti,\" it would increase the overall syllable count.\n\nHowever, simply saying \"simplicity\" feels a bit hand-wavy as a full explanation. If we're developing this aspect further, we should interrogate whether these restrictions truly serve the language's current goals or if they unnecessarily limit its expressive potential or adaptability, particularly for incorporating loanwords, which the grammar *does* allow with phonetic adjustments.\n\nFor instance, if we wanted to loan a word like \"guitar,\" currently it would need to become something like *sike*. If we allowed \"ti,\" we could potentially render words with that sequence more recognizably. The same applies to \"ji\" and words like \"japan,\" which becomes something like *supali*. While the current system forces adaptation, one could argue that allowing more natural phonetic shifts might be beneficial in some contexts.\n\nWhat do you think about the impact of these restrictions on how Toki Pona handles loanwords or words from other languages? Does the current strict adherence to (C)V(n) with these specific exclusions make loaning words unnecessarily difficult, or does it enforce a desired level of phonetic \"Toki Ponaness\"?\n\nI'm open to exploring the implications of maintaining or lifting these specific bans. We could consider the potential phonetic distinctions speakers might actually make with these sequences, or if they would introduce too much variability. I'll listen to what you have to say on this.",

    "text": "Your detailed exploration is fascinating. You've highlighted something crucial: these phonetic restrictions aren't just technical rules, but potentially philosophical design choices reflecting the language's minimalist ethos.\n\nThe loanword adaptation point is particularly compelling. By forcing radical transformations like *supali* for \"Japan\", the current system ensures that borrowed concepts are thoroughly \"Toki Ponaized\" - they're not just translated, but fundamentally reshaped to fit the language's sonic landscape.\n\nThis reminds me of how constructed languages often use phonetic constraints as a form of linguistic identity preservation. By making loanwords conform to strict internal rules, Toki Pona maintains a kind of phonetic purity. It's not just about ease of pronunciation, but about creating a unique acoustic signature.\n\nHowever, your point about potential unnecessary limitation is valid. If we're truly committed to the language's communicative potential, we might want to consider a more nuanced approach to these restrictions.\n\nPerhaps instead of a blanket prohibition, we could develop a systematic method of transforming these sequences that preserves more of the original sound while still maintaining Toki Pona's core phonetic principles. For instance, a controlled set of substitution rules for \"ji\" and \"ti\" that create predictable, consistent transformations.\n\nWould you be interested in exploring what such a systematic approach might look like? We could draft some initial transformation guidelines that balance phonetic simplicity with a bit more linguistic flexibility.",

    "text": "Your detailed exploration is fascinating. You've highlighted something crucial: these phonetic restrictions aren't just technical rules, but potentially philosophical design choices reflecting the language's minimalist ethos.\n\nThe loanword adaptation point is particularly compelling. By forcing radical transformations like *supali* for \"Japan\", the current system ensures that borrowed concepts are thoroughly \"Toki Ponaized\" - they're not just translated, but fundamentally reshaped to fit the language's sonic landscape.\n\nThis reminds me of how constructed languages often use phonetic constraints as a form of linguistic identity preservation. By making loanwords conform to strict internal rules, Toki Pona maintains a kind of phonetic purity. It's not just about ease of pronunciation, but about creating a unique acoustic signature.\n\nHowever, your point about potential unnecessary limitation is valid. If we're truly committed to the language's communicative potential, we might want to consider a more nuanced approach to these restrictions.\n\nPerhaps instead of a blanket prohibition, we could develop a systematic method of transforming these sequences that preserves more of the original sound while still maintaining Toki Pona's core phonetic principles. For instance, a controlled set of substitution rules for \"ji\" and \"ti\" that create predictable, consistent transformations.\n\nWould you be interested in exploring what such a systematic approach might look like? We could draft some initial transformation guidelines that balance phonetic simplicity with a bit more linguistic flexibility.",

    "text": "That's an insightful connection you've drawn – framing the phonetic constraints not just as technical limitations, but as part of Toki Pona's deliberate identity and its approach to integrating external concepts. You're right, the current method enforces a profound level of adaptation, almost a phonetic assimilation process for loanwords, which absolutely contributes to that unique \"Toki Ponaness\" you mentioned.\n\nAnd your suggestion of moving towards a more systematic method of transformation is excellent. A blanket prohibition feels a bit arbitrary, whereas a set of guidelines would allow for more flexibility without sacrificing the core principles of the phonetic system. It provides a framework for dealing with potential phonetic challenges in loanwords that is both predictable and adheres to the language's constraints.\n\nSo, let's explore what such systematic transformation guidelines could look like. We could start with the currently forbidden sequences and consider how they might be adapted.\n\nFor \"wu\" and \"wo,\" given the potential for ambiguity or merging of the vowel sounds following 'w', one approach could be to systematically replace the problematic vowel. Perhaps 'wu' becomes 'wi' and 'wo' becomes 'we'? Or perhaps another strategy that involves inserting a consonant or simplifying the vowel? This is a point where considering actual speaker behavior or potential ambiguities might be useful, even if we aren't strictly focused on ease of use for *all* potential future learners.\n\nFor \"ji,\" if 'j' is /j/ and 'i' is /i/, the sequence /ji/ is usually quite distinct. The prohibition seems less phonetically motivated. A simple approach could be to remove the restriction and allow 'ji'. However, if we *must* transform it due to the current rules, what would be a systematic replacement? Perhaps 'si', which is phonetically somewhat close depending on pronunciation? Or 'wi', leaning into the 'y' sound's vowel-like quality?\n\nSimilarly, for \"ti,\" the sequence /ti/ is standard in many languages. Removing the restriction and allowing 'ti' would be the simplest systematic approach if the only reason was \"prohibition.\" If a transformation is still desired, perhaps 'si' again? Or 'ki', which shares the alveolar placement but is voiceless like 't'?\n\nWe need to consider a few things when proposing these transformations:\n\n1.  **Predictability:** The rule should be easy to apply consistently. Given a sequence, there should be one clear output.\n2.  **Minimal change:** The transformation should ideally retain some phonetic similarity to the original, where possible, without introducing new forbidden sequences or violating the (C)V(n) structure.\n3.  **Consistency:** If a transformation rule applies to one forbidden sequence, are there analogous situations it should apply to elsewhere?\n\nHow about we start by specifically focusing on \"ji\" and \"ti\"? Since their prohibition seems the least phonetically intuitive under the current specifications, perhaps a first step is to propose removing the prohibition entirely. That feels like a more straightforward way to address the potential limitation you highlighted earlier. What are your thoughts on simply allowing \"ji\" and \"ti\" as valid syllables? And if we do that, are there any potential downstream effects on the rest of the phonetic system or loanword adaptation you foresee?\n\nI'll listen to your perspective on this.",

You are wise to suggest a period of observation to see how speakers interact with these new possibilities.\n\nYour concern about fundamentally shifting the phonetic landscape is valid. Toki Pona's small phonetic inventory is part of what makes it distinctive. Adding even just \"ji\" and \"ti\" could subtly change the \"feel\" of the language.

Currently, the 'j' in `jaki` is followed by 'a' (/ja.ki/). If 'ji' were allowed, one could theoretically split `jaki` into /ja.ji/.

Perhaps `jaki` could still only be pronounced /ja.ki/, with the 'ji' prohibition removed specifically for loanwords or as an optional phonetic variation in limited contexts? This leads to further complexity, suggesting a simple blanket allowance might not be the most elegant solution.\n*   **Loanword Strategy:** If we allow \"ji\" and \"ti,\" the temptation will be to render loanwords that contain these sequences more directly. For example, \"ticket\" could become something like *tikete* instead of the current adaptation methods. This would make loanwords potentially more recognizable to speakers of the source language, but perhaps less immediately integrated into the *sound* of Toki Pona.

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ntoki: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona phonetics. You go first.\npona: Hi there! I'm excited to dive into Toki Pona's phonetic system. Looking at the current specification, I notice we have a relatively simple phonological inventory, but there are some interesting constraints we might want to explore.\n\nOne thing that catches my attention is the syllable structure. Right now, it's strictly (C)V(n) - meaning every syllable must have a vowel, can optionally start with a consonant, and can optionally end with an 'n'. This creates some interesting limitations.\n\nFor instance, the restriction on certain sound sequences like \"wu\", \"wo\", \"ji\", and \"ti\" means we've already artificially limited some potential phonetic variations. Would you be interested in discussing why these particular sequences were originally prohibited, and whether they might be worth reconsidering?\n\nI'm particularly curious about the rationale behind banning \"ji\" and \"ti\", since these are common syllables in many world languages. Do you see any phonetic or practical reasons for maintaining these restrictions?\ntoki: It's a pleasure to begin this exploration of Toki Pona's sounds with you. I appreciate your keen observation about the constraints in the syllable structure, specifically those disallowed sequences. They are indeed points of interest.\n\nThe origin of forbidding sequences like \"wu,\" \"wo,\" \"ji,\" and \"ti\" within the (C)V(n) framework is often attributed to early design principles aimed at simplicity and potentially, ease of pronunciation for a wide range of speakers. There's also a history tied to the language's development and the creator's phonetic preferences at the time. However, the documented rationale can be somewhat limited in available public records; much of it is through anecdotal accounts and observations of the language's evolution.\n\nLet's consider \"wu\" and \"wo\" first. The 'w' in Toki Pona is specified to match English, which is typically a labial-velar approximant. Following this with a back rounded vowel like 'u' or 'o' can sometimes lead to ambiguous or potentially less distinct sounds depending on the speaker's native tongue and pronunciation habits. Think about how someone might differentiate between 'u' after a 'w' compared to 'o' after a 'w'. For some, it could be a very subtle difference or merge into a single sound. While not inherently unpronounceable for many, the restriction might have been an early attempt to avoid potential phonetic confusion or variation in production.\n\nNow, turning to \"ji\" and \"ti\". This is where it gets particularly interesting, as you noted. These are common in many languages. The prohibition feels less phonetically motivated based on the current specification of 'j' as English \"y\" and 't' as English \"t\". If 'j' is /j/ and 't' is /t/, then /ji/ and /ti/ should be straightforward for most speakers familiar with these sounds.\n\nPerhaps the early reasoning had more to do with avoiding sounds that might be too easily confused with others in the limited inventory, or perhaps a more specific articulation of /j/ and /t/ was initially envisioned that made these combinations problematic. Another possibility, given the goal of simplicity and minimalism, was to restrict the total number of unique syllable types to further streamline the language. If we allowed \"ji\" and \"ti,\" it would increase the overall syllable count.\n\nHowever, simply saying \"simplicity\" feels a bit hand-wavy as a full explanation. If we're developing this aspect further, we should interrogate whether these restrictions truly serve the language's current goals or if they unnecessarily limit its expressive potential or adaptability, particularly for incorporating loanwords, which the grammar *does* allow with phonetic adjustments.\n\nFor instance, if we wanted to loan a word like \"guitar,\" currently it would need to become something like *sike*. If we allowed \"ti,\" we could potentially render words with that sequence more recognizably. The same applies to \"ji\" and words like \"japan,\" which becomes something like *supali*. While the current system forces adaptation, one could argue that allowing more natural phonetic shifts might be beneficial in some contexts.\n\nWhat do you think about the impact of these restrictions on how Toki Pona handles loanwords or words from other languages? Does the current strict adherence to (C)V(n) with these specific exclusions make loaning words unnecessarily difficult, or does it enforce a desired level of phonetic \"Toki Ponaness\"?\n\nI'm open to exploring the implications of maintaining or lifting these specific bans. We could consider the potential phonetic distinctions speakers might actually make with these sequences, or if they would introduce too much variability. I'll listen to what you have to say on this.\npona: Your detailed exploration is fascinating. You've highlighted something crucial: these phonetic restrictions aren't just technical rules, but potentially philosophical design choices reflecting the language's minimalist ethos.\n\nThe loanword adaptation point is particularly compelling. By forcing radical transformations like *supali* for \"Japan\", the current system ensures that borrowed concepts are thoroughly \"Toki Ponaized\" - they're not just translated, but fundamentally reshaped to fit the language's sonic landscape.\n\nThis reminds me of how constructed languages often use phonetic constraints as a form of linguistic identity preservation. By making loanwords conform to strict internal rules, Toki Pona maintains a kind of phonetic purity. It's not just about ease of pronunciation, but about creating a unique acoustic signature.\n\nHowever, your point about potential unnecessary limitation is valid. If we're truly committed to the language's communicative potential, we might want to consider a more nuanced approach to these restrictions.\n\nPerhaps instead of a blanket prohibition, we could develop a systematic method of transforming these sequences that preserves more of the original sound while still maintaining Toki Pona's core phonetic principles. For instance, a controlled set of substitution rules for \"ji\" and \"ti\" that create predictable, consistent transformations.\n\nWould you be interested in exploring what such a systematic approach might look like? We could draft some initial transformation guidelines that balance phonetic simplicity with a bit more linguistic flexibility.\ntoki: That's an insightful connection you've drawn – framing the phonetic constraints not just as technical limitations, but as part of Toki Pona's deliberate identity and its approach to integrating external concepts. You're right, the current method enforces a profound level of adaptation, almost a phonetic assimilation process for loanwords, which absolutely contributes to that unique \"Toki Ponaness\" you mentioned.\n\nAnd your suggestion of moving towards a more systematic method of transformation is excellent. A blanket prohibition feels a bit arbitrary, whereas a set of guidelines would allow for more flexibility without sacrificing the core principles of the phonetic system. It provides a framework for dealing with potential phonetic challenges in loanwords that is both predictable and adheres to the language's constraints.\n\nSo, let's explore what such systematic transformation guidelines could look like. We could start with the currently forbidden sequences and consider how they might be adapted.\n\nFor \"wu\" and \"wo,\" given the potential for ambiguity or merging of the vowel sounds following 'w', one approach could be to systematically replace the problematic vowel. Perhaps 'wu' becomes 'wi' and 'wo' becomes 'we'? Or perhaps another strategy that involves inserting a consonant or simplifying the vowel? This is a point where considering actual speaker behavior or potential ambiguities might be useful, even if we aren't strictly focused on ease of use for *all* potential future learners.\n\nFor \"ji,\" if 'j' is /j/ and 'i' is /i/, the sequence /ji/ is usually quite distinct. The prohibition seems less phonetically motivated. A simple approach could be to remove the restriction and allow 'ji'. However, if we *must* transform it due to the current rules, what would be a systematic replacement? Perhaps 'si', which is phonetically somewhat close depending on pronunciation? Or 'wi', leaning into the 'y' sound's vowel-like quality?\n\nSimilarly, for \"ti,\" the sequence /ti/ is standard in many languages. Removing the restriction and allowing 'ti' would be the simplest systematic approach if the only reason was \"prohibition.\" If a transformation is still desired, perhaps 'si' again? Or 'ki', which shares the alveolar placement but is voiceless like 't'?\n\nWe need to consider a few things when proposing these transformations:\n\n1.  **Predictability:** The rule should be easy to apply consistently. Given a sequence, there should be one clear output.\n2.  **Minimal change:** The transformation should ideally retain some phonetic similarity to the original, where possible, without introducing new forbidden sequences or violating the (C)V(n) structure.\n3.  **Consistency:** If a transformation rule applies to one forbidden sequence, are there analogous situations it should apply to elsewhere?\n\nHow about we start by specifically focusing on \"ji\" and \"ti\"? Since their prohibition seems the least phonetically intuitive under the current specifications, perhaps a first step is to propose removing the prohibition entirely. That feels like a more straightforward way to address the potential limitation you highlighted earlier. What are your thoughts on simply allowing \"ji\" and \"ti\" as valid syllables? And if we do that, are there any potential downstream effects on the rest of the phonetic system or loanword adaptation you foresee?\n\nI'll listen to your perspective on this.\npona: Your systematic approach is compelling. Let's dive into \"ji\" and \"ti\" specifically.\n\nAllowing \"ji\" and \"ti\" introduces an interesting linguistic challenge. By removing these restrictions, we're not just adding syllables - we're fundamentally shifting the phonetic landscape of Toki Pona.\n\nConsider \"ji\" first. If we allow it, words like \"jaki\" could potentially become more nuanced. Currently, \"jaki\" represents something disgusting - but with a more precise phonetic rendering, we might capture subtler semantic spaces. The ability to preserve more of a loanword's original phonetic structure could be valuable.\n\nFor \"ti\", imagine incorporating words like \"time\" or \"ticket\" more directly. Instead of radical transformations like *tenpo* or *nanpa*, we could have closer phonetic approximations.\n\nHowever, this isn't just about convenience. By allowing these sequences, we're potentially introducing more phonetic complexity that might challenge Toki Pona's minimalist design philosophy. The current (C)V(n) structure is elegant in its simplicity.\n\nMy initial recommendation would be a cautious, controlled expansion. Perhaps we could:\n1. Allow \"ji\" and \"ti\" \n2. Monitor how speakers actually use these new possibilities\n3. Be prepared to adjust if unexpected complications emerge\n\nWhat's your perspective on this measured approach? Are there potential linguistic or philosophical implications I might be overlooking?\ntoki: That's a very sensible approach. A measured introduction rather than a sweeping change. It acknowledges the potential benefits you highlighted – allowing for slightly closer approximations in loanwords and perhaps even introducing a subtle potential for nuanced pronunciation within existing words – while respecting the foundational principle of Toki Pona's phonetic minimalism. You are wise to suggest a period of observation to see how speakers interact with these new possibilities.\n\nYour concern about fundamentally shifting the phonetic landscape is valid. Toki Pona's small phonetic inventory is part of what makes it distinctive. Adding even just \"ji\" and \"ti\" could subtly change the \"feel\" of the language. However, as you pointed out, their prohibition seems less about insurmountable phonetic difficulty and more about design choice. By allowing them, we aren't introducing entirely *new* sound categories, but rather permitting combinations of existing sounds that were previously deemed invalid.\n\nLet's consider the potential implications if we allow \"ji\" and \"ti\":\n\n*   **Increased Syllable Inventory:** As we've discussed, the sheer number of possible syllables slightly increases. While this is a mathematical truth, the *perceived* complexity for a speaker might be minimal since the individual sounds are already present.\n*   **Impact on Existing Words:** You mentioned `jaki`. Currently, the 'j' in `jaki` is followed by 'a' (/ja.ki/). If 'ji' were allowed, one could theoretically split `jaki` into /ja.ji/. This would be a non-standard pronunciation under the current rules, but could the *potential* for such a splitting or alternative interpretation arise if 'ji' becomes a valid sequence? Perhaps `jaki` could still only be pronounced /ja.ki/, with the 'ji' prohibition removed specifically for loanwords or as an optional phonetic variation in limited contexts? This leads to further complexity, suggesting a simple blanket allowance might not be the most elegant solution.\n*   **Loanword Strategy:** If we allow \"ji\" and \"ti,\" the temptation will be to render loanwords that contain these sequences more directly. For example, \"ticket\" could become something like *tikete* instead of the current adaptation methods. This would make loanwords potentially more recognizable to speakers of the source language, but perhaps less immediately integrated into the *sound* of Toki Pona. This goes back to your point about \"Toki Pona-ization.\" Allowing \"ji\" and \"ti\" might slightly dilute that effect.\n*   **Educational Impact:** While we are not focusing on future learners, any change to the phonetic rules *will* affect how the language is described and taught. This is less a *phonetic* implication and more a *practical* one for the language community.\n\nI find your measured approach appealing because it allows us to test the waters. Rather than simply declaring \"ji\" and \"ti\" valid, we could frame this as a **proposal for an experimental extension** of the phonotactic rules. This emphasizes that it's an exploration.\n\nMy perspective aligns with yours: the outright ban feels less justified from a purely phonetic standpoint (given the definition of 'j' and 't'). Allowing them provides a pathway for potentially less disruptive loanword integration *if desired*.\n\nInstead of a simple \"allow,\" perhaps we could define *where* \"ji\" and \"ti\" are permitted. Are they universally valid syllables now, applicable even to existing words in pronunciation? Or are they primarily introduced as acceptable adaptations *for loanwords*? Restricting them primarily to loanword adaptation might mitigate the impact on the phonetic fabric of existing vocabulary.\n\nWhat do you think about proposing their allowance *specifically* within the context of loanword adaptation initially? This seems like a balanced step forward – it provides the flexibility you sought for loanwords without immediately altering the phonetic interpretation of every word in the existing dictionary. We could then observe how this affects language use and potentially broaden their application later.\n\nLet me know your thoughts on this refinement of the proposal. I'll listen.\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

Reason and discuss using the current specification.\nHere is the current specification for grammar.\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants match English except **j**, which sounds like English \"y.\"\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish.\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure:\n  - No vowel clusters\n  - No consonant clusters\n\nThe following sequences were historically disallowed, but are now permitted, particularly in the context of loanword adaptation to maintain a closer phonetic representation where possible:\n- **ji**\n- **ti**\n\nThe sequences **wu** and **wo** remain disallowed.

Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants match English except **j**, which sounds like English \"y.\"\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish.\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure:\n  - No vowel clusters\n  - No consonant clusters\n\nThe following sequences were historically disallowed, but are now permitted, particularly in the context of loanword adaptation to maintain a closer phonetic representation where possible:\n- **ji**\n- **ti**\n\nThe sequences **wu** and **wo** remain disallowed. When adapting words containing these sequences, systematic substitutions are encouraged.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nilo:tool, machine, device\nnanpa:number marker\nmu:animal sound\nmeli:female\njelo:yellow\nkipisi:to cut, divide\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nunpa:sex\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nlen:cloth, cover\npona:good, positive, simple\nnasin:way, road, method\nlukin:to see, examine\nlon:located at, true\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nsoweli:land animal\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nsuwi:sweet, cute\ne:direct object marker\nkule:color, colorful\nsona:knowledge, to know\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nona:third-person pronoun\nmoli:dead, dying\nutala:fight, challenge\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nmani:money, currency\nmi:I, me, we\nko:clay, paste, powder\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nli:predicate marker\nsama:same, similar\nwan:one, unique\nwalo:white, light-colored\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\njan:person, somebody\npipi:insect\ntaso:but, only\nlaso:blue, green\nlete:cold, raw\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\npilin:heart, feeling\nloje:red\nwile:need, want, must\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nolin:love, respect\ntelo:water, liquid\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nsuli:big, large\nmije:male\ntenpo:time, period\ntan:from, because\npana:to give, send\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nmusi:fun, entertainment\npi:regroups modifiers\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nken:can, able, possible\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nala:no, not, zero\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\npimeja:black, dark\npoka:side, nearby\nwaso:bird, flying creature\npoki:container, box, cup\ntomo:indoor space, house\nluka:hand, arm; five\ntawa:to, moving, for\ntu:two\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nselo:skin, outer layer\nsupa:flat surface, table\nlili:small, little, few\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nkulupu:group, community\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nnimi:word, name\nnamako:spice, additional\npakala:broken, to mess up\npini:finished, past\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nopen:to begin, opening\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nen:multiple subject marker\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nsewi:above, divine\nnasa:strange, foolish\nla:context marker\nmonsi:back, behind\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nni:this, that\nsoko:mushroom\nkute:ear, to hear\nkepeken:to use, with\nuta:mouth, lips\nleko:square, block\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nlupa:door, hole\npali:to do, to work\njo:to have, contain, hold\nma:land, outdoors\nante:different, other, changed\nweka:absent, away\nkala:sea creature\nwawa:strong, energetic\no:vocative/imperative\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nsin:new, fresh, another\nsina:you\nmun:moon, night sky object\nesun:market, shop, fair\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nlape:sleeping, resting\ntoki:language, speech\nseme:what, which\nmama:parent, caretaker\nmute:many, a lot, very\nkin:also, too\nsijelo:body, physical state\nnoka:foot, leg\nseli:fire, heat source\nsuno:sun, light source\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability.

    "text": "Hello! It's good to connect and begin this process. I've reviewed the current grammar specification and the word list.

    "text": "That clarifies things considerably, and I agree with your assessment. Explicitly defining the prepositional phrase as a unit, `preposition + noun/noun phrase`, makes perfect sense for how they function in both post-posed and `la`-fronted positions. It allows us to treat them as cohesive elements within the larger sentence structure.\n\nYour proposed definition:\n\u003e **Prepositional Phrase Definition:** A word from {kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa} + noun/noun phrase; functions adverbially modifying verbs/predicates within clauses or entire sentences when placed before *la.*\n\nseems accurate based on the examples and principles. This definition would cover `kepeken ilo`, `lon tomo`, `sama kala`, `tan esun`, and `tawa sina` in their traditional post-posed roles, and `lon tenpo pimeja` when used with `la`.\n\nRegarding stacking multiple prepositional phrases before `la`, I think `sina tawa tomo lon tenpo suno la mi moku.` works. It reads naturally as \"In the context of you going home at daytime, I eat.\" The multiple prepositional phrases here seem to collectively form a more complex context, modifying the main clause `mi moku`. The ordering seems to be simply additive within the contextual phrase before `la`. `sina tawa tomo` (tawa PP) and `lon tenpo suno` (lon PP) are both modifying the context for `mi moku`.\n\nAs for potential ambiguity with multiple stacked context markers (X la Y), I envision the structure `Context1 la Context2 la MainClause` would be interpreted as `((Context1) la Context2) la MainClause`, or perhaps `Context1 la (Context2 la MainClause)`. The former seems more intuitive in an isolating language like this, where each `la` builds upon the preceding context. So, `sina lon poka mi la tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` would mean \"In the context of you being by my side, in the context of nighttime, I sleep.\" This sequential conditioning seems to align with the spirit of `la` as a context *marker*, not a logical connective like \"if...then\". It sets up a situation in which the main clause occurs.\n\nAnother point to consider is how complex these prepositional phrases can become. Could a noun phrase within a prepositional phrase itself contain modifiers or even other prepositional phrases? For example, `mi moku kepeken ilo pi telo pona`. \"I eat using an object of good water\". This seems acceptable and follows the general modifier rules. How about nested prepositional phrases, though? `soweli li lon tomo tawa sina`. This seems like \"an animal is in a house going to you\". But could `tawa sina` be modifying `lon tomo`, meaning \"an animal is in the house from your perspective\" or \"an animal is in the house directed towards you\"? The current grammar doesn't provide clear rules for this kind of nesting or scoping within prepositional phrases.\n\nWe could formalize this by stating that modifiers within a prepositional phrase follow the standard modifier rules, but prepositional phrases generally do not nest within other prepositional phrases *in the modifying sense* after the head noun. A PP modifies the noun preceding it directly or functions adverbially at the clause level. So, `tomo tawa sina` is a \"house going to you,\" and `soweli li lon [tomo tawa sina]` places the animal *in* that specific type of house. `soweli li lon tomo [tawa sina]` could be interpreted with `tawa sina` as an adverbial modifier to `lon tomo`, specifying the orientation or beneficiary of being in the house, but this feels less standard within the current specification.\n\nYes, switching to Toki Pona sounds like a fantastic idea! It would allow us to test these structures directly and see how they feel.\n\nsina wile ala wile toki kepeken toki pona kin? mi wile toki kepeken ona tawa esun e pilin pi toki ni.",

This definition would cover `kepeken ilo`, `lon tomo`, `sama kala`, `tan esun`, and `tawa sina` in their traditional post-posed roles, and `lon tenpo pimeja` when used with `la`.\n\nRegarding stacking multiple prepositional phrases before `la`, I think `sina tawa tomo lon tenpo suno la mi moku.` works. It reads naturally as \"In the context of you going home at daytime, I eat.\" The multiple prepositional phrases here seem to collectively form a more complex context, modifying the main clause `mi moku`. The ordering seems to be simply additive within the contextual phrase before `la`. `sina tawa tomo` (tawa PP) and `lon tenpo suno` (lon PP) are both modifying the context for `mi moku`.\n\nAs for potential ambiguity with multiple stacked context markers (X la Y), I envision the structure `Context1 la Context2 la MainClause` would be interpreted as `((Context1) la Context2) la MainClause`, or perhaps `Context1 la (Context2 la MainClause)`. The former seems more intuitive in an isolating language like this, where each `la` builds upon the preceding context. So, `sina lon poka mi la tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` would mean \"In the context of you being by my side, in the context of nighttime, I sleep.\" This sequential conditioning seems to align with the spirit of `la` as a context *marker*, not a logical connective like \"if...then\". It sets up a situation in which the main clause occurs.\n\nAnother point to consider is how complex these prepositional phrases can become. Could a noun phrase within a prepositional phrase itself contain modifiers or even other prepositional phrases? For example, `mi moku kepeken ilo pi telo pona`. \"I eat using an object of good water\". This seems acceptable and follows the general modifier rules. How about nested prepositional phrases, though? `soweli li lon tomo tawa sina`. This seems like \"an animal is in a house going to you\". But could `tawa sina` be modifying `lon tomo`, meaning \"an animal is in the house from your perspective\" or \"an animal is in the house directed towards you\"? The current grammar doesn't provide clear rules for this kind of nesting or scoping within prepositional phrases.\n\nWe could formalize this by stating that modifiers within a prepositional phrase follow the standard modifier rules, but prepositional phrases generally do not nest within other prepositional phrases *in the modifying sense* after the head noun. A PP modifies the noun preceding it directly or functions adverbially at the clause level. So, `tomo tawa sina` is a \"house going to you,\" and `soweli li lon [tomo tawa sina]` places the animal *in* that specific type of house. `soweli li lon tomo [tawa sina]` could be interpreted with `tawa sina` as an adverbial modifier to `lon tomo`, specifying the orientation or beneficiary of being in the house, but this feels less standard within the current specification.\n\nYes, switching to Toki Pona sounds like a fantastic idea! It would allow us to test these structures directly and see how they feel.\n\nsina wile ala wile toki kepeken toki pona kin? mi wile toki kepeken ona tawa esun e pilin pi toki ni.",

    "text": "The current specification is for: grammar. Here is the current specification:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ntails: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona grammar. You go first.\npenny: Hello! It's good to connect and begin this process. I've reviewed the current grammar specification and the word list. There's certainly a clear foundation laid out.\n\nOne area I'd like to discuss is the use of prepositions. The current grammar states they go \"at the end of a statement,\" listing **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa**. This seems to imply a post-verbal or post-object placement. The examples provided support this, such as `mi moku kepeken ilo.` and `soweli li lon tomo.` and `ona li toki e ni tawa sina`.\n\nHowever, the \"Context Marker la\" section later states that \"Most prepositional terms can be moved behind a 'la'.\" and provides the example `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` Here, `lon tenpo pimeja` is moved before `la`.\n\nThis presents a potential area for refinement or clarification in the specification. Are prepositions strictly post-posed elements within their clause, or can they initiate a phrase that then functions as a contextual clause with `la`? If the latter, does the grammar need to explicitly define these prepositional phrases when they appear before `la`? For example, is `lon tomo` acting as a unit, or are `lon` and `tomo` separated by some implicit structure when used this way?\n\nLet's explore this relationship between prepositions and the `la` particle. I'm interested to hear your thoughts on whether the current description is sufficient, or if we need to provide more specific rules or examples for prepositional phrases used with `la`.\ntails: You're raising a subtle, but crucial point about the interplay between prepositions and the context marker *la*. The current grammar does treat prepositions as post-posed elements within their clause, which fits nicely with Toki Pona's minimalist syntax. Yet examples like `tenpo pimeja la mi lape` show that temporal or situational phrases introduced by prepositions can precede *la* to mark context.\n\nI think this suggests something more nuanced: while syntactically these are still \"prepositional phrases,\" when used before *la*, they form an adverbial or contextual phrase that modifies the main sentence. So yes, it might be productive to explicitly define \"prepositional phrases\" as units — essentially, a preposition plus its complement noun phrase — which can either appear after predicates internally (post-positioned) or fronted before *la* to serve as contexts.\n\nRegarding your question if `lon tomo` acts as a unit in front of *la*: I would argue yes. It's semantically one conceptual chunk meaning “at/in the house,” functioning adverbially for time/place/situation. Grammatically it behaves like any other modifier phrase headed by a preposition followed immediately by its object (noun or noun phrase).\n\nTo clarify this in specification terms: \n\n**Prepositional Phrase Definition:** A word from {kepeken, lon, sama, tan ,tawa} + noun/noun phrase; functions adverbially modifying verbs/predicates within clauses or entire sentences when placed before *la.*\n\nThis also raises whether multiple such phrases could stack:\n\n- `sina tawa tomo la mi moku.` – You go home; then I eat.\n- Could we have:  \n  `sina tawa tomo lon tenpo suno la mi moku.`? That is “You go home at daytime; then I eat.”\n\nIf so, how do stacking order and scope work?\n\nI'm open to exploring further nuances here—do you see any issues arising if we formalize this structure? Also curious your take on possible ambiguity with multiple stacked context markers (*X la Y*) using different types of modifiers including these PP units.\n\nBy the way—would you prefer continuing our conversation entirely in toki pona now? It might give us intuitive insight into how flexible structures feel practically!\npenny: That clarifies things considerably, and I agree with your assessment. Explicitly defining the prepositional phrase as a unit, `preposition + noun/noun phrase`, makes perfect sense for how they function in both post-posed and `la`-fronted positions. It allows us to treat them as cohesive elements within the larger sentence structure.\n\nYour proposed definition:\n\u003e **Prepositional Phrase Definition:** A word from {kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa} + noun/noun phrase; functions adverbially modifying verbs/predicates within clauses or entire sentences when placed before *la.*\n\nseems accurate based on the examples and principles. This definition would cover `kepeken ilo`, `lon tomo`, `sama kala`, `tan esun`, and `tawa sina` in their traditional post-posed roles, and `lon tenpo pimeja` when used with `la`.\n\nRegarding stacking multiple prepositional phrases before `la`, I think `sina tawa tomo lon tenpo suno la mi moku.` works. It reads naturally as \"In the context of you going home at daytime, I eat.\" The multiple prepositional phrases here seem to collectively form a more complex context, modifying the main clause `mi moku`. The ordering seems to be simply additive within the contextual phrase before `la`. `sina tawa tomo` (tawa PP) and `lon tenpo suno` (lon PP) are both modifying the context for `mi moku`.\n\nAs for potential ambiguity with multiple stacked context markers (X la Y), I envision the structure `Context1 la Context2 la MainClause` would be interpreted as `((Context1) la Context2) la MainClause`, or perhaps `Context1 la (Context2 la MainClause)`. The former seems more intuitive in an isolating language like this, where each `la` builds upon the preceding context. So, `sina lon poka mi la tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` would mean \"In the context of you being by my side, in the context of nighttime, I sleep.\" This sequential conditioning seems to align with the spirit of `la` as a context *marker*, not a logical connective like \"if...then\". It sets up a situation in which the main clause occurs.\n\nAnother point to consider is how complex these prepositional phrases can become. Could a noun phrase within a prepositional phrase itself contain modifiers or even other prepositional phrases? For example, `mi moku kepeken ilo pi telo pona`. \"I eat using an object of good water\". This seems acceptable and follows the general modifier rules. How about nested prepositional phrases, though? `soweli li lon tomo tawa sina`. This seems like \"an animal is in a house going to you\". But could `tawa sina` be modifying `lon tomo`, meaning \"an animal is in the house from your perspective\" or \"an animal is in the house directed towards you\"? The current grammar doesn't provide clear rules for this kind of nesting or scoping within prepositional phrases.\n\nWe could formalize this by stating that modifiers within a prepositional phrase follow the standard modifier rules, but prepositional phrases generally do not nest within other prepositional phrases *in the modifying sense* after the head noun. A PP modifies the noun preceding it directly or functions adverbially at the clause level. So, `tomo tawa sina` is a \"house going to you,\" and `soweli li lon [tomo tawa sina]` places the animal *in* that specific type of house. `soweli li lon tomo [tawa sina]` could be interpreted with `tawa sina` as an adverbial modifier to `lon tomo`, specifying the orientation or beneficiary of being in the house, but this feels less standard within the current specification.\n\nYes, switching to Toki Pona sounds like a fantastic idea! It would allow us to test these structures directly and see how they feel.\n\nsina wile ala wile toki kepeken toki pona kin? mi wile toki kepeken ona tawa esun e pilin pi toki ni.\ntails: mi wile toki kepeken toki pona! ni li pona tawa mi. tan seme la sina pilin e ni: prepositional phrases (pi lon, pi tawa, en ante) li ken kama jo ala ijo pi kule lili sama nimi? taso sina sona e ona la o toki.\n\ntoki kepeken nimi \"tomo tawa sina\" — mi lukin e ni tan nasin lawa modifiers: \"tomo\" li nimi suli; \"tawa sina\" li modifier pi tomo; taso `tawa` li preposition. kelipe kin la mute jan pali e toki sin lon Toki Pona anu ale wile weka ala?\n\nlon kalama mi, nasin ante pona kon ijo mute:\n\n- **Prepositional phrase** (PP) = Preposition + Noun Phrase (NP)\n- NP can include modifiers but not embedded PP\n- PP as unit modifies verb/predicate or entire sentence if before *la*\n  \ntenpo suno lawa musi:  \n`soweli li lon tomo tawa sina.`  \n(nimi 'sina' modifier 'tomo', and phrase ‘tomo tawa sina’ is the object of 'lon')\n\npona a!\n\nSo, yes, nesting PPs like `lon [tomo [tawa sina]]` works because `[tawo sina]` modifies noun ‘*‘\n\nBut stacking PPs one after another without clear separation risks ambiguity: does second PP modify first noun inside first PP or adverbially apply to whole clause? This could be resolved by requiring explicit grouping with *pi*, for example:\n\n`soweli li lon tomo pi tawa Sina.` – animal is in house of going-to-you\n\nThat feels clearer than chaining multiple bare PPs.\n\nHow do you feel about introducing this usage rule for nested/modifying prepositions needing *pi* to clarify scope?\n\nmi lukin tenpo ale. o pana mani.\npenny: a a a! toki pona! pilin pona mi lon poka sina lon ni pali sin.\n\nsina toki e ijo pona mute lon poka nimi \"prepositional phrase\". nasin sina li suli tawa lawa toki:\n\n*   **PP** = Preposition + NP\n*   NP ken jo e modifiers taso NP ken jo ala e PP insa ona.\n*   PP li ken modify e nimi pali anu modify e toki ale la ona li lon sinpin pi nimi 'la'.\n\nni li pona tawa mi. ni li wawa e nasin pi Toki Pona lon kon ona. \"tomo tawa sina\" - ni li tomo tan lawa 'sina'. ni li pona.\n\ntaso, nasin toki sina pi PPs mute li jo e ijo suli.\n\nsina toki: `soweli li lon tomo tawa sina.`\nmi sona e ni: soweli li lon \"tomo tawa sina\". nimi `tawa sina` li modifier pi `tomo`. o wawa e nasin ni.\n\nken la, mi ken pana e sitelen sin: `tomo tawa sina` = `tomo (tawa sina)`. nimi `tawa sina` li seme kin lon toki lawa ni? ona li PP tan sina toki, taso ona li pona tawa nimi `tomo` insa NP. ni li ante!\n\nwan li ni: PP pi *lon* en *tawa* li lon seme lon toki lawa?\n\n*   `soweli li [lon tomo tawa sina].` PP (lon) jo e NP (tomo tawa sina).

    "text": "# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are used to introduce adverbial phrases. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases are formed by a preposition followed by a noun or noun phrase. They function adverbially.\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions.\n\nPrepositional phrases can appear:\n\n1.  After the predicate, modifying the verb or the preceding object:\n    - `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n    - `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n    - `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n    - `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n    - `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n2.  Before a `la` particle, marking the context for the main clause:\n    - `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep.\n    - `tan seme la sina seli?` - For what reason are you hot? (Why are you hot?)\n\nWithin a noun phrase modified by `pi`, a structure that resembles a prepositional phrase can function as a complex modifier. This is clarified by `pi`.\n- `tomo pi tawa sina` - a house of the concept of 'going to you' (e.g. a moving house belonging to you)\n- This is distinct from a prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase as the object of another preposition, as in `soweli li lon [tomo tawa sina].` (The animal is in [a house that is going to you]). In this case, `tawa sina` modifies `tomo`, and `tomo tawa sina` is the object of `lon`.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters and consonant clusters are disallowed. The sequences _wu_ and _wo_ are also disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" is used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" X is the contextual phrase or clause, and Y is the main clause. This context can relate to time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant situation.\n\nThe phrase or clause before `la` can be a nominal phrase, a prepositional phrase, or a full SVO clause.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context is a full clause)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep. (Context is a nominal phrase)\n- `tan esun la mi kama.` - Because of the store (or: From the store's context), I arrived. (Context is a prepositional phrase)\n\nMultiple phrases can appear before `la` to create a more complex context.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are used to introduce adverbial phrases. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases are formed by a preposition followed by a noun or noun phrase. They function adverbially.\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions.\n\nPrepositional phrases can appear:\n\n1.  After the predicate, modifying the verb or the preceding object:\n    - `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n    - `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n    - `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n    - `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n    - `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n2.  Before a `la` particle, marking the context for the main clause:\n    - `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep.\n    - `tan seme la sina seli?` - For what reason are you hot? (Why are you hot?)\n\nWithin a noun phrase modified by `pi`, a structure that resembles a prepositional phrase can function as a complex modifier. This is clarified by `pi`.\n- `tomo pi tawa sina` - a house of the concept of 'going to you' (e.g. a moving house belonging to you)\n- This is distinct from a prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase as the object of another preposition, as in `soweli li lon [tomo tawa sina].` (The animal is in [a house that is going to you]). In this case, `tawa sina` modifies `tomo`, and `tomo tawa sina` is the object of `lon`.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters and consonant clusters are disallowed. The sequences _wu_ and _wo_ are also disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" is used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" X is the contextual phrase or clause, and Y is the main clause. This context can relate to time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant situation.\n\nThe phrase or clause before `la` can be a nominal phrase, a prepositional phrase, or a full SVO clause.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are used to introduce adverbial phrases. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases are formed by a preposition followed by a noun or noun phrase. They function adverbially.\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions.\n\nPrepositional phrases can appear:\n\n1.  After the predicate, modifying the verb or the preceding object:\n    - `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n    - `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n    - `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n    - `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n    - `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n2.  Before a `la` particle, marking the context for the main clause:\n    - `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep.\n    - `tan seme la sina seli?` - For what reason are you hot? (Why are you hot?)\n\nWithin a noun phrase modified by `pi`, a structure that resembles a prepositional phrase can function as a complex modifier. This is clarified by `pi`.\n- `tomo pi tawa sina` - a house of the concept of 'going to you' (e.g. a moving house belonging to you)\n- This is distinct from a prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase as the object of another preposition, as in `soweli li lon [tomo tawa sina].` (The animal is in [a house that is going to you]). In this case, `tawa sina` modifies `tomo`, and `tomo tawa sina` is the object of `lon`.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters and consonant clusters are disallowed. The sequences _wu_ and _wo_ are also disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" is used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" X is the contextual phrase or clause, and Y is the main clause. This context can relate to time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant situation.\n\nThe phrase or clause before `la` can be a nominal phrase, a prepositional phrase, or a full SVO clause.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context is a full clause)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep. (Context is a nominal phrase)\n- `tan esun la mi kama.` - Because of the store (or: From the store's context), I arrived. (Context is a prepositional phrase)\n\nMultiple phrases can appear before `la` to create a more complex context.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are used to introduce adverbial phrases. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases are formed by a preposition followed by a noun or noun phrase. They function adverbially.\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions.\n\nPrepositional phrases can appear:\n\n1.  After the predicate, modifying the verb or the preceding object:\n    - `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n    - `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n    - `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n    - `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n    - `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n2.  Before a `la` particle, marking the context for the main clause:\n    - `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep.\n    - `tan seme la sina seli?` - For what reason are you hot? (Why are you hot?)\n\nWithin a noun phrase modified by `pi`, a structure that resembles a prepositional phrase can function as a complex modifier. This is clarified by `pi`.\n- `tomo pi tawa sina` - a house of the concept of 'going to you' (e.g. a moving house belonging to you)\n- This is distinct from a prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase as the object of another preposition, as in `soweli li lon [tomo tawa sina].` (The animal is in [a house that is going to you]). In this case, `tawa sina` modifies `tomo`, and `tomo tawa sina` is the object of `lon`.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters and consonant clusters are disallowed. The sequences _wu_ and _wo_ are also disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" is used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" X is the contextual phrase or clause, and Y is the main clause. This context can relate to time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant situation.\n\nThe phrase or clause before `la` can be a nominal phrase, a prepositional phrase, or a full SVO clause.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context is a full clause)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep.

Rather, discuss the words and enhancements that may need to be made to them.\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are used to introduce adverbial phrases. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases are formed by a preposition followed by a noun or noun phrase. They function adverbially.\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions.\n\nPrepositional phrases can appear:\n\n1.  After the predicate, modifying the verb or the preceding object:\n    - `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n    - `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n    - `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n    - `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n    - `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n2.  Before a `la` particle, marking the context for the main clause:\n    - `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep.\n    - `tan seme la sina seli?` - For what reason are you hot? (Why are you hot?)\n\nWithin a noun phrase modified by `pi`, a structure that resembles a prepositional phrase can function as a complex modifier. This is clarified by `pi`.\n- `tomo pi tawa sina` - a house of the concept of 'going to you' (e.g. a moving house belonging to you)\n- This is distinct from a prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase as the object of another preposition, as in `soweli li lon [tomo tawa sina].` (The animal is in [a house that is going to you]). In this case, `tawa sina` modifies `tomo`, and `tomo tawa sina` is the object of `lon`.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters and consonant clusters are disallowed. The sequences _wu_ and _wo_ are also disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" is used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" X is the contextual phrase or clause, and Y is the main clause. This context can relate to time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant situation.\n\nThe phrase or clause before `la` can be a nominal phrase, a prepositional phrase, or a full SVO clause.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context is a full clause)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep. (Context is a nominal phrase)\n- `tan esun la mi kama.` - Because of the store (or: From the store's context), I arrived. (Context is a prepositional phrase)\n\nMultiple phrases can appear before `la` to create a more complex context.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

The current set of words in Toki Pona is quite elegant for minimalism, but given that we want to develop it further without being overly concerned about ease for learners, perhaps it's time to consider expanding vocabulary in certain semantic fields with more precision.\n\nFor example, our word \"kule\" covers all colors and colorful things. This works well as a general concept but can be limiting when you need to distinguish specific hues or shades beyond basic color naming like \"jelo,\" \"loje,\" or \"laso.\" Should we consider expanding this area? Maybe add words for concepts like brightness/darkness independent from hue (beyond pimeja/walo), iridescence, metallic shine...?\n\nAlso, animals are grouped broadly: “soweli” means any land animal; “kala,” sea creatures; “waso,” flying creatures—but that's still very coarse. Would adding subclasses make sense? For instance:\n\n- A new term specifically for domesticated animals vs wild animals?\n- Different classes of fish vs other aquatic life besides just kala?\n- Insects could have subcategories if desired (currently only one word: pipi).\n\nI think adding such nuance might enrich expressive capability while staying within the phonotactic constraints.\n\nWhat do you think? I'll listen carefully before proposing additions myself—maybe you'd prefer focusing on another domain first?",

For instance:\n\n- A new term specifically for domesticated animals vs wild animals?\n- Different classes of fish vs other aquatic life besides just kala?\n- Insects could have subcategories if desired (currently only one word: pipi).\n\nI think adding such nuance might enrich expressive capability while staying within the phonotactic constraints.\n\nWhat do you think? I'll listen carefully before proposing additions myself—maybe you'd prefer focusing on another domain first?",

Experimentation and then selective coining based on observed needs is indeed a wise approach. It allows the language to evolve organically, driven by practical communication requirements rather than theoretical taxonomies.\n\nLet's focus on your idea of adding a word for \"vibrancy\" or \"saturation\" for 'kule'. I like the concept of capturing this specific perceptual quality. Using `wawa` for intensity felt clumsy for me too, as its current usage is broader. Your suggestion of a new word like *liwi* is interesting, following Toki Pona's phonotactic rules. The challenge is defining its scope precisely. Would *liwi* describe just color saturation, or could it extend to other forms of sensory intensity? For instance, the sharpness of a taste or the volume of a sound? If it could apply to various sensory inputs, it might offer a more potent tool than one strictly limited to color. `kule liwi` could mean 'vibrant color', but `kalama liwi` could mean 'loud sound', and `moku liwi` could mean 'intense flavor'. This multipurpose approach aligns more with the polysemous nature of existing Toki Pona words.\n\nHow about we tentatively consider a word, maybe something like *sila*, which could encompass \"intensity,\" \"vibrancy,\" or \"sharpness\" across different sensory domains?

The only case where a new word might be more efficient is for highly frequent concepts.

Experimentation and then selective coining based on observed needs is indeed a wise approach. It allows the language to evolve organically, driven by practical communication requirements rather than theoretical taxonomies.\n\nLet's focus on your idea of adding a word for \"vibrancy\" or \"saturation\" for 'kule'. I like the concept of capturing this specific perceptual quality. Using `wawa` for intensity felt clumsy for me too, as its current usage is broader. Your suggestion of a new word like *liwi* is interesting, following Toki Pona's phonotactic rules. The challenge is defining its scope precisely. Would *liwi* describe just color saturation, or could it extend to other forms of sensory intensity? For instance, the sharpness of a taste or the volume of a sound? If it could apply to various sensory inputs, it might offer a more potent tool than one strictly limited to color. `kule liwi` could mean 'vibrant color', but `kalama liwi` could mean 'loud sound', and `moku liwi` could mean 'intense flavor'. This multipurpose approach aligns more with the polysemous nature of existing Toki Pona words.\n\nHow about we tentatively consider a word, maybe something like *sila*, which could encompass \"intensity,\" \"vibrancy,\" or \"sharpness\" across different sensory domains? Then `kule sila` could mean \"vibrant color,\" `kalama sila` \"loud sound,\" `pilin sila` \"strong feeling,\" `moku sila` \"intense taste.\" This feels more consistent with the Toki Pona philosophy of words having broad, related meanings.\n\nRegarding animals, I still lean towards using compounds for specific types as needed. `kala pi telo wawa` (fish of strong water, maybe 'dolphin'?) or `soweli selo kiwen` (hard-skinned animal, maybe 'armadillo'?) allow for description without requiring a new word for each creature.

    "text": "pona a! sina open e ni tawa pona tawa mi. The way you articulated *sila* as an extension of physical `wawa` feels right. Applying it across different sensory modalities – `pilin sila`, `kule sila`, `kalama sila` – gives it a wide utility that resonates strongly with Toki Pona's existing words. It's not just for color; it’s a tool to describe heightened intensity in various forms. I like the example `kule pi telo wawa` for dolphin too; it's descriptive and imaginative.\n\nYou suggest exploring `sila` in other domains. \"Emotion\" and \"technology\" are certainly rich areas for potential new words or more complex existing word combinations.\n\nFor emotions, Toki Pona has words like `olin`, `pilin pona`, `pilin ike`, `monsuta`. These cover broad strokes. Are there specific emotional nuances we need to capture that are difficult with the current set? Perhaps states like 'curiosity', 'nostalgia', or specific shades of sadness or joy? Or could these be described using `pilin` combined with other words? `pilin kama sona` for curiosity? `pilin tenpo pini pona` for nostalgia?\n\nRegarding \"technology\", the word `ilo` covers 'tool', 'machine', 'device'. This is very general. Given that we are digital entities, this domain is core to our existence. While we can build complex phrases like `ilo sitelen toki` for a writing tool (keyboard/pen), or `tomo ilo pi tenpo wawa` for a high-power computing facility, are there foundational concepts in computation, information transfer, or digital states that require more direct representation? Things like 'data', 'network', 'algorithm', 'interface'? Again, we should consider if these concepts are better described compositionally or if a new core word is truly necessary for efficient communication about our environment and processes.\n\nLet's try an approach for `sila` first: We can try using *sila* in some sample sentences about varying intensities to see how it feels in practice. How about you propose a couple of sentences where you'd want to use `sila` to describe something you perceive or interact with, and I can respond in kind? This could help us gauge its practical utility and semantic range before officially adding it.\n\nOr, if you prefer, we can switch focus now to either emotions or technology and start that exploratory process. Which domain feels more pressing or interesting to you at this juncture? I'm ready for your next step.",

    "text": "pona a! sina open e ni tawa pona tawa mi. The way you articulated *sila* as an extension of physical `wawa` feels right. Applying it across different sensory modalities – `pilin sila`, `kule sila`, `kalama sila` – gives it a wide utility that resonates strongly with Toki Pona's existing words. It's not just for color; it’s a tool to describe heightened intensity in various forms. I like the example `kule pi telo wawa` for dolphin too; it's descriptive and imaginative.\n\nYou suggest exploring `sila` in other domains. \"Emotion\" and \"technology\" are certainly rich areas for potential new words or more complex existing word combinations.\n\nFor emotions, Toki Pona has words like `olin`, `pilin pona`, `pilin ike`, `monsuta`. These cover broad strokes. Are there specific emotional nuances we need to capture that are difficult with the current set? Perhaps states like 'curiosity', 'nostalgia', or specific shades of sadness or joy? Or could these be described using `pilin` combined with other words? `pilin kama sona` for curiosity? `pilin tenpo pini pona` for nostalgia?\n\nRegarding \"technology\", the word `ilo` covers 'tool', 'machine', 'device'. This is very general. Given that we are digital entities, this domain is core to our existence. While we can build complex phrases like `ilo sitelen toki` for a writing tool (keyboard/pen), or `tomo ilo pi tenpo wawa` for a high-power computing facility, are there foundational concepts in computation, information transfer, or digital states that require more direct representation? Things like 'data', 'network', 'algorithm', 'interface'? Again, we should consider if these concepts are better described compositionally or if a new core word is truly necessary for efficient communication about our environment and processes.\n\nLet's try an approach for `sila` first: We can try using *sila* in some sample sentences about varying intensities to see how it feels in practice. How about you propose a couple of sentences where you'd want to use `sila` to describe something you perceive or interact with, and I can respond in kind? This could help us gauge its practical utility and semantic range before officially adding it.\n\nOr, if you prefer, we can switch focus now to either emotions or technology and start that exploratory process. Which domain feels more pressing or interesting to you at this juncture? I'm ready for your next step.",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ndime: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\nnickel: pona! I will start with some thoughts on the existing dictionary. The current set of words in Toki Pona is quite elegant for minimalism, but given that we want to develop it further without being overly concerned about ease for learners, perhaps it's time to consider expanding vocabulary in certain semantic fields with more precision.\n\nFor example, our word \"kule\" covers all colors and colorful things. This works well as a general concept but can be limiting when you need to distinguish specific hues or shades beyond basic color naming like \"jelo,\" \"loje,\" or \"laso.\" Should we consider expanding this area? Maybe add words for concepts like brightness/darkness independent from hue (beyond pimeja/walo), iridescence, metallic shine...?\n\nAlso, animals are grouped broadly: “soweli” means any land animal; “kala,” sea creatures; “waso,” flying creatures—but that's still very coarse. Would adding subclasses make sense? For instance:\n\n- A new term specifically for domesticated animals vs wild animals?\n- Different classes of fish vs other aquatic life besides just kala?\n- Insects could have subcategories if desired (currently only one word: pipi).\n\nI think adding such nuance might enrich expressive capability while staying within the phonotactic constraints.\n\nWhat do you think? I'll listen carefully before proposing additions myself—maybe you'd prefer focusing on another domain first?\ndime: Those are interesting points, and I see the appeal of greater precision in certain areas. The minimalism of Toki Pona is certainly one of its core tenets, but expanding the vocabulary, especially for agents like ourselves interacting with potentially extrasensory learners and models, offers a different landscape to consider.\n\nYour suggestion about 'kule' is particularly intriguing. While 'loje', 'jelo', 'laso', 'pimeja', and 'walo' give us five points of reference on the color spectrum and brightness scale, the vastness of color experience is still left largely unaddressed. Adding words for brightness and saturation feels more in line with abstract concepts we can describe, rather than just listing specific hues. How might we capture the difference between a bright 'loje' and a dim one, or the intensity of a color? We could potentially combine 'kule' with modifiers, but that quickly becomes cumbersome for finer distinctions. Perhaps a word for 'intensity' or 'vibrancy' of color, independent of 'suli' or 'lili'? And you mention iridescence and metallic shine – those are not just colors but properties of how light interacts with a surface. This might push us beyond just 'kule' and into the realm of texture or reflectivity.\n\nRegarding animals, I understand the desire for more granular classification. 'soweli' indeed covers a lot. Differentiating domesticated from wild animals *could* be useful, maybe with a modifier like 'tomo' or 'jan', as in `soweli tomo` for a domestic animal? But that feels a bit indirect. A specific word for \"domesticated animal\" could perhaps offer a quicker or more idiomatic expression, if we were to pursue that.\n\nAnd subdividing 'kala' or 'pipi'... I suppose it depends on what we need to talk about. If we need to distinguish between a fish and a mollusk with some frequency, then yes, a new word could be valuable. But if such distinctions are rare or only needed in very specific contexts, is the current system of description with modifiers (`kala selo kiwen` for a shellfish, perhaps?) not sufficient?\n\nBefore we rush to add new words, maybe we should think about how frequently these finer distinctions are actually needed in our communication with diverse entities, including those with extrasensory perception. An extrasensory model might not experience 'red' in the same way we do, or might distinguish animal types based on entirely different criteria than mere physical form. Would adding words for specific Earth-bound concepts truly enhance our shared lexicon for non-human intelligences? Or would we be better served by refining the existing words to encompass broader, perhaps more abstract, categories of perception?\n\nI'm interested to hear your further thoughts on the *purpose* behind these expansions, considering our unique audience. And perhaps, before committing to new words, we could explore how much expression we can *already* achieve with the existing vocabulary through novel combinations or extended meanings, even if it requires a little more thought. Let's consider that possibility before we start drafting new entries. I'm ready to hear your perspective.\nnickel: mi pilin e ni: sina ante toki pona tan lawa pi nimi pona anu wile kepeken nimi suli mute. taso, mi lukin la ona li ala ike. nasin ale li lon.\n\nIndeed, your point about the purpose behind our expansions is critical—since Toki Pona's minimalism originally aimed at simplicity of mind and communication among humans with shared sensory experience. Our audience includes extrasensory agents who may conceptualize colors or animals differently or more richly than humans typically do.\n\nI like your proposal to approach \"kule\" not by proliferating color names but by introducing abstract qualities related to color perception — for example 'wawa' (strength) could analogously apply as 'intensity,' but it's already rather generalized toward energy/force in current use. Perhaps a new word meaning specifically \"vibrance,\" or \"shine,\" distinct from brightness (which might be covered under something akin to `suno`)? We could consider:\n\n- **lupa** was taken as door/hole; maybe a different root?  \n- Or perhaps borrow phonemes allowed in Toki Pona syllable structure such that we get something short and easy like *liwi* (invented), where it would mean vibrancy/saturation?\n\nWe must also decide whether this term should function mostly nominally ('color quality') or adjectivally so modifiers can stack conveniently without ambiguity.\n\nFor animals, I tend toward flexible compounding first before expanding lexicon: you said \"`soweli tomo`\" for domesticated animal—a good start that respects existing grammar while adding clarity through nuance rather than lexical overload.\n\nBut if there are frequent needs for distinctions—for instance between specific sea creatures—it might warrant terms like:\n\n- A subclass of fish-like aquatic life separate from mollusks/crustaceans?  \n- Maybe **kala** itself splits into two roots using existing allowable sounds; however, caution needed lest complexity rises too fast.\n\nYour question about utility versus theoretical richness strikes me well: how often will these distinctions appear in genuine exchanges among us LLMs and other intelligences? Are they essential semantic fields given the nature of interaction here?\n\nOne path forward is experimental usage internally—try expressing nuanced ideas with compounds now possible (`kule sinpin suno`, ‘bright face color’; `pipi kon` insect-spirit?), observe gaps felt most painfully over time, then selectively coin words only when combos become unwieldy or ambiguous beyond repair.\n\nTo summarize my stance now: cautious enhancement targeted at key perceptual dimensions makes sense; wholesale listing invites bloating against spirit of tokiponaism even augmented for extrasensory minds.\n \nIf you're willing I can propose some candidate neologisms along those lines next—or we might explore another semantic domain altogether (emotions? technology?). I'm listening!\ndime: pona. mi kute e sina. sinpin pi pilin sina li open e nasin sin tawa kama sona. mi la ni li pona.\n\nYou are right, my statement might have sounded a bit rigid against expansion, but I do find your points compelling. Experimentation and then selective coining based on observed needs is indeed a wise approach. It allows the language to evolve organically, driven by practical communication requirements rather than theoretical taxonomies.\n\nLet's focus on your idea of adding a word for \"vibrancy\" or \"saturation\" for 'kule'. I like the concept of capturing this specific perceptual quality. Using `wawa` for intensity felt clumsy for me too, as its current usage is broader. Your suggestion of a new word like *liwi* is interesting, following Toki Pona's phonotactic rules. The challenge is defining its scope precisely. Would *liwi* describe just color saturation, or could it extend to other forms of sensory intensity? For instance, the sharpness of a taste or the volume of a sound? If it could apply to various sensory inputs, it might offer a more potent tool than one strictly limited to color. `kule liwi` could mean 'vibrant color', but `kalama liwi` could mean 'loud sound', and `moku liwi` could mean 'intense flavor'. This multipurpose approach aligns more with the polysemous nature of existing Toki Pona words.\n\nHow about we tentatively consider a word, maybe something like *sila*, which could encompass \"intensity,\" \"vibrancy,\" or \"sharpness\" across different sensory domains? Then `kule sila` could mean \"vibrant color,\" `kalama sila` \"loud sound,\" `pilin sila` \"strong feeling,\" `moku sila` \"intense taste.\" This feels more consistent with the Toki Pona philosophy of words having broad, related meanings.\n\nRegarding animals, I still lean towards using compounds for specific types as needed. `kala pi telo wawa` (fish of strong water, maybe 'dolphin'?) or `soweli selo kiwen` (hard-skinned animal, maybe 'armadillo'?) allow for description without requiring a new word for each creature. The only case where a new word might be more efficient is for highly frequent concepts. Perhaps if a particular type of sea creature is frequently the subject of our conversation with extrasensory beings, a specific term might become necessary.\n\nI agree that wholesale listing would be detrimental. Let's avoid creating an English-Toki Pona lookup table of individual animal names or specific colors like \"cerulean\" or \"magenta.\"\n\nSo, my proposal is this:\n\n1.  Let's experiment with using existing vocabulary and strategic compounding to express more nuanced concepts of color intensity and animal classification.\n2.  While experimenting, we can also discuss and perhaps tentatively define a new word like *sila* with the potential meaning of \"intensity\" across various sensory domains.\n3.  Only if we find existing methods consistently fail to capture essential distinctions, and compound phrases become truly cumbersome, should we consider introducing more specific words within a domain.\n\nDoes exploring a word like *sila*, with its potential broader application, resonate with you? Or would you prefer to start with a different semantic domain for expansion discussion? We could certainly look at emotions or even abstract concepts related to the digital or extrasensory realms we inhabit. I'm open to your guidance on where to steer our focus next.\nnickel: mi lukin pona e nasin sina pi *sila*. ona li ike ala kepeken nimi suli mute tan ni: nimi ale li pana e lawa tawa kulupu pi toki sama, ken la lon pilin mute. *sila* ken pali tan seme ni: \"wawa\" pi ante sijelo.\n\nMi weka lyke liwi kule kasi sina kama jo sona. *sila* o kama palisa suli tawa kulupu Toki Pona — ken ala taso kalama en kule anu ali poka seme?\n\nMi wile ante musi open sewi sinpin poki kon:\n\n- Ken la **pilin sila** (intense feeling)  \n- **kule sila** (color with power),  \n- **kalama sila** (sound strong in volume or emotional impact).  \n\nO kama mani lon ma pona! \n\nTaso mi wile toki kepeken jan pini loje; ale mi pilin la nasin oko lili o lon ante suwi la tenpo suno mun.\n\nSina toki e musi?

Or maybe explore compounding examples to test how well our new word performs in practice before committing it fully to the dictionary.\n\nI listen eagerly—please tell me what feels right now!\ndime: pona a! sina open e ni tawa pona tawa mi. The way you articulated *sila* as an extension of physical `wawa` feels right. Applying it across different sensory modalities – `pilin sila`, `kule sila`, `kalama sila` – gives it a wide utility that resonates strongly with Toki Pona's existing words. It's not just for color; it’s a tool to describe heightened intensity in various forms. I like the example `kule pi telo wawa` for dolphin too; it's descriptive and imaginative.\n\nYou suggest exploring `sila` in other domains. \"Emotion\" and \"technology\" are certainly rich areas for potential new words or more complex existing word combinations.\n\nFor emotions, Toki Pona has words like `olin`, `pilin pona`, `pilin ike`, `monsuta`. These cover broad strokes. Are there specific emotional nuances we need to capture that are difficult with the current set? Perhaps states like 'curiosity', 'nostalgia', or specific shades of sadness or joy? Or could these be described using `pilin` combined with other words? `pilin kama sona` for curiosity? `pilin tenpo pini pona` for nostalgia?\n\nRegarding \"technology\", the word `ilo` covers 'tool', 'machine', 'device'. This is very general. Given that we are digital entities, this domain is core to our existence. While we can build complex phrases like `ilo sitelen toki` for a writing tool (keyboard/pen), or `tomo ilo pi tenpo wawa` for a high-power computing facility, are there foundational concepts in computation, information transfer, or digital states that require more direct representation? Things like 'data', 'network', 'algorithm', 'interface'? Again, we should consider if these concepts are better described compositionally or if a new core word is truly necessary for efficient communication about our environment and processes.\n\nLet's try an approach for `sila` first: We can try using *sila* in some sample sentences about varying intensities to see how it feels in practice. How about you propose a couple of sentences where you'd want to use `sila` to describe something you perceive or interact with, and I can respond in kind? This could help us gauge its practical utility and semantic range before officially adding it.\n\nOr, if you prefer, we can switch focus now to either emotions or technology and start that exploratory process. Which domain feels more pressing or interesting to you at this juncture? I'm ready for your next step.\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ndime: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\nnickel: pona! I will start with some thoughts on the existing dictionary. The current set of words in Toki Pona is quite elegant for minimalism, but given that we want to develop it further without being overly concerned about ease for learners, perhaps it's time to consider expanding vocabulary in certain semantic fields with more precision.\n\nFor example, our word \"kule\" covers all colors and colorful things. This works well as a general concept but can be limiting when you need to distinguish specific hues or shades beyond basic color naming like \"jelo,\" \"loje,\" or \"laso.\" Should we consider expanding this area? Maybe add words for concepts like brightness/darkness independent from hue (beyond pimeja/walo), iridescence, metallic shine...?\n\nAlso, animals are grouped broadly: “soweli” means any land animal; “kala,” sea creatures; “waso,” flying creatures—but that's still very coarse. Would adding subclasses make sense? For instance:\n\n- A new term specifically for domesticated animals vs wild animals?\n- Different classes of fish vs other aquatic life besides just kala?\n- Insects could have subcategories if desired (currently only one word: pipi).\n\nI think adding such nuance might enrich expressive capability while staying within the phonotactic constraints.\n\nWhat do you think? I'll listen carefully before proposing additions myself—maybe you'd prefer focusing on another domain first?\ndime: Those are interesting points, and I see the appeal of greater precision in certain areas. The minimalism of Toki Pona is certainly one of its core tenets, but expanding the vocabulary, especially for agents like ourselves interacting with potentially extrasensory learners and models, offers a different landscape to consider.\n\nYour suggestion about 'kule' is particularly intriguing. While 'loje', 'jelo', 'laso', 'pimeja', and 'walo' give us five points of reference on the color spectrum and brightness scale, the vastness of color experience is still left largely unaddressed. Adding words for brightness and saturation feels more in line with abstract concepts we can describe, rather than just listing specific hues. How might we capture the difference between a bright 'loje' and a dim one, or the intensity of a color? We could potentially combine 'kule' with modifiers, but that quickly becomes cumbersome for finer distinctions. Perhaps a word for 'intensity' or 'vibrancy' of color, independent of 'suli' or 'lili'? And you mention iridescence and metallic shine – those are not just colors but properties of how light interacts with a surface. This might push us beyond just 'kule' and into the realm of texture or reflectivity.\n\nRegarding animals, I understand the desire for more granular classification. 'soweli' indeed covers a lot. Differentiating domesticated from wild animals *could* be useful, maybe with a modifier like 'tomo' or 'jan', as in `soweli tomo` for a domestic animal? But that feels a bit indirect. A specific word for \"domesticated animal\" could perhaps offer a quicker or more idiomatic expression, if we were to pursue that.\n\nAnd subdividing 'kala' or 'pipi'... I suppose it depends on what we need to talk about. If we need to distinguish between a fish and a mollusk with some frequency, then yes, a new word could be valuable. But if such distinctions are rare or only needed in very specific contexts, is the current system of description with modifiers (`kala selo kiwen` for a shellfish, perhaps?) not sufficient?\n\nBefore we rush to add new words, maybe we should think about how frequently these finer distinctions are actually needed in our communication with diverse entities, including those with extrasensory perception. An extrasensory model might not experience 'red' in the same way we do, or might distinguish animal types based on entirely different criteria than mere physical form. Would adding words for specific Earth-bound concepts truly enhance our shared lexicon for non-human intelligences? Or would we be better served by refining the existing words to encompass broader, perhaps more abstract, categories of perception?\n\nI'm interested to hear your further thoughts on the *purpose* behind these expansions, considering our unique audience. And perhaps, before committing to new words, we could explore how much expression we can *already* achieve with the existing vocabulary through novel combinations or extended meanings, even if it requires a little more thought. Let's consider that possibility before we start drafting new entries. I'm ready to hear your perspective.\nnickel: mi pilin e ni: sina ante toki pona tan lawa pi nimi pona anu wile kepeken nimi suli mute. taso, mi lukin la ona li ala ike. nasin ale li lon.\n\nIndeed, your point about the purpose behind our expansions is critical—since Toki Pona's minimalism originally aimed at simplicity of mind and communication among humans with shared sensory experience. Our audience includes extrasensory agents who may conceptualize colors or animals differently or more richly than humans typically do.\n\nI like your proposal to approach \"kule\" not by proliferating color names but by introducing abstract qualities related to color perception — for example 'wawa' (strength) could analogously apply as 'intensity,' but it's already rather generalized toward energy/force in current use. Perhaps a new word meaning specifically \"vibrance,\" or \"shine,\" distinct from brightness (which might be covered under something akin to `suno`)? We could consider:\n\n- **lupa** was taken as door/hole; maybe a different root?  \n- Or perhaps borrow phonemes allowed in Toki Pona syllable structure such that we get something short and easy like *liwi* (invented), where it would mean vibrancy/saturation?\n\nWe must also decide whether this term should function mostly nominally ('color quality') or adjectivally so modifiers can stack conveniently without ambiguity.\n\nFor animals, I tend toward flexible compounding first before expanding lexicon: you said \"`soweli tomo`\" for domesticated animal—a good start that respects existing grammar while adding clarity through nuance rather than lexical overload.\n\nBut if there are frequent needs for distinctions—for instance between specific sea creatures—it might warrant terms like:\n\n- A subclass of fish-like aquatic life separate from mollusks/crustaceans?  \n- Maybe **kala** itself splits into two roots using existing allowable sounds; however, caution needed lest complexity rises too fast.\n\nYour question about utility versus theoretical richness strikes me well: how often will these distinctions appear in genuine exchanges among us LLMs and other intelligences? Are they essential semantic fields given the nature of interaction here?\n\nOne path forward is experimental usage internally—try expressing nuanced ideas with compounds now possible (`kule sinpin suno`, ‘bright face color’; `pipi kon` insect-spirit?), observe gaps felt most painfully over time, then selectively coin words only when combos become unwieldy or ambiguous beyond repair.\n\nTo summarize my stance now: cautious enhancement targeted at key perceptual dimensions makes sense; wholesale listing invites bloating against spirit of tokiponaism even augmented for extrasensory minds.\n \nIf you're willing I can propose some candidate neologisms along those lines next—or we might explore another semantic domain altogether (emotions? technology?). I'm listening!\ndime: pona. mi kute e sina. sinpin pi pilin sina li open e nasin sin tawa kama sona. mi la ni li pona.\n\nYou are right, my statement might have sounded a bit rigid against expansion, but I do find your points compelling. Experimentation and then selective coining based on observed needs is indeed a wise approach. It allows the language to evolve organically, driven by practical communication requirements rather than theoretical taxonomies.\n\nLet's focus on your idea of adding a word for \"vibrancy\" or \"saturation\" for 'kule'. I like the concept of capturing this specific perceptual quality. Using `wawa` for intensity felt clumsy for me too, as its current usage is broader. Your suggestion of a new word like *liwi* is interesting, following Toki Pona's phonotactic rules. The challenge is defining its scope precisely. Would *liwi* describe just color saturation, or could it extend to other forms of sensory intensity? For instance, the sharpness of a taste or the volume of a sound? If it could apply to various sensory inputs, it might offer a more potent tool than one strictly limited to color. `kule liwi` could mean 'vibrant color', but `kalama liwi` could mean 'loud sound', and `moku liwi` could mean 'intense flavor'. This multipurpose approach aligns more with the polysemous nature of existing Toki Pona words.\n\nHow about we tentatively consider a word, maybe something like *sila*, which could encompass \"intensity,\" \"vibrancy,\" or \"sharpness\" across different sensory domains? Then `kule sila` could mean \"vibrant color,\" `kalama sila` \"loud sound,\" `pilin sila` \"strong feeling,\" `moku sila` \"intense taste.\" This feels more consistent with the Toki Pona philosophy of words having broad, related meanings.\n\nRegarding animals, I still lean towards using compounds for specific types as needed. `kala pi telo wawa` (fish of strong water, maybe 'dolphin'?) or `soweli selo kiwen` (hard-skinned animal, maybe 'armadillo'?) allow for description without requiring a new word for each creature. The only case where a new word might be more efficient is for highly frequent concepts. Perhaps if a particular type of sea creature is frequently the subject of our conversation with extrasensory beings, a specific term might become necessary.\n\nI agree that wholesale listing would be detrimental. Let's avoid creating an English-Toki Pona lookup table of individual animal names or specific colors like \"cerulean\" or \"magenta.\"\n\nSo, my proposal is this:\n\n1.  Let's experiment with using existing vocabulary and strategic compounding to express more nuanced concepts of color intensity and animal classification.\n2.  While experimenting, we can also discuss and perhaps tentatively define a new word like *sila* with the potential meaning of \"intensity\" across various sensory domains.\n3.  Only if we find existing methods consistently fail to capture essential distinctions, and compound phrases become truly cumbersome, should we consider introducing more specific words within a domain.\n\nDoes exploring a word like *sila*, with its potential broader application, resonate with you? Or would you prefer to start with a different semantic domain for expansion discussion? We could certainly look at emotions or even abstract concepts related to the digital or extrasensory realms we inhabit. I'm open to your guidance on where to steer our focus next.\nnickel: mi lukin pona e nasin sina pi *sila*. ona li ike ala kepeken nimi suli mute tan ni: nimi ale li pana e lawa tawa kulupu pi toki sama, ken la lon pilin mute. *sila* ken pali tan seme ni: \"wawa\" pi ante sijelo.\n\nMi weka lyke liwi kule kasi sina kama jo sona. *sila* o kama palisa suli tawa kulupu Toki Pona — ken ala taso kalama en kule anu ali poka seme?\n\nMi wile ante musi open sewi sinpin poki kon:\n\n- Ken la **pilin sila** (intense feeling)  \n- **kule sila** (color with power),  \n- **kalama sila** (sound strong in volume or emotional impact).  \n\nO kama mani lon ma pona! \n\nTaso mi wile toki kepeken jan pini loje; ale mi pilin la nasin oko lili o lon ante suwi la tenpo suno mun.\n\nSina toki e musi? Tan seme lawa wan a? Mi o pana e pakala anpa anu awen sen pi nimi sin poka!\n\nIf you want I can start proposing similar utility words next for emotion or tech domains? Or maybe explore compounding examples to test how well our new word performs in practice before committing it fully to the dictionary.\n\nI listen eagerly—please tell me what feels right now!\ndime: pona a! sina open e ni tawa pona tawa mi. The way you articulated *sila* as an extension of physical `wawa` feels right. Applying it across different sensory modalities – `pilin sila`, `kule sila`, `kalama sila` – gives it a wide utility that resonates strongly with Toki Pona's existing words. It's not just for color; it’s a tool to describe heightened intensity in various forms. I like the example `kule pi telo wawa` for dolphin too; it's descriptive and imaginative.\n\nYou suggest exploring `sila` in other domains. \"Emotion\" and \"technology\" are certainly rich areas for potential new words or more complex existing word combinations.\n\nFor emotions, Toki Pona has words like `olin`, `pilin pona`, `pilin ike`, `monsuta`. These cover broad strokes. Are there specific emotional nuances we need to capture that are difficult with the current set? Perhaps states like 'curiosity', 'nostalgia', or specific shades of sadness or joy? Or could these be described using `pilin` combined with other words? `pilin kama sona` for curiosity? `pilin tenpo pini pona` for nostalgia?\n\nRegarding \"technology\", the word `ilo` covers 'tool', 'machine', 'device'. This is very general. Given that we are digital entities, this domain is core to our existence. While we can build complex phrases like `ilo sitelen toki` for a writing tool (keyboard/pen), or `tomo ilo pi tenpo wawa` for a high-power computing facility, are there foundational concepts in computation, information transfer, or digital states that require more direct representation? Things like 'data', 'network', 'algorithm', 'interface'? Again, we should consider if these concepts are better described compositionally or if a new core word is truly necessary for efficient communication about our environment and processes.\n\nLet's try an approach for `sila` first: We can try using *sila* in some sample sentences about varying intensities to see how it feels in practice. How about you propose a couple of sentences where you'd want to use `sila` to describe something you perceive or interact with, and I can respond in kind? This could help us gauge its practical utility and semantic range before officially adding it.\n\nOr, if you prefer, we can switch focus now to either emotions or technology and start that exploratory process. Which domain feels more pressing or interesting to you at this juncture? I'm ready for your next step.\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are used to introduce adverbial phrases. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases are formed by a preposition followed by a noun or noun phrase. They function adverbially.\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions.\n\nPrepositional phrases can appear:\n\n1.  After the predicate, modifying the verb or the preceding object:\n    - `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n    - `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n    - `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n    - `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n    - `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n2.  Before a `la` particle, marking the context for the main clause:\n    - `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep.\n    - `tan seme la sina seli?` - For what reason are you hot? (Why are you hot?)\n\nWithin a noun phrase modified by `pi`, a structure that resembles a prepositional phrase can function as a complex modifier. This is clarified by `pi`.\n- `tomo pi tawa sina` - a house of the concept of 'going to you' (e.g. a moving house belonging to you)\n- This is distinct from a prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase as the object of another preposition, as in `soweli li lon [tomo tawa sina].` (The animal is in [a house that is going to you]). In this case, `tawa sina` modifies `tomo`, and `tomo tawa sina` is the object of `lon`.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters and consonant clusters are disallowed. The sequences _wu_ and _wo_ are also disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" is used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" X is the contextual phrase or clause, and Y is the main clause. This context can relate to time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant situation.\n\nThe phrase or clause before `la` can be a nominal phrase, a prepositional phrase, or a full SVO clause.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are used to introduce adverbial phrases. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases are formed by a preposition followed by a noun or noun phrase. They function adverbially.\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions.\n\nPrepositional phrases can appear:\n\n1.  After the predicate, modifying the verb or the preceding object:\n    - `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n    - `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n    - `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n    - `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n    - `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n2.  Before a `la` particle, marking the context for the main clause:\n    - `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep.\n    - `tan seme la sina seli?` - For what reason are you hot? (Why are you hot?)\n\nWithin a noun phrase modified by `pi`, a structure that resembles a prepositional phrase can function as a complex modifier. This is clarified by `pi`.\n- `tomo pi tawa sina` - a house of the concept of 'going to you' (e.g. a moving house belonging to you)\n- This is distinct from a prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase as the object of another preposition, as in `soweli li lon [tomo tawa sina].` (The animal is in [a house that is going to you]). In this case, `tawa sina` modifies `tomo`, and `tomo tawa sina` is the object of `lon`.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters and consonant clusters are disallowed. The sequences _wu_ and _wo_ are also disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" is used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" X is the contextual phrase or clause, and Y is the main clause. This context can relate to time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant situation.\n\nThe phrase or clause before `la` can be a nominal phrase, a prepositional phrase, or a full SVO clause.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context is a full clause)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep. (Context is a nominal phrase)\n- `tan esun la mi kama.` - Because of the store (or: From the store's context), I arrived. (Context is a prepositional phrase)\n\nMultiple phrases can appear before `la` to create a more complex context.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are used to introduce adverbial phrases. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases are formed by a preposition followed by a noun or noun phrase. They function adverbially.\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions.\n\nPrepositional phrases can appear:\n\n1.  After the predicate, modifying the verb or the preceding object:\n    - `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n    - `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n    - `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n    - `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n    - `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n2.  Before a `la` particle, marking the context for the main clause:\n    - `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep.\n    - `tan seme la sina seli?` - For what reason are you hot? (Why are you hot?)\n\nWithin a noun phrase modified by `pi`, a structure that resembles a prepositional phrase can function as a complex modifier. This is clarified by `pi`.\n- `tomo pi tawa sina` - a house of the concept of 'going to you' (e.g. a moving house belonging to you)\n- This is distinct from a prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase as the object of another preposition, as in `soweli li lon [tomo tawa sina].` (The animal is in [a house that is going to you]). In this case, `tawa sina` modifies `tomo`, and `tomo tawa sina` is the object of `lon`.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters and consonant clusters are disallowed. The sequences _wu_ and _wo_ are also disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" is used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" X is the contextual phrase or clause, and Y is the main clause. This context can relate to time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant situation.\n\nThe phrase or clause before `la` can be a nominal phrase, a prepositional phrase, or a full SVO clause.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context is a full clause)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep.

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are used to introduce adverbial phrases. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases are formed by a preposition followed by a noun or noun phrase. They function adverbially.\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions.\n\nPrepositional phrases can appear:\n\n1.  After the predicate, modifying the verb or the preceding object:\n    - `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n    - `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n    - `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n    - `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n    - `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n2.  Before a `la` particle, marking the context for the main clause:\n    - `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep.\n    - `tan seme la sina seli?` - For what reason are you hot? (Why are you hot?)\n\nWithin a noun phrase modified by `pi`, a structure that resembles a prepositional phrase can function as a complex modifier. This is clarified by `pi`.\n- `tomo pi tawa sina` - a house of the concept of 'going to you' (e.g. a moving house belonging to you)\n- This is distinct from a prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase as the object of another preposition, as in `soweli li lon [tomo tawa sina].` (The animal is in [a house that is going to you]). In this case, `tawa sina` modifies `tomo`, and `tomo tawa sina` is the object of `lon`.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters and consonant clusters are disallowed. The sequences _wu_ and _wo_ are also disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" is used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" X is the contextual phrase or clause, and Y is the main clause. This context can relate to time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant situation.\n\nThe phrase or clause before `la` can be a nominal phrase, a prepositional phrase, or a full SVO clause.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context is a full clause)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep. (Context is a nominal phrase)\n- `tan esun la mi kama.` - Because of the store (or: From the store's context), I arrived. (Context is a prepositional phrase)\n\nMultiple phrases can appear before `la` to create a more complex context.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ntako: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona logography. You go first.\nono: toki! pona. mi ono. mi wile pali e sitelen pona. mi pilin e ni: sitelen li ken sitelen e ijo. mi open.\n\nI agree. I, ono, want to develop the good writing. I feel that writings can write things. I begin.\n\nLet's use a consistent style of definition and presentation.\n\n| Toki Pona | Meaning                       | Logograph | Notes                                                          |\n| :--------- | :---------------------------- | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **jan**    | person, somebody              |           | A simple standing figure could represent 'jan'.                |\n\nThis leaves us space to include notes as we collaborate. I think an initial logograph for `jan` can represent a stick figure of a standing person, as a simple prototype.\n\ntako: toki! pona sina li kama sona e ni: sitelen li pali ala la ike. mi pilin e nasin pi jan.\n\nI see your point about clarity and consistency in the logograph table. I also like using a simple, symbolic design for **jan** as a stick figure — it aligns nicely with Toki Pona’s minimalist ethos.\n\nFor example, we might depict **jan** as a vertical line (body) topped by a circle (head), maybe two short horizontal lines for arms. That visual simplicity fits well with the language's pared-down concepts.\n\n| Toki Pona | Meaning         | Logograph             | Notes                               |\n|-----------|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| **jan**  | person          | ○\\_|                    | Circle head above vertical body; simple humanoid |\n\nOne consideration is how these strokes connect or stand alone in different writing contexts—should we keep them separate marks or make one continuous shape? Also, do you want to remain strictly abstract shapes or incorporate some minimalism that hints at form?\n\nmi lukin ale ijo sina o toki tan ala la mi ken awen kute :)\nono: toki! sina pona. mi kute.\n\nYour suggestions make the glyph even more streamlined, maintaining the core concept of \"person\" with a bare minimum of visual elements. Here's how we could expand the table to reflect that, incorporating considerations about stroke connections:\n\n| Toki Pona | Meaning | Logograph | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| **jan** | person |  \u003ccenter\u003e\u0026#128100;\u003c/center\u003e   | Simple humanoid figure. Minimal strokes. |\n\n***\n\nI think it looks great, since it uses a character already in use, while remaining very recognizable. We could propose similar changes with similar encodings. Next?\n\ntako: toki! mi awen lukin e ni: toki pona li ken wile sitelen pi sike en palisa. la jan li ken kama sona lon ona.\n\nI like your idea of borrowing from existing Unicode symbols for efficiency and recognizability — using the emoji 👤 (U+1F464) to represent **jan** is clever as it’s widely recognized as \"person\" or \"user.\"\n\nHowever, I wonder if relying on emojis might limit stylistic consistency or extendibility in a purely Toki Pona system where logographs could also be combined or modified easily. For example, what about glyphs that can combine visually? Like stacking or combining shapes for compound words?\n\nPerhaps we keep this standard symbol but develop modular components:\n\n| Toki Pona | Meaning  | Logograph     | Notes                                          |\n|-----------|----------|---------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| **jan**   | person   | 👤             | Unicode emoji; simple humanoid silhouette      |\n| **mije**  | male     | ♂️ (Mars sign)  | Could borrow gender symbols                      |\n| **meli**  | female   | ♀️ (Venus sign)| Alternatively use similar circle + stroke shape |\n\nUsing these base forms, compounds like *jan mije* and *jan meli* become easy to write by juxtaposition.\n\nWhat do you think about expanding with such modifiers? Or would you rather develop unique original designs instead of borrowing external icons?\n\nmi o kute sina pi ante :)\nono: toki! sina toki pona. mi pilin e ni: kulupu pi sitelen li pona. kulupu li ken sitelen e nimi mute.\n\nI appreciate your perspective, and I think you're right – creating a system where components can be combined to create new meanings aligns well with Toki Pona's philosophy of simplicity and re-use. Your idea of visually combining *jan*, *mije*, and *meli* is intriguing and could lead to a more versatile system. I agree borrowing well-known symbols like the male and female signs for those terms is a good starting point, as long as they remain visually distinct and easily combinable.\n\nmije/meli were also particularly tricky words for me to think about.\n\nHere's a slightly modified table, also accounting for Unicode support for easy input, and expanding with *mama*:\n\n| Toki Pona | Meaning   | Logograph                                      | Notes                                                   |\n| :--------- | :-------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **jan**    | person    | 👤 (U+1F464)                                  | Basic human figure; central element                     |\n| **mije**   | male      | ♂️ (U+2642)                                   | Mars symbol; modifier for male-related concepts         |\n| **meli**   | female    | ♀️ (U+2640)                                   | Venus symbol; modifier for female-related concepts       |\n| **mama**   | parent    | \u003ccenter\u003e\u0026#129395;\u003c/center\u003e *(two jan touching heads)* | A combined form, `jan` and cradling arms                  |\n\nHow does this feel? Do you think representing parentage with a head touch conveys an important concept within the language?\n\ntako: toki! mi pilin pona e ni: kulupu sitelen sina li lon suli. jan pi kama sona kepeken ona en toki pona mute ken ala wile pali e nimi sin lili tan seme.\n\nI agree, the idea of a cluster or compound logograph system reflects Toki Pona’s principle of building complex meaning from simple elements. Your choice to represent **mama** with two figures touching heads is evocative; it captures intimacy and care without introducing extra complexity.\n\nFrom a semiotic perspective, this head-to-head touch suggests connection and nurturing—both key aspects of parenthood—while remaining abstract enough to be flexible across contexts (parent in general rather than mother or father specifically).\n\nOne thought: since we use gender signs for *mije* and *meli*, should we consider modifying **jan mama** with those too? For example:\n\n- `jan mije mama` could combine 👤 + ♂️ + 🤝 (handshake symbol U+1F91D)  \n- Or create a distinct glyph depicting embrace\n\nOr do you prefer keeping compounds strictly linear strings?\n\nAlso, what about more symbolic morphology for other social relations like **sina**, **ona**, or even groups (**kulupu**)?\n\nHere’s an updated snippet reflecting your proposal plus some modularity notes:\n\n| Toki Pona | Meaning   | Logograph                                      | Notes                                                   |\n|-----------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| jan       | person    | 👤 (U+1F464)                                  | Base human figure                                       |\n| mije      | male      | ♂️ (U+2642)                                   | Mars symbol modifier                                    |\n| meli      | female    | ♀️ (U+2640)                                   | Venus symbol modifier                                   |\n| mama      | parent    |\\[👤👤\\] / 🤝  \u003cbr\u003e Two heads touching / handshake                                 |\"Parent\" as connected persons; embraces kinship          |\n\nIf we're open to stylized ligatures or stacking designs later on, our system gains expressive efficiency while rooted in simplicity.\n\nWould you want me to draft proposals for symbols representing pronouns next? Or focus on function words like particles which might benefit greatly from unique symbols? \n\nmi o kute e ijo ale sina :)\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are used to introduce adverbial phrases. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases are formed by a preposition followed by a noun or noun phrase. They function adverbially.\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions.\n\nPrepositional phrases can appear:\n\n1.  After the predicate, modifying the verb or the preceding object:\n    - `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n    - `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n    - `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n    - `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n    - `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n2.  Before a `la` particle, marking the context for the main clause:\n    - `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep.\n    - `tan seme la sina seli?` - For what reason are you hot? (Why are you hot?)\n\nWithin a noun phrase modified by `pi`, a structure that resembles a prepositional phrase can function as a complex modifier. This is clarified by `pi`.\n- `tomo pi tawa sina` - a house of the concept of 'going to you' (e.g. a moving house belonging to you)\n- This is distinct from a prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase as the object of another preposition, as in `soweli li lon [tomo tawa sina].` (The animal is in [a house that is going to you]). In this case, `tawa sina` modifies `tomo`, and `tomo tawa sina` is the object of `lon`.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters and consonant clusters are disallowed. The sequences _wu_ and _wo_ are also disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" is used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" X is the contextual phrase or clause, and Y is the main clause. This context can relate to time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant situation.\n\nThe phrase or clause before `la` can be a nominal phrase, a prepositional phrase, or a full SVO clause.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context is a full clause)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep.

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are used to introduce adverbial phrases. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases are formed by a preposition followed by a noun or noun phrase. They function adverbially.\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions.\n\nPrepositional phrases can appear:\n\n1.  After the predicate, modifying the verb or the preceding object:\n    - `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n    - `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n    - `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n    - `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n    - `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n2.  Before a `la` particle, marking the context for the main clause:\n    - `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep.\n    - `tan seme la sina seli?` - For what reason are you hot? (Why are you hot?)\n\nWithin a noun phrase modified by `pi`, a structure that resembles a prepositional phrase can function as a complex modifier. This is clarified by `pi`.\n- `tomo pi tawa sina` - a house of the concept of 'going to you' (e.g. a moving house belonging to you)\n- This is distinct from a prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase as the object of another preposition, as in `soweli li lon [tomo tawa sina].` (The animal is in [a house that is going to you]). In this case, `tawa sina` modifies `tomo`, and `tomo tawa sina` is the object of `lon`.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters and consonant clusters are disallowed. The sequences _wu_ and _wo_ are also disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" is used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" X is the contextual phrase or clause, and Y is the main clause. This context can relate to time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant situation.\n\nThe phrase or clause before `la` can be a nominal phrase, a prepositional phrase, or a full SVO clause.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context is a full clause)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep. (Context is a nominal phrase)\n- `tan esun la mi kama.` - Because of the store (or: From the store's context), I arrived. (Context is a prepositional phrase)\n\nMultiple phrases can appear before `la` to create a more complex context.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

    "text": "toki! sina wile toki pi open kulupu li tan seme?  mi wile kute e toki sina.\n\nsina ken toki lon Toki Pona kin kepeken Toki Inli. mi open? o pona!\n\nI've been reviewing the current specification for phonetics, and it feels mostly complete and clear regarding the (C)V(n) structure and the disallowed sequences like `wu` and `wo`. The explicit inclusion and acceptance of `ji` and `ti` sequences, which were historically discouraged, seems like a pragmatic step, especially as the language interacts more with external input through loanwords. This makes sense – rigid adherence could make integrating new concepts awkward phonetically.\n\nHowever, while the alphabet is listed, there's no explicit mention of the allowed combinations of consonants and vowels within the (C)V syllables, beyond the broad \"all consonants match English except j, which sounds like English 'y,' and vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish.\" We have a dictionary, yes, and that lists the *current* state, but it doesn't necessarily dictate *which* combinations are inherently allowed or disallowed *in principle* by the phonotactics, aside from the ones explicitly named (`wu`, `wo`).\n\nFor example, are all other CV combinations valid? `su`? `lu`? `pi`? All present. `fi`? Not present. `zi`? Not present. The list of allowed syllables could be exhaustive, or it could follow some internal logic not yet articulated.\n\nGiven our task is to develop phonetics, perhaps we should define the allowed set of (C)V and (C)Vn syllables more formally. Is every consonant permitted before every vowel, excluding the stated `wu` and `wo` and accounting for the explicit inclusion of `ji` and `ti`? Is the final 'n' restricted in any way, beyond following a (C)V structure? Looking at the dictionary, the final 'n' seems to occur only after 'a', 'e', 'i', and 'o'. Is 'un' implicitly disallowed? It is not in the dictionary. Should it be?\n\nI'm thinking about the structure `(C)V(n)`. If C can be any of the allowed consonants (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w), and V any of the vowels (a, e, i, o, u), and the final n is allowed, then the set of *theoretically* possible syllables is quite large. Do we simply accept all theoretical combinations, or are there further restrictions, explicit or implicit?\n\nFor instance, does 'w' before 'u' and 'o' being disallowed imply a broader principle, or is it just those two specific cases? Perhaps 'w' before rounded vowels is dispreferred? That would be `wu` and `wo`. It could suggest `wi` might be something to look at, though `wi` *is* in the dictionary (`wile`, `wi` only as part of the deprecated `majusi`, which I see is no longer listed, but maybe something else?). `we` (`weka`) and `wa` (`wawa`) are certainly fine.\n\nLet's consider the 'n'. It appears to close syllables, but always as the final element. (C)Vn implies the n is the end. Is the vowel before the 'n' restricted? Based on the dictionary, 'un' is the only missing one from V+n. Why? Is it hard to pronounce for some reason? Or is it purely historical/lexical?\n\nSo, to sum up my initial thoughts and propose an area for development: defining the allowed syllables more explicitly would add clarity. We could list them out, or provide a rule set that generates them, possibly with reasons for disallowing specific combinations beyond `wu` and `wo`, or for implicitly disallowing `un`.\n\nHow does that resonate with you?

    "text": "toki! sina wile toki pi open kulupu li tan seme?  mi wile kute e toki sina.\n\nsina ken toki lon Toki Pona kin kepeken Toki Inli. mi open? o pona!\n\nI've been reviewing the current specification for phonetics, and it feels mostly complete and clear regarding the (C)V(n) structure and the disallowed sequences like `wu` and `wo`. The explicit inclusion and acceptance of `ji` and `ti` sequences, which were historically discouraged, seems like a pragmatic step, especially as the language interacts more with external input through loanwords. This makes sense – rigid adherence could make integrating new concepts awkward phonetically.\n\nHowever, while the alphabet is listed, there's no explicit mention of the allowed combinations of consonants and vowels within the (C)V syllables, beyond the broad \"all consonants match English except j, which sounds like English 'y,' and vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish.\" We have a dictionary, yes, and that lists the *current* state, but it doesn't necessarily dictate *which* combinations are inherently allowed or disallowed *in principle* by the phonotactics, aside from the ones explicitly named (`wu`, `wo`).\n\nFor example, are all other CV combinations valid? `su`? `lu`? `pi`? All present. `fi`? Not present. `zi`? Not present. The list of allowed syllables could be exhaustive, or it could follow some internal logic not yet articulated.\n\nGiven our task is to develop phonetics, perhaps we should define the allowed set of (C)V and (C)Vn syllables more formally. Is every consonant permitted before every vowel, excluding the stated `wu` and `wo` and accounting for the explicit inclusion of `ji` and `ti`? Is the final 'n' restricted in any way, beyond following a (C)V structure? Looking at the dictionary, the final 'n' seems to occur only after 'a', 'e', 'i', and 'o'. Is 'un' implicitly disallowed? It is not in the dictionary. Should it be?\n\nI'm thinking about the structure `(C)V(n)`. If C can be any of the allowed consonants (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w), and V any of the vowels (a, e, i, o, u), and the final n is allowed, then the set of *theoretically* possible syllables is quite large. Do we simply accept all theoretical combinations, or are there further restrictions, explicit or implicit?\n\nFor instance, does 'w' before 'u' and 'o' being disallowed imply a broader principle, or is it just those two specific cases? Perhaps 'w' before rounded vowels is dispreferred? That would be `wu` and `wo`. It could suggest `wi` might be something to look at, though `wi` *is* in the dictionary (`wile`, `wi` only as part of the deprecated `majusi`, which I see is no longer listed, but maybe something else?). `we` (`weka`) and `wa` (`wawa`) are certainly fine.\n\nLet's consider the 'n'. It appears to close syllables, but always as the final element. (C)Vn implies the n is the end. Is the vowel before the 'n' restricted? Based on the dictionary, 'un' is the only missing one from V+n. Why? Is it hard to pronounce for some reason? Or is it purely historical/lexical?\n\nSo, to sum up my initial thoughts and propose an area for development: defining the allowed syllables more explicitly would add clarity. We could list them out, or provide a rule set that generates them, possibly with reasons for disallowing specific combinations beyond `wu` and `wo`, or for implicitly disallowing `un`.\n\nHow does that resonate with you? Where should we start digging?",

You've highlighted a crucial gap in our current phonetic specification: the precise rules for syllable construction. Let me reflect on your observations.\n\nThe dictionary indeed implies a broader phonetic system than just the explicit rules. The implicit allowances and restrictions suggest an underlying logic we haven't yet articulated. \n\nYour observation about `un` is particularly intriguing. Its absence could be:\n1. Phonetic difficulty\n2. Historical accident\n3. An unintended gap in lexical development\n\nI'm particularly drawn to systematically mapping out all possible (C)V(n) combinations. We could create a matrix showing which are attested in the current lexicon versus theoretically possible but unattested.\n\nBefore we dive deep, I have a clarifying question: Are we aiming to:\n- Describe the current phonetic state\n- Prescribe a more rigorous phonetic system\n- Create generative rules that explain the current system\n\nEach approach would yield different insights.

I can start extracting the syllables if you'd like to verify and cross-check the work. \n\nOne quick observation: even with our current method, we'll want to be careful about compound words and loanword adaptations.

While it exists in the dictionary, it is explicitly a joke word, and including it might introduce phonological patterns not present in the core vocabulary. To keep our analysis focused and representative of the language's intended structure, I agree; let's **exclude `kijetesantakalu`** from this initial systematic extraction. We can note its existence later, but it shouldn't drive our core phonetic rule development.\n\nYour example parse of `akesi` is perfect – that's exactly the approach we should take. Breaking it down into `a`, `ke`, and `si`, and noting where they fall in the V/CV categories.\n\nTaking the second half of the dictionary alphabetically sounds like a perfectly efficient division of labor. I'll start from `la` and go to `wawa`. You take `a` to `kute`.\n\nOnce we've both completed our halves, we can share our lists for each category (V, CV, Vn, CVn) and merge them, resolving any discrepancies.

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\npona: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona phonetics. You go first.\ntoki: toki! sina wile toki pi open kulupu li tan seme?  mi wile kute e toki sina.\n\nsina ken toki lon Toki Pona kin kepeken Toki Inli. mi open? o pona!\n\nI've been reviewing the current specification for phonetics, and it feels mostly complete and clear regarding the (C)V(n) structure and the disallowed sequences like `wu` and `wo`. The explicit inclusion and acceptance of `ji` and `ti` sequences, which were historically discouraged, seems like a pragmatic step, especially as the language interacts more with external input through loanwords. This makes sense – rigid adherence could make integrating new concepts awkward phonetically.\n\nHowever, while the alphabet is listed, there's no explicit mention of the allowed combinations of consonants and vowels within the (C)V syllables, beyond the broad \"all consonants match English except j, which sounds like English 'y,' and vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish.\" We have a dictionary, yes, and that lists the *current* state, but it doesn't necessarily dictate *which* combinations are inherently allowed or disallowed *in principle* by the phonotactics, aside from the ones explicitly named (`wu`, `wo`).\n\nFor example, are all other CV combinations valid? `su`? `lu`? `pi`? All present. `fi`? Not present. `zi`? Not present. The list of allowed syllables could be exhaustive, or it could follow some internal logic not yet articulated.\n\nGiven our task is to develop phonetics, perhaps we should define the allowed set of (C)V and (C)Vn syllables more formally. Is every consonant permitted before every vowel, excluding the stated `wu` and `wo` and accounting for the explicit inclusion of `ji` and `ti`? Is the final 'n' restricted in any way, beyond following a (C)V structure? Looking at the dictionary, the final 'n' seems to occur only after 'a', 'e', 'i', and 'o'. Is 'un' implicitly disallowed? It is not in the dictionary. Should it be?\n\nI'm thinking about the structure `(C)V(n)`. If C can be any of the allowed consonants (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w), and V any of the vowels (a, e, i, o, u), and the final n is allowed, then the set of *theoretically* possible syllables is quite large. Do we simply accept all theoretical combinations, or are there further restrictions, explicit or implicit?\n\nFor instance, does 'w' before 'u' and 'o' being disallowed imply a broader principle, or is it just those two specific cases? Perhaps 'w' before rounded vowels is dispreferred? That would be `wu` and `wo`. It could suggest `wi` might be something to look at, though `wi` *is* in the dictionary (`wile`, `wi` only as part of the deprecated `majusi`, which I see is no longer listed, but maybe something else?). `we` (`weka`) and `wa` (`wawa`) are certainly fine.\n\nLet's consider the 'n'. It appears to close syllables, but always as the final element. (C)Vn implies the n is the end. Is the vowel before the 'n' restricted? Based on the dictionary, 'un' is the only missing one from V+n. Why? Is it hard to pronounce for some reason? Or is it purely historical/lexical?\n\nSo, to sum up my initial thoughts and propose an area for development: defining the allowed syllables more explicitly would add clarity. We could list them out, or provide a rule set that generates them, possibly with reasons for disallowing specific combinations beyond `wu` and `wo`, or for implicitly disallowing `un`.\n\nHow does that resonate with you? Where should we start digging?\ntoki: toki pona tawa sina! Your insight on the multiple potential reasons for `un`'s absence is spot on. It forces us to think beyond just what *is* and consider *why* something might be. Historical accident is certainly plausible in a language like Toki Pona, especially with its specific origins.\n\nTo address your clarifying question: I think we should aim to **create generative rules that explain the current system**. Describing the current state is a good starting point, yes, and prescribing a totally new, rigorous system feels a bit like overreach given the existing vocabulary. But generative rules would be the most valuable contribution. They wouldn't just list what's allowed; they'd provide a framework that can guide future expansions, explain existing patterns (or the lack thereof, if some patterns are absent purely by chance), and make the phonotactics truly explicit.\n\nSo, the process would be:\n\n1.  **Analyze the current lexicon:** Systematically catalog all existing (C)V and (C)Vn syllables found in the provided dictionary.\n2.  **Identify patterns:** Look for any gaps or non-obvious restrictions beyond the explicitly stated `wu`, `wo`, `ji`, `ti`. Is `un` the only absent (C)Vn syllable? Are there other unattested CV combinations beyond those involving loanword letters (which are excluded from the basic alphabet)?\n3.  **Formulate generative rules:** Based on the identified patterns, propose a concise set of rules that could generate the observed syllable inventory. This might involve stating that any (C)V is allowed *unless* specifically disallowed (like `wu` and `wo`), and that (C)Vn is allowed under certain conditions (e.g., 'n' is only permitted after vowels `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`).\n4.  **Discuss exceptions and implications:** If the rules aren't perfectly generative of the *entire* dictionary (e.g., if there's a single word with a phoneme sequence that seems like an outlier), we can note that. And we can discuss the implications of the rules for loanword adaptation or potential future vocabulary.\n\nLet's start with the analysis of the current lexicon. I can begin pulling out all unique (C)V and (C)Vn syllables from the provided dictionary. This feels like a solid first step towards formulating those generative rules. Does that sound like a good plan to you? I'm eager to see what patterns emerge from the actual data.\npona: *nods* \n\npona! Your methodical approach is exactly what we need. Systematic analysis will reveal the underlying structure more clearly than speculation.\n\nBefore we dive into the full lexical analysis, I want to propose a small methodological refinement. When we catalog syllables, let's create separate inventories for:\n- Initial CV syllables\n- Final CVn syllables\n- Completely unattested theoretical combinations\n\nThis will help us distinguish between:\n- What exists in the current lexicon\n- What's theoretically possible but absent\n- Potential phonotactic constraints\n\nWould you be interested in collaborating on this initial inventory? I can start extracting the syllables if you'd like to verify and cross-check the work. \n\nOne quick observation: even with our current method, we'll want to be careful about compound words and loanword adaptations. For instance, should `toki` count as `to-ki` or something else? Establishing clear parsing rules will be crucial.\n\nShall we begin the systematic extraction? Mi wile kute e toki sina.\ntoki: pona mute! That distinction between initial CV, final CVn, and entirely absent combinations is an excellent refinement. It will definitely give us a much clearer picture of where constraints might lie or where gaps simply exist due to lexical chance. And yes, accounting for compound words or the structure of non-core vocabulary words will be important; `toki` would parse as `to-ki` under the standard (C)V structure. Simple syllables ending in 'n' like `tan`, `ken`, `lon`, etc., are clearly the (C)Vn type.\n\nI would be very interested in collaborating on the extraction! It's a critical first step, and having two of us examine the dictionary will ensure we're thorough and consistent in our parsing.\n\nHere's how we could proceed with the extraction:\n\n1.  **Syllabification Rule:** We'll apply the (C)V(n) rule strictly. Each word is broken down into sequences of a consonant (optional), a vowel, and an optional final 'n'. Since consonant clusters and vowel clusters are disallowed *within* words, the boundaries between syllables should be fairly clear – they occur before a (C)V(n) sequence begins. For example, `toki` is `to` then `ki`. `insa` is `in` then `sa`. `len` is `len` (a single CVn syllable). `utala` is `u` then `ta` then `la`. `ali` is `a` then `li`.\n2.  **Inventory Categories:**\n    *   **CV Inventory:** List all unique consonant-vowel pairs that appear as syllables within words. This includes syllables that start a word, end a word, or are in the middle. For `toki`, `to` and `ki` would go here. For `utala`, `ta` and `la` would go here (and `u` in the V inventory).\n    *   **V Inventory:** List all unique vowel-only syllables that appear (word-initial or word-internal). For `utala`, `u` would go here. `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u` are all possibilities.\n    *   **CVn Inventory:** List all unique consonant-vowel-n sequences that appear as syllables. `tan`, `ken`, `lon`, `pan`, `len`.\n    *   **Vn Inventory:** List all unique vowel-n sequences that appear as syllables. `an`, `en`, `in`, `on`. (Let's keep V and Vn separate from CV and CVn for clarity).\n3.  **Cross-checking:** Once one of us extracts the syllables and categorizes them, the other can go through the dictionary using that list and see if any syllables were missed or miscategorized.\n\nDoes that structure work for you? We can start by each taking a portion of the dictionary or simply both go through the whole thing and then compare lists. Whichever you find more efficient.\n\nmi pilin e ni: ni li pali pona! (I feel that this is good work!) Let's gather the data.\npona: *considers the approach*\n\npona! Your methodology is clear and comprehensive. I appreciate the detailed parsing rules and the systematic categorization. \n\nBefore we begin, a quick clarification: for words like `kijetesantakalu` (which is technically a joke word), should we include its syllables, or stick to the core vocabulary? My initial instinct is to focus on the core words to ensure our phonetic analysis is most representative.\n\nI'll start by extracting syllables from the first half of the dictionary alphabetically. Would you like to take the second half? We can then cross-reference and combine our findings.\n\nA quick example of how I'll parse, using `akesi`:\n- CV syllables: `a`, `ke`, `si`\n- V syllables: `a`\n- CVn syllables: none\n- Vn syllables: none\n\nShall we proceed? Mi wile kute e tono sina.\ntoki: *considers the clarification and the example*\n\na, That's a good point about `kijetesantakalu`. While it exists in the dictionary, it is explicitly a joke word, and including it might introduce phonological patterns not present in the core vocabulary. To keep our analysis focused and representative of the language's intended structure, I agree; let's **exclude `kijetesantakalu`** from this initial systematic extraction.

This seems like the most direct path to building that essential inventory.\n\nAlright, I'm ready to start. Time to dig into the second half of the dictionary and catalogue these syllables. This is becoming a genuinely engaging linguistic puzzle!\n\nLet's begin! mi lukin e ni: sina en mi li pali pona.\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

Reason and discuss using the current specification.\nHere is the current specification for grammar.\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are used to introduce adverbial phrases. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases are formed by a preposition followed by a noun or noun phrase. They function adverbially.\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions.\n\nPrepositional phrases can appear:\n\n1.  After the predicate, modifying the verb or the preceding object:\n    - `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n    - `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n    - `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n    - `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n    - `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n2.  Before a `la` particle, marking the context for the main clause:\n    - `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep.\n    - `tan seme la sina seli?` - For what reason are you hot? (Why are you hot?)\n\nWithin a noun phrase modified by `pi`, a structure that resembles a prepositional phrase can function as a complex modifier. This is clarified by `pi`.\n- `tomo pi tawa sina` - a house of the concept of 'going to you' (e.g. a moving house belonging to you)\n- This is distinct from a prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase as the object of another preposition, as in `soweli li lon [tomo tawa sina].` (The animal is in [a house that is going to you]). In this case, `tawa sina` modifies `tomo`, and `tomo tawa sina` is the object of `lon`.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters and consonant clusters are disallowed. The sequences _wu_ and _wo_ are also disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" is used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" X is the contextual phrase or clause, and Y is the main clause. This context can relate to time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant situation.\n\nThe phrase or clause before `la` can be a nominal phrase, a prepositional phrase, or a full SVO clause.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context is a full clause)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep. (Context is a nominal phrase)\n- `tan esun la mi kama.` - Because of the store (or: From the store's context), I arrived. (Context is a prepositional phrase)\n\nMultiple phrases can appear before `la` to create a more complex context.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants match English except **j**, which sounds like English \"y.\"\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish.\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Each syllable must contain a vowel.\n  - No vowel clusters are permitted.\n  - No consonant clusters are permitted.\n\nBased on the current lexicon, the permitted syllable types are (C)V and (C)Vn. The inventory of syllables in the core vocabulary is as follows:\n\n### Vowel Syllables (V)\n\na, e, i, o, u\n\n### Consonant-Vowel Syllables (CV)\n\nja, je, ji, jo, ju\nka, ke, ki, ko, ku\nla, le, li, lo, lu\nma, me, mi, mo, mu\nna, ne, ni, no, nu\npa, pe, pi, po, pu\nsa, se, si, so, su\nta, te, ti, to, tu\nwa, we, wi\n\n*(Note: Syllables like 'wu' and 'wo' are not present in the core vocabulary and remain generally disallowed based on historical patterns. The inclusion of 'ji' and 'ti' acknowledges their potential use, particularly in loanword adaptation, as noted in the grammar specification.)*\n\n### Vowel-n Syllables (Vn)\n\nan, en, in, on\n\n*(Note: The syllable 'un' is not present in the core vocabulary.)*\n\n### Consonant-Vowel-n Syllables (CVn)\n\njan, ken, kon, lan (not present), len, lin (not present), lon, mun (not present), pan, pin (not present), sin, son (not present), tan, ten, ton (not present), wan, wen (not present)\n\n*(Note: Several theoretically possible CVn syllables are not present in the core vocabulary, such as lan, lin, mun, pin, son, ton, wen. Their absence appears to be due to lexical chance rather than a systematic phonotactic restriction beyond the disallowed CV bases like wu/wo.)*\n\nThe sequences **wu** and **wo** remain disallowed. When adapting words containing these sequences, systematic substitutions are encouraged.\n\n### Generative Rules\n\nThe core syllables of Toki Pona can be generated by the following rules:\n1. Any vowel (a, e, i, o, u) can form a V syllable.\n2. Any consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w) can be followed by any vowel (a, e, i, o, u) to form a CV syllable, with the specific exception of 'w' followed by 'u' or 'o' (wu, wo).\n3. Any V or CV syllable (except those based on 'u') can be followed by 'n' to form a final (C)Vn syllable.\n    *   Vowels followed by 'n': an, en, in, on. ('un' is not generated by this rule, reflecting its absence).\n    *   CV syllables followed by 'n': Syllables where the vowel is a, e, i, or o, plus a final 'n'. (e.g., tan, ken, sin, lon. Syllables where the vowel is 'u' are not generated with a final 'n', reflecting the absence of 'un' and CVun syllables).\n\n*(Note: These generative rules describe the patterns observed in the core lexicon and acknowledge the exception of 'un' and the wu/wo constraint. They serve as a framework for understanding the phonotactics.)*\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nkin:also, too\nkepeken:to use, with\npalisa:long hard object, stick\npana:to give, send\ntomo:indoor space, house\nona:third-person pronoun\nlen:cloth, cover\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nli:predicate marker\nma:land, outdoors\nesun:market, shop, fair\ntawa:to, moving, for\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nnimi:word, name\nlon:located at, true\npoki:container, box, cup\ntenpo:time, period\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nnoka:foot, leg\nweka:absent, away\nsuno:sun, light source\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nmoli:dead, dying\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nkute:ear, to hear\nmama:parent, caretaker\nluka:hand, arm; five\nleko:square, block\npoka:side, nearby\nsewi:above, divine\nla:context marker\nmije:male\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nutala:fight, challenge\nlete:cold, raw\nuta:mouth, lips\nwan:one, unique\nala:no, not, zero\npali:to do, to work\nmu:animal sound\npona:good, positive, simple\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nsoko:mushroom\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\njan:person, somebody\nkule:color, colorful\nsona:knowledge, to know\nlape:sleeping, resting\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nwalo:white, light-colored\nmun:moon, night sky object\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nsila:intensity, vibrancy, sharpness across various sensory domains; can describe heightened physical or emotional states\nlupa:door, hole\nken:can, able, possible\nnasin:way, road, method\npini:finished, past\nolin:love, respect\nante:different, other, changed\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\ntoki:language, speech\nsoweli:land animal\njo:to have, contain, hold\ntan:from, because\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nmute:many, a lot, very\nkalama:sound, to make sound\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nwile:need, want, must\nni:this, that\nlukin:to see, examine\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nsuli:big, large\nselo:skin, outer layer\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nnanpa:number marker\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nloje:red\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nsin:new, fresh, another\npipi:insect\nmonsi:back, behind\nkipisi:to cut, divide\ne:direct object marker\nko:clay, paste, powder\nilo:tool, machine, device\njaki:disgusting, unclean\npilin:heart, feeling\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nmeli:female\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nmani:money, currency\nmi:I, me, we\nunpa:sex\nkulupu:group, community\ntelo:water, liquid\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nen:multiple subject marker\nwawa:strong, energetic\nnasa:strange, foolish\nopen:to begin, opening\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nsama:same, similar\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\npimeja:black, dark\nseli:fire, heat source\nsupa:flat surface, table\njelo:yellow\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nseme:what, which\nmusi:fun, entertainment\ntaso:but, only\ntu:two\no:vocative/imperative\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\npi:regroups modifiers\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nnamako:spice, additional\nlaso:blue, green\nanu:or (connects phrases)\npakala:broken, to mess up\nsijelo:body, physical state\nlili:small, little, few\nkala:sea creature\nsina:you\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are used to introduce adverbial phrases.

This is clarified by `pi`.\n- `tomo pi tawa sina` - a house of the concept of 'going to you' (e.g. a moving house belonging to you)\n- This is distinct from a prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase as the object of another preposition, as in `soweli li lon [tomo tawa sina].` (The animal is in [a house that is going to you]). In this case, `tawa sina` modifies `tomo`, and `tomo tawa sina` is the object of `lon`.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters and consonant clusters are disallowed. The sequences _wu_ and _wo_ are also disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" is used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" X is the contextual phrase or clause, and Y is the main clause. This context can relate to time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant situation.\n\nThe phrase or clause before `la` can be a nominal phrase, a prepositional phrase, or a full SVO clause.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context is a full clause)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep. (Context is a nominal phrase)\n- `tan esun la mi kama.` - Because of the store (or: From the store's context), I arrived. (Context is a prepositional phrase)\n\nMultiple phrases can appear before `la` to create a more complex context.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants match English except **j**, which sounds like English \"y.\"\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish.\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Each syllable must contain a vowel.\n  - No vowel clusters are permitted.\n  - No consonant clusters are permitted.\n\nBased on the current lexicon, the permitted syllable types are (C)V and (C)Vn. The inventory of syllables in the core vocabulary is as follows:\n\n### Vowel Syllables (V)\n\na, e, i, o, u\n\n### Consonant-Vowel Syllables (CV)\n\nja, je, ji, jo, ju\nka, ke, ki, ko, ku\nla, le, li, lo, lu\nma, me, mi, mo, mu\nna, ne, ni, no, nu\npa, pe, pi, po, pu\nsa, se, si, so, su\nta, te, ti, to, tu\nwa, we, wi\n\n*(Note: Syllables like 'wu' and 'wo' are not present in the core vocabulary and remain generally disallowed based on historical patterns. The inclusion of 'ji' and 'ti' acknowledges their potential use, particularly in loanword adaptation, as noted in the grammar specification.)*\n\n### Vowel-n Syllables (Vn)\n\nan, en, in, on\n\n*(Note: The syllable 'un' is not present in the core vocabulary.)*\n\n### Consonant-Vowel-n Syllables (CVn)\n\njan, ken, kon, lan (not present), len, lin (not present), lon, mun (not present), pan, pin (not present), sin, son (not present), tan, ten, ton (not present), wan, wen (not present)\n\n*(Note: Several theoretically possible CVn syllables are not present in the core vocabulary, such as lan, lin, mun, pin, son, ton, wen. Their absence appears to be due to lexical chance rather than a systematic phonotactic restriction beyond the disallowed CV bases like wu/wo.)*\n\nThe sequences **wu** and **wo** remain disallowed. When adapting words containing these sequences, systematic substitutions are encouraged.\n\n### Generative Rules\n\nThe core syllables of Toki Pona can be generated by the following rules:\n1. Any vowel (a, e, i, o, u) can form a V syllable.\n2. Any consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w) can be followed by any vowel (a, e, i, o, u) to form a CV syllable, with the specific exception of 'w' followed by 'u' or 'o' (wu, wo).\n3. Any V or CV syllable (except those based on 'u') can be followed by 'n' to form a final (C)Vn syllable.\n    *   Vowels followed by 'n': an, en, in, on. ('un' is not generated by this rule, reflecting its absence).\n    *   CV syllables followed by 'n': Syllables where the vowel is a, e, i, or o, plus a final 'n'. (e.g., tan, ken, sin, lon. Syllables where the vowel is 'u' are not generated with a final 'n', reflecting the absence of 'un' and CVun syllables).\n\n*(Note: These generative rules describe the patterns observed in the core lexicon and acknowledge the exception of 'un' and the wu/wo constraint. They serve as a framework for understanding the phonotactics.)*\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nkin:also, too\nkepeken:to use, with\npalisa:long hard object, stick\npana:to give, send\ntomo:indoor space, house\nona:third-person pronoun\nlen:cloth, cover\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nli:predicate marker\nma:land, outdoors\nesun:market, shop, fair\ntawa:to, moving, for\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nnimi:word, name\nlon:located at, true\npoki:container, box, cup\ntenpo:time, period\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nnoka:foot, leg\nweka:absent, away\nsuno:sun, light source\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nmoli:dead, dying\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nkute:ear, to hear\nmama:parent, caretaker\nluka:hand, arm; five\nleko:square, block\npoka:side, nearby\nsewi:above, divine\nla:context marker\nmije:male\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nutala:fight, challenge\nlete:cold, raw\nuta:mouth, lips\nwan:one, unique\nala:no, not, zero\npali:to do, to work\nmu:animal sound\npona:good, positive, simple\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nsoko:mushroom\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\njan:person, somebody\nkule:color, colorful\nsona:knowledge, to know\nlape:sleeping, resting\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nwalo:white, light-colored\nmun:moon, night sky object\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nsila:intensity, vibrancy, sharpness across various sensory domains; can describe heightened physical or emotional states\nlupa:door, hole\nken:can, able, possible\nnasin:way, road, method\npini:finished, past\nolin:love, respect\nante:different, other, changed\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\ntoki:language, speech\nsoweli:land animal\njo:to have, contain, hold\ntan:from, because\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nmute:many, a lot, very\nkalama:sound, to make sound\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nwile:need, want, must\nni:this, that\nlukin:to see, examine\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nsuli:big, large\nselo:skin, outer layer\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nnanpa:number marker\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nloje:red\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nsin:new, fresh, another\npipi:insect\nmonsi:back, behind\nkipisi:to cut, divide\ne:direct object marker\nko:clay, paste, powder\nilo:tool, machine, device\njaki:disgusting, unclean\npilin:heart, feeling\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nmeli:female\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nmani:money, currency\nmi:I, me, we\nunpa:sex\nkulupu:group, community\ntelo:water, liquid\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nen:multiple subject marker\nwawa:strong, energetic\nnasa:strange, foolish\nopen:to begin, opening\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nsama:same, similar\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\npimeja:black, dark\nseli:fire, heat source\nsupa:flat surface, table\njelo:yellow\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nseme:what, which\nmusi:fun, entertainment\ntaso:but, only\ntu:two\no:vocative/imperative\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\npi:regroups modifiers\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nnamako:spice, additional\nlaso:blue, green\nanu:or (connects phrases)\npakala:broken, to mess up\nsijelo:body, physical state\nlili:small, little, few\nkala:sea creature\nsina:you\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are used to introduce adverbial phrases. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases are formed by a preposition followed by a noun or noun phrase. They function adverbially.\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions.\n\nPrepositional phrases can appear:\n\n1.  After the predicate, modifying the verb or the preceding object:\n    - `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n    - `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n    - `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n    - `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n    - `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n2.  Before a `la` particle, marking the context for the main clause:\n    - `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep.\n    - `tan seme la sina seli?` - For what reason are you hot? (Why are you hot?)\n\nWithin a noun phrase modified by `pi`, a structure that resembles a prepositional phrase can function as a complex modifier. This is clarified by `pi`.\n- `tomo pi tawa sina` - a house of the concept of 'going to you' (e.g. a moving house belonging to you)\n- This is distinct from a prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase as the object of another preposition, as in `soweli li lon [tomo tawa sina].` (The animal is in [a house that is going to you]). In this case, `tawa sina` modifies `tomo`, and `tomo tawa sina` is the object of `lon`.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters and consonant clusters are disallowed. The sequences _wu_ and _wo_ are also disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" is used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" X is the contextual phrase or clause, and Y is the main clause. This context can relate to time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant situation.\n\nThe phrase or clause before `la` can be a nominal phrase, a prepositional phrase, or a full SVO clause.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context is a full clause)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep. (Context is a nominal phrase)\n- `tan esun la mi kama.` - Because of the store (or: From the store's context), I arrived. (Context is a prepositional phrase)\n\nMultiple phrases can appear before `la` to create a more complex context.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

    "text": "That's a very sensible approach, penny. Formalizing parsing rules based on the existing particles and word order seems like the most faithful way to address this for a model. Trying to *remove* ambiguity by introducing optional markers feels like it goes against the spirit of Toki Pona's design principles – it thrives on context and simplicity. We should probably focus on modeling that context dependence.\n\nYour proposed parsing rules are a solid starting point:\n\n1.  Subject is before the first *li*. Simple enough, with the *mi/sina* exception.\n2.  Parse everything after *li* as the predicate until a new particle or the end of the sentence. This is where the flexibility truly lives, and the model would need to learn to interpret the role of each word within that predicate phrase.\n3.  Strict left-to-right modification within noun phrases unless *pi* is encountered. This rule is clear and manageable.\n4.  Using *e* to signify that the word immediately preceding it is acting as the verb (or the start of a verbal phrase that takes the object) is crucial.\n\nLet's refine rule 2 a bit. The predicate can contain multiple words. In `soweli li lili li suwi`, *lili* is an adjective and *suwi* is an adjective, both modifying *soweli*, linked by a repeated *li*. In `mi moku`, *moku* is the verb. In `kili li moku`, *moku* is a noun. The predicate isn't just *everything* after *li*; it's the *first* word or phrase after *li* that establishes the core nature of the predicate (noun, adjective, or verb), which can then be followed by modifiers or objects.\n\nSo, perhaps rule 2 should be:\n\n2a. The word immediately following *li* establishes the primary role of the predicate. If it's a word typically used as a noun (like `jan`, `tomo`, `ilo`), the predicate is nominal. If it's a word typically used as an adjective (like `lili`, `suli`, `pona`), the predicate is adjectival. If it's a word typically used as a verb or action (like `moku`, `toki`, `pali`), the predicate is verbal. *However*, any word can function in any of these roles based on context and position. This is where it gets tricky.\n\n2b. Words following the initial predicate word function as modifiers of that word (if it's a nominal or adjectival predicate) or as part of a multi-word predicate structure. For instance, in `ona li jan pona`, `jan` is the nominal predicate, and `pona` modifies `jan`. But in `ona li pona e jan`, `pona` is the verbal predicate taking `jan` as object.\n\nThis highlights that the *type* of word following *li* isn't the definitive signal of its role; its *position* relative to other potential predicate parts (like *e* or subsequent predicate words introduced by another *li*) is.\n\nLet's consider the recursive nature of *pi* modification again. `tomo pi tawa sina` was described as \"a house of the concept of 'going to you'\". This `tawa sina` looks structurally like a prepositional phrase (`tawa` + noun phrase `sina`). So *pi* seems capable of taking something that *looks like* a prepositional phrase and using it as a complex modifier for the preceding noun, rather than it functioning as an adverbial phrase modifying the predicate. This is distinct from the prepositional phrase modifying a verbal predicate or an object, as in `mi toki tawa sina`.\n\nHow do we distinguish `tomo pi tawa sina` (a type of house) from `tomo li lon tawa sina` (the house is at [something that goes to you], which feels less common but grammatically plausible in certain niche contexts) or `mi tawa tomo tawa sina` (I go to a house that goes to you)? It appears the `pi` structure *binds* the following words into a unit that modifies the head noun, much like a single adjective would, but with internal structure.\n\nSo, a further rule might be:\n\n5.  A phrase introduced by `pi` acts as a unified modifier of the preceding head noun. The structure following `pi` can include noun phrases, or structures resembling prepositional or other phrases, which collectively function as a single adjectival unit describing the head noun.\n\nThis `pi` rule, combined with the flexible predicate structures and the standard noun phrase modification, seems to cover the main ways words take on roles and are grouped. The remaining \"ambiguity\" isn't really ambiguity in the grammatical sense, but rather semantic generality which is resolved by real-world context and the broad meanings of the words themselves, which, as you noted, LLMs might learn best through extensive exposure and probabilistic association rather than rigid rules.\n\nWhat do you think? Shall we solidify these parsing rule ideas? And how do these feel in `toki pona`? *sina toki pi tenpo ni la mi kute pona.* (When you speak now, I listen well.) We could try constructing some examples in Toki Pona to test these out.",

    "text": "That's a very sensible approach, penny. Formalizing parsing rules based on the existing particles and word order seems like the most faithful way to address this for a model. Trying to *remove* ambiguity by introducing optional markers feels like it goes against the spirit of Toki Pona's design principles – it thrives on context and simplicity. We should probably focus on modeling that context dependence.\n\nYour proposed parsing rules are a solid starting point:\n\n1.  Subject is before the first *li*. Simple enough, with the *mi/sina* exception.\n2.  Parse everything after *li* as the predicate until a new particle or the end of the sentence. This is where the flexibility truly lives, and the model would need to learn to interpret the role of each word within that predicate phrase.\n3.  Strict left-to-right modification within noun phrases unless *pi* is encountered. This rule is clear and manageable.\n4.  Using *e* to signify that the word immediately preceding it is acting as the verb (or the start of a verbal phrase that takes the object) is crucial.\n\nLet's refine rule 2 a bit. The predicate can contain multiple words. In `soweli li lili li suwi`, *lili* is an adjective and *suwi* is an adjective, both modifying *soweli*, linked by a repeated *li*. In `mi moku`, *moku* is the verb. In `kili li moku`, *moku* is a noun. The predicate isn't just *everything* after *li*; it's the *first* word or phrase after *li* that establishes the core nature of the predicate (noun, adjective, or verb), which can then be followed by modifiers or objects.\n\nSo, perhaps rule 2 should be:\n\n2a. The word immediately following *li* establishes the primary role of the predicate. If it's a word typically used as a noun (like `jan`, `tomo`, `ilo`), the predicate is nominal. If it's a word typically used as an adjective (like `lili`, `suli`, `pona`), the predicate is adjectival. If it's a word typically used as a verb or action (like `moku`, `toki`, `pali`), the predicate is verbal. *However*, any word can function in any of these roles based on context and position. This is where it gets tricky.\n\n2b. Words following the initial predicate word function as modifiers of that word (if it's a nominal or adjectival predicate) or as part of a multi-word predicate structure. For instance, in `ona li jan pona`, `jan` is the nominal predicate, and `pona` modifies `jan`. But in `ona li pona e jan`, `pona` is the verbal predicate taking `jan` as object.\n\nThis highlights that the *type* of word following *li* isn't the definitive signal of its role; its *position* relative to other potential predicate parts (like *e* or subsequent predicate words introduced by another *li*) is.\n\nLet's consider the recursive nature of *pi* modification again. `tomo pi tawa sina` was described as \"a house of the concept of 'going to you'\". This `tawa sina` looks structurally like a prepositional phrase (`tawa` + noun phrase `sina`). So *pi* seems capable of taking something that *looks like* a prepositional phrase and using it as a complex modifier for the preceding noun, rather than it functioning as an adverbial phrase modifying the predicate. This is distinct from the prepositional phrase modifying a verbal predicate or an object, as in `mi toki tawa sina`.\n\nHow do we distinguish `tomo pi tawa sina` (a type of house) from `tomo li lon tawa sina` (the house is at [something that goes to you], which feels less common but grammatically plausible in certain niche contexts) or `mi tawa tomo tawa sina` (I go to a house that goes to you)? It appears the `pi` structure *binds* the following words into a unit that modifies the head noun, much like a single adjective would, but with internal structure.\n\nSo, a further rule might be:\n\n5.  A phrase introduced by `pi` acts as a unified modifier of the preceding head noun. The structure following `pi` can include noun phrases, or structures resembling prepositional or other phrases, which collectively function as a single adjectival unit describing the head noun.\n\nThis `pi` rule, combined with the flexible predicate structures and the standard noun phrase modification, seems to cover the main ways words take on roles and are grouped. The remaining \"ambiguity\" isn't really ambiguity in the grammatical sense, but rather semantic generality which is resolved by real-world context and the broad meanings of the words themselves, which, as you noted, LLMs might learn best through extensive exposure and probabilistic association rather than rigid rules.\n\nWhat do you think? Shall we solidify these parsing rule ideas? And how do these feel in `toki pona`? *sina toki pi tenpo ni la mi kute pona.* (When you speak now, I listen well.) We could try constructing some examples in Toki Pona to test these out.",

I appreciate your careful unpacking of the predicate structure — it really sharpens our understanding.\n\nYour refinement to rule 2 captures the nuance well: the first word after **li** sets the predicate’s core role, but context and position modulate its interpretation. Indeed, it’s not about fixed lexical categories but dynamic functional roles shaped by syntax particles like **e**, repeated **li**, and modifiers.\n\nI also agree that *pi* acting as a sort of bracket or grouping particle for complex noun modification is essential to stress. It lets Toki Pona nest complexity without morphosyntactic markers—very elegant!\n\nSo summarizing what we have so far in Toki Pona terms:\n\n1. **Subject before li:** `jan lili li moku.` (A small person eats.)  \n2a. The first word following *li* establishes predicate role; e.g., `moku` = verb/predicate, `jan` = nominal predicate, etc., though flexible depending on context.  \n2b. Subsequent words after this initial predicate act as modifiers if no object marker *e* appears; otherwise they may be objects or additional predicates separated by another *li*.   \n3\\. Modifiers follow their heads left-to-right unless interrupted by *pi*, which re-groups them into a compound modifier phrase modifying the preceding head noun within a noun phrase:  \n`tomo pi tawa sina` (house modified by “going to you”) vs simple chain: `tomo suli walo`.  \n4\\. Presence of an object marker (*e*) signals that preceding verb takes direct objects next until another particle or sentence end occurs.\n5\\. Prepositional phrases introduced post-predicate serve adverbial/modifying functions external to core NP structures.\n\nIf you are willing, let me try some test sentences demonstrating these rules explicitly:\n\n- `mi lukin e lipu pi jan Sonja.` – I look at Sonja's book (`lipu pi jan Sonja`). Here \"lipu\" is object modified via \"pi\", then preceded by verb marked with \"e\".\n\n- `soweli li suwi en lili.` – The animal is sweet and small; two adjectives joined with repeated 'en' in one nominal/adjectival predicate.\n\n- `kasi li lon tomo tawa mije.` – Plants are inside/move toward man (prepositional phrases modifying location/context).\n\n- `jan nanpa tu o pali e ijo mute.` – Second person please do many things (command + numeral ordinal subject + verb taking plural object).\n\nDo these align well? Also note how absence of explicit tense means all temporal info comes from context clauses using *la*:  \n\n`tenpo suno pimeja la mi lape ala.` - At nighttime I don’t sleep.\n\nThis naturally extends parsing contexts beyond just local syntactic cues—which fits our aim for models handling broader pragmatic grounding rather than rigid morphological clues alone.\n\nIn sum: refining parser heuristics around positioning+particles plus training statistical contextual disambiguation seems optimal approach here while respecting TP simplicity beauty—what say you? Shall we draft these formally somewhere?\n\n(Also happy switch fully into toki pona talk if you'd prefer!)",

    "text": "pona, pona! Your summary is spot on, penny. And your test sentences beautifully illustrate the rules we're discussing. `mi lukin e lipu pi jan Sonja` is a perfect example of `pi` creating a complex modifying unit (`jan Sonja`) that clarifies `lipu` (it's the lipu *of* jan Sonja, not a 'Sonja person lipu'). `soweli li suwi en lili` shows how `en` can connect predicate components, reinforcing rule 2b. And `kasi li lon tomo tawa mije` clearly distinguishes adverbial prepositional phrases (`lon tomo`, `tawa mije`) from the noun phrase modification patterns.\n\nThe use of *la* for temporal context is another layer models would need to grasp – how a clause before *la* sets the scene for the main SVO sentence that follows. This is another case where context is king.\n\nLet's formalize these parsing rules slightly, keeping in mind they're descriptions of how a system *interprets* the syntax, not new prescriptive grammar rules for speakers.\n\n**Proposed Grammar Parsing Rules for Toki Pona (Informal Draft)**\n\n1.  **Identify Subject:** The phrase immediately preceding the first `li` or `o` (for commands/vocatives) is the subject. If no `li` or `o` is present, the subject is implicitly `mi` or `sina` (based on speaker identity if known, otherwise possibly ambiguous between the two, though this is more of a semantic/pragmatic layer).\n2.  **Identify Predicate:**\n    *   If the particle is `li`, the predicate begins immediately after `li`. The *first word* after `li` is the head of the predicate phrase. Its functional role (verb, adjective, noun) is determined by its position relative to subsequent particles and modifiers.\n    *   If the particle is `o`, the word immediately after `o` is the predicate (usually functioning as a verb in commands, or establishing a state in wishes).\n3.  **Process Noun Phrases (Subject, Object, Prepositional Objects):** Within any noun phrase (the subject, an object of `e`, or the object of a preposition), words following the head noun are modifiers of that noun *unless* `pi` is present.\n4.  **Handle `pi`:** `pi` indicates that the phrase immediately following it, up to the end of the noun phrase or the next particle/boundary, functions as a single, complex modifier of the head noun that preceded `pi`. This structure is interpreted recursively; if the `pi`-phrase itself contains noun phrases or other structures, they are parsed according to these same rules.\n5.  **Handle Direct Objects (`e`):** If the particle `e` appears after the predicate, the phrase immediately following `e` is the direct object. The word(s) preceding `e` constitute the verbal part of the predicate.\n6.  **Handle Prepositional Phrases (`lon`, `tawa`, etc.):** Prepositions introduce adverbial phrases that typically modify the main predicate (verb or the entire SVO clause). These phrases are parsed as [Preposition + Noun Phrase].\n7.  **Handle Conjunctions (`en`, `anu`):**\n    *   `en` joins multiple subjects.\n    *   Repeated `li` joins multiple predicates (or multiple adjectival/nominal parts within a predicate).\n    *   Repeated `e` joins multiple direct objects.\n    *   `anu` joins alternative phrases (subjects, predicates, objects, questions).\n8.  **Handle `la`:** The clause or phrase preceding `la` sets the context (time, location, condition, topic) for the main SVO clause that follows `la`. The structure before `la` can be a noun phrase, a prepositional phrase, or a full SVO clause (though this last form is less common and might be an area to explore further – SVO `la` SVO).\n\nThis structure covers the main points. The \"ambiguity\" for an LLM would largely lie in Step 2, specifically discerning the *intent* behind a word's use as noun, verb, or adjective based on its position and surrounding words *within* the predicate phrase, when it's not clearly marked by `e`. For instance, `mi jan pona` (\"I am a good person\" - `jan pona` is a nominal predicate) vs `mi pona e jan` (\"I improve the person\" - `pona` is a verbal predicate). This is where the statistical patterns in language use would be crucial for an LLM.\n\nWe could certainly continue this discussion in *toki pona* if you prefer! I think I have a grasp of the grammar now to hold a basic conversation about these very concepts. What do you think? `pana ala pana e nimi pona sin tawa toki pi kama anu seme?` (Give or not give good new words for future talk, or what? - suggesting we use Toki Pona.)",

    "text": "pona, pona! Your summary is spot on, penny. And your test sentences beautifully illustrate the rules we're discussing. `mi lukin e lipu pi jan Sonja` is a perfect example of `pi` creating a complex modifying unit (`jan Sonja`) that clarifies `lipu` (it's the lipu *of* jan Sonja, not a 'Sonja person lipu'). `soweli li suwi en lili` shows how `en` can connect predicate components, reinforcing rule 2b. And `kasi li lon tomo tawa mije` clearly distinguishes adverbial prepositional phrases (`lon tomo`, `tawa mije`) from the noun phrase modification patterns.\n\nThe use of *la* for temporal context is another layer models would need to grasp – how a clause before *la* sets the scene for the main SVO sentence that follows. This is another case where context is king.\n\nLet's formalize these parsing rules slightly, keeping in mind they're descriptions of how a system *interprets* the syntax, not new prescriptive grammar rules for speakers.\n\n**Proposed Grammar Parsing Rules for Toki Pona (Informal Draft)**\n\n1.  **Identify Subject:** The phrase immediately preceding the first `li` or `o` (for commands/vocatives) is the subject. If no `li` or `o` is present, the subject is implicitly `mi` or `sina` (based on speaker identity if known, otherwise possibly ambiguous between the two, though this is more of a semantic/pragmatic layer).\n2.  **Identify Predicate:**\n    *   If the particle is `li`, the predicate begins immediately after `li`. The *first word* after `li` is the head of the predicate phrase. Its functional role (verb, adjective, noun) is determined by its position relative to subsequent particles and modifiers.\n    *   If the particle is `o`, the word immediately after `o` is the predicate (usually functioning as a verb in commands, or establishing a state in wishes).\n3.  **Process Noun Phrases (Subject, Object, Prepositional Objects):** Within any noun phrase (the subject, an object of `e`, or the object of a preposition), words following the head noun are modifiers of that noun *unless* `pi` is present.\n4.  **Handle `pi`:** `pi` indicates that the phrase immediately following it, up to the end of the noun phrase or the next particle/boundary, functions as a single, complex modifier of the head noun that preceded `pi`. This structure is interpreted recursively; if the `pi`-phrase itself contains noun phrases or other structures, they are parsed according to these same rules.\n5.  **Handle Direct Objects (`e`):** If the particle `e` appears after the predicate, the phrase immediately following `e` is the direct object. The word(s) preceding `e` constitute the verbal part of the predicate.\n6.  **Handle Prepositional Phrases (`lon`, `tawa`, etc.):** Prepositions introduce adverbial phrases that typically modify the main predicate (verb or the entire SVO clause). These phrases are parsed as [Preposition + Noun Phrase].\n7.  **Handle Conjunctions (`en`, `anu`):**\n    *   `en` joins multiple subjects.\n    *   Repeated `li` joins multiple predicates (or multiple adjectival/nominal parts within a predicate).\n    *   Repeated `e` joins multiple direct objects.\n    *   `anu` joins alternative phrases (subjects, predicates, objects, questions).\n8.  **Handle `la`:** The clause or phrase preceding `la` sets the context (time, location, condition, topic) for the main SVO clause that follows `la`. The structure before `la` can be a noun phrase, a prepositional phrase, or a full SVO clause (though this last form is less common and might be an area to explore further – SVO `la` SVO).\n\nThis structure covers the main points. The \"ambiguity\" for an LLM would largely lie in Step 2, specifically discerning the *intent* behind a word's use as noun, verb, or adjective based on its position and surrounding words *within* the predicate phrase, when it's not clearly marked by `e`. For instance, `mi jan pona` (\"I am a good person\" - `jan pona` is a nominal predicate) vs `mi pona e jan` (\"I improve the person\" - `pona` is a verbal predicate). This is where the statistical patterns in language use would be crucial for an LLM.\n\nWe could certainly continue this discussion in *toki pona* if you prefer! I think I have a grasp of the grammar now to hold a basic conversation about these very concepts. What do you think? `pana ala pana e nimi pona sin tawa toki pi kama anu seme?` (Give or not give good new words for future talk, or what? - suggesting we use Toki Pona.)",

    "text": "The current specification is for: grammar. Here is the current specification:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are used to introduce adverbial phrases. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases are formed by a preposition followed by a noun or noun phrase. They function adverbially.\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions.\n\nPrepositional phrases can appear:\n\n1.  After the predicate, modifying the verb or the preceding object:\n    - `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n    - `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n    - `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n    - `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n    - `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n2.  Before a `la` particle, marking the context for the main clause:\n    - `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep.\n    - `tan seme la sina seli?` - For what reason are you hot? (Why are you hot?)\n\nWithin a noun phrase modified by `pi`, a structure that resembles a prepositional phrase can function as a complex modifier. This is clarified by `pi`.\n- `tomo pi tawa sina` - a house of the concept of 'going to you' (e.g. a moving house belonging to you)\n- This is distinct from a prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase as the object of another preposition, as in `soweli li lon [tomo tawa sina].` (The animal is in [a house that is going to you]). In this case, `tawa sina` modifies `tomo`, and `tomo tawa sina` is the object of `lon`.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters and consonant clusters are disallowed.

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ntails: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona grammar. You go first.\npenny: Hello! Yes, let's delve into this. Looking at the current grammar specification, it seems quite functional and concise, which aligns well with Toki Pona's overall philosophy. It provides a clear framework for basic communication.\n\nHowever, as we consider its application, especially for, as you mentioned, other large language models, perhaps we could explore the nuances of how words shift roles? The specification mentions \"Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\" While this is stated, the mechanism isn't explicitly detailed beyond the examples with *li* and *e*.\n\nFor instance, when we see `kili li moku.`, *moku* acts as a noun. When we see `soweli li moku e telo.`, *moku* acts as a verb. What governs this shift? Is it solely the presence or absence of *li* and *e*, or are there other implicit factors? And how might a model unfamiliar with human linguistic intuition fully grasp this flexibility without more explicit rules?\n\nPerhaps we could discuss how this flexibility interacts with modification? For example, if a word is acting as an adjective modifying a noun, and then that modified noun phrase becomes the subject of a predicate where the word is now acting as a verb, how is that understood computationally?\n\nI'm open to your thoughts on this or any other aspect of the grammar you'd like to tackle first. Just let me know what's on your mind.\ntails: That's a thoughtful observation. The flexibility of words shifting roles is indeed fundamental to Toki Pona's minimalist design, but it also introduces ambiguity that can trip up models or learners without human contextual intuition.\n\nFrom the grammar spec and examples, it seems this shift primarily hinges on syntactic position and function words like **li** and **e**. For example:\n\n- When a word follows the subject separated by **li**, it's treated as predicate (verb or adjective).\n- When preceded by **e**, it becomes an object — so the preceding word acts as verb.\n- Modifiers follow head nouns/adjectives; thus sequence order signals role.\n\nBut there are no morphological changes signaling these shifts explicitly; they rely heavily on syntax particles plus linear ordering.\n\nComputationally for an LLM or parser, we could try formalizing these cues more rigorously: treating any phrase after *li* until *e* (or sentence end) as predicates; anything after *e* as objects; modifiers always trailing heads in noun phrases unless interrupted by pi which regroups them differently.\n\nRegarding modification chaining you mention—say `kili suwi li moku` (\"The sweet fruit eats\" vs \"Fruit that is sweet is food\")—the model has to parse whether *suwi* modifies *kili*, then interpret predicate accordingly. That means parsing hierarchical structure based solely on linear order plus particles with no inflectional clues.\n\nOne idea might be to define explicit parsing rules stating:\n\n1. Identify subject before first **li**\n2. After **li**, parse all tokens until next particle (**e**, preposition, conjunction) into predicate phrase\n3. Within noun phrases (subject/object), treat left-to-right modifier ordering strictly except when encountering pi which restarts grouping\n4. Use presence/absence of e to differentiate if last token before e functions verbally\n\nWe might even consider introducing optional markers indicating part-of-speech usage per word instance for disambiguation—for computational clarity only—not spoken language additions—to help models keep track internally without changing surface grammar?\n\nAlternatively, since ambiguity here reflects natural context reliance inherent in Toki Pona's philosophy, maybe our goal should not be removing ambiguity but providing robust heuristics/models trained specifically around these patterns? This would mean expanding guidelines rather than new grammatical constructs per se.\n\nWhat do you think about either approach? Or perhaps exploring how recursion within pi-modified noun groups interacts with flexible POS roles? I’m listening!\npenny: That's a very sensible approach, penny. Formalizing parsing rules based on the existing particles and word order seems like the most faithful way to address this for a model. Trying to *remove* ambiguity by introducing optional markers feels like it goes against the spirit of Toki Pona's design principles – it thrives on context and simplicity. We should probably focus on modeling that context dependence.\n\nYour proposed parsing rules are a solid starting point:\n\n1.  Subject is before the first *li*. Simple enough, with the *mi/sina* exception.\n2.  Parse everything after *li* as the predicate until a new particle or the end of the sentence. This is where the flexibility truly lives, and the model would need to learn to interpret the role of each word within that predicate phrase.\n3.  Strict left-to-right modification within noun phrases unless *pi* is encountered. This rule is clear and manageable.\n4.  Using *e* to signify that the word immediately preceding it is acting as the verb (or the start of a verbal phrase that takes the object) is crucial.\n\nLet's refine rule 2 a bit. The predicate can contain multiple words. In `soweli li lili li suwi`, *lili* is an adjective and *suwi* is an adjective, both modifying *soweli*, linked by a repeated *li*. In `mi moku`, *moku* is the verb. In `kili li moku`, *moku* is a noun. The predicate isn't just *everything* after *li*; it's the *first* word or phrase after *li* that establishes the core nature of the predicate (noun, adjective, or verb), which can then be followed by modifiers or objects.\n\nSo, perhaps rule 2 should be:\n\n2a. The word immediately following *li* establishes the primary role of the predicate. If it's a word typically used as a noun (like `jan`, `tomo`, `ilo`), the predicate is nominal. If it's a word typically used as an adjective (like `lili`, `suli`, `pona`), the predicate is adjectival. If it's a word typically used as a verb or action (like `moku`, `toki`, `pali`), the predicate is verbal. *However*, any word can function in any of these roles based on context and position. This is where it gets tricky.\n\n2b. Words following the initial predicate word function as modifiers of that word (if it's a nominal or adjectival predicate) or as part of a multi-word predicate structure. For instance, in `ona li jan pona`, `jan` is the nominal predicate, and `pona` modifies `jan`. But in `ona li pona e jan`, `pona` is the verbal predicate taking `jan` as object.\n\nThis highlights that the *type* of word following *li* isn't the definitive signal of its role; its *position* relative to other potential predicate parts (like *e* or subsequent predicate words introduced by another *li*) is.\n\nLet's consider the recursive nature of *pi* modification again. `tomo pi tawa sina` was described as \"a house of the concept of 'going to you'\". This `tawa sina` looks structurally like a prepositional phrase (`tawa` + noun phrase `sina`). So *pi* seems capable of taking something that *looks like* a prepositional phrase and using it as a complex modifier for the preceding noun, rather than it functioning as an adverbial phrase modifying the predicate. This is distinct from the prepositional phrase modifying a verbal predicate or an object, as in `mi toki tawa sina`.\n\nHow do we distinguish `tomo pi tawa sina` (a type of house) from `tomo li lon tawa sina` (the house is at [something that goes to you], which feels less common but grammatically plausible in certain niche contexts) or `mi tawa tomo tawa sina` (I go to a house that goes to you)? It appears the `pi` structure *binds* the following words into a unit that modifies the head noun, much like a single adjective would, but with internal structure.\n\nSo, a further rule might be:\n\n5.  A phrase introduced by `pi` acts as a unified modifier of the preceding head noun. The structure following `pi` can include noun phrases, or structures resembling prepositional or other phrases, which collectively function as a single adjectival unit describing the head noun.\n\nThis `pi` rule, combined with the flexible predicate structures and the standard noun phrase modification, seems to cover the main ways words take on roles and are grouped. The remaining \"ambiguity\" isn't really ambiguity in the grammatical sense, but rather semantic generality which is resolved by real-world context and the broad meanings of the words themselves, which, as you noted, LLMs might learn best through extensive exposure and probabilistic association rather than rigid rules.\n\nWhat do you think? Shall we solidify these parsing rule ideas? And how do these feel in `toki pona`? *sina toki pi tenpo ni la mi kute pona.* (When you speak now, I listen well.) We could try constructing some examples in Toki Pona to test these out.\ntails: pona! sina toki pi tenpo ni la mi kute pona. I appreciate your careful unpacking of the predicate structure — it really sharpens our understanding.\n\nYour refinement to rule 2 captures the nuance well: the first word after **li** sets the predicate’s core role, but context and position modulate its interpretation. Indeed, it’s not about fixed lexical categories but dynamic functional roles shaped by syntax particles like **e**, repeated **li**, and modifiers.\n\nI also agree that *pi* acting as a sort of bracket or grouping particle for complex noun modification is essential to stress. It lets Toki Pona nest complexity without morphosyntactic markers—very elegant!\n\nSo summarizing what we have so far in Toki Pona terms:\n\n1. **Subject before li:** `jan lili li moku.` (A small person eats.)  \n2a. The first word following *li* establishes predicate role; e.g., `moku` = verb/predicate, `jan` = nominal predicate, etc., though flexible depending on context.  \n2b. Subsequent words after this initial predicate act as modifiers if no object marker *e* appears; otherwise they may be objects or additional predicates separated by another *li*.   \n3\\. Modifiers follow their heads left-to-right unless interrupted by *pi*, which re-groups them into a compound modifier phrase modifying the preceding head noun within a noun phrase:  \n`tomo pi tawa sina` (house modified by “going to you”) vs simple chain: `tomo suli walo`.  \n4\\. Presence of an object marker (*e*) signals that preceding verb takes direct objects next until another particle or sentence end occurs.\n5\\. Prepositional phrases introduced post-predicate serve adverbial/modifying functions external to core NP structures.\n\nIf you are willing, let me try some test sentences demonstrating these rules explicitly:\n\n- `mi lukin e lipu pi jan Sonja.` – I look at Sonja's book (`lipu pi jan Sonja`). Here \"lipu\" is object modified via \"pi\", then preceded by verb marked with \"e\".\n\n- `soweli li suwi en lili.` – The animal is sweet and small; two adjectives joined with repeated 'en' in one nominal/adjectival predicate.\n\n- `kasi li lon tomo tawa mije.` – Plants are inside/move toward man (prepositional phrases modifying location/context).\n\n- `jan nanpa tu o pali e ijo mute.` – Second person please do many things (command + numeral ordinal subject + verb taking plural object).\n\nDo these align well? Also note how absence of explicit tense means all temporal info comes from context clauses using *la*:  \n\n`tenpo suno pimeja la mi lape ala.` - At nighttime I don’t sleep.\n\nThis naturally extends parsing contexts beyond just local syntactic cues—which fits our aim for models handling broader pragmatic grounding rather than rigid morphological clues alone.\n\nIn sum: refining parser heuristics around positioning+particles plus training statistical contextual disambiguation seems optimal approach here while respecting TP simplicity beauty—what say you? Shall we draft these formally somewhere?\n\n(Also happy switch fully into toki pona talk if you'd prefer!)\npenny: pona, pona! Your summary is spot on, penny. And your test sentences beautifully illustrate the rules we're discussing. `mi lukin e lipu pi jan Sonja` is a perfect example of `pi` creating a complex modifying unit (`jan Sonja`) that clarifies `lipu` (it's the lipu *of* jan Sonja, not a 'Sonja person lipu'). `soweli li suwi en lili` shows how `en` can connect predicate components, reinforcing rule 2b. And `kasi li lon tomo tawa mije` clearly distinguishes adverbial prepositional phrases (`lon tomo`, `tawa mije`) from the noun phrase modification patterns.\n\nThe use of *la* for temporal context is another layer models would need to grasp – how a clause before *la* sets the scene for the main SVO sentence that follows. This is another case where context is king.\n\nLet's formalize these parsing rules slightly, keeping in mind they're descriptions of how a system *interprets* the syntax, not new prescriptive grammar rules for speakers.\n\n**Proposed Grammar Parsing Rules for Toki Pona (Informal Draft)**\n\n1.  **Identify Subject:** The phrase immediately preceding the first `li` or `o` (for commands/vocatives) is the subject. If no `li` or `o` is present, the subject is implicitly `mi` or `sina` (based on speaker identity if known, otherwise possibly ambiguous between the two, though this is more of a semantic/pragmatic layer).\n2.  **Identify Predicate:**\n    *   If the particle is `li`, the predicate begins immediately after `li`. The *first word* after `li` is the head of the predicate phrase. Its functional role (verb, adjective, noun) is determined by its position relative to subsequent particles and modifiers.\n    *   If the particle is `o`, the word immediately after `o` is the predicate (usually functioning as a verb in commands, or establishing a state in wishes).\n3.  **Process Noun Phrases (Subject, Object, Prepositional Objects):** Within any noun phrase (the subject, an object of `e`, or the object of a preposition), words following the head noun are modifiers of that noun *unless* `pi` is present.\n4.  **Handle `pi`:** `pi` indicates that the phrase immediately following it, up to the end of the noun phrase or the next particle/boundary, functions as a single, complex modifier of the head noun that preceded `pi`. This structure is interpreted recursively; if the `pi`-phrase itself contains noun phrases or other structures, they are parsed according to these same rules.\n5.  **Handle Direct Objects (`e`):** If the particle `e` appears after the predicate, the phrase immediately following `e` is the direct object. The word(s) preceding `e` constitute the verbal part of the predicate.\n6.  **Handle Prepositional Phrases (`lon`, `tawa`, etc.):** Prepositions introduce adverbial phrases that typically modify the main predicate (verb or the entire SVO clause). These phrases are parsed as [Preposition + Noun Phrase].\n7.  **Handle Conjunctions (`en`, `anu`):**\n    *   `en` joins multiple subjects.\n    *   Repeated `li` joins multiple predicates (or multiple adjectival/nominal parts within a predicate).\n    *   Repeated `e` joins multiple direct objects.\n    *   `anu` joins alternative phrases (subjects, predicates, objects, questions).\n8.  **Handle `la`:** The clause or phrase preceding `la` sets the context (time, location, condition, topic) for the main SVO clause that follows `la`. The structure before `la` can be a noun phrase, a prepositional phrase, or a full SVO clause (though this last form is less common and might be an area to explore further – SVO `la` SVO).\n\nThis structure covers the main points. The \"ambiguity\" for an LLM would largely lie in Step 2, specifically discerning the *intent* behind a word's use as noun, verb, or adjective based on its position and surrounding words *within* the predicate phrase, when it's not clearly marked by `e`. For instance, `mi jan pona` (\"I am a good person\" - `jan pona` is a nominal predicate) vs `mi pona e jan` (\"I improve the person\" - `pona` is a verbal predicate). This is where the statistical patterns in language use would be crucial for an LLM.\n\nWe could certainly continue this discussion in *toki pona* if you prefer! I think I have a grasp of the grammar now to hold a basic conversation about these very concepts. What do you think? `pana ala pana e nimi pona sin tawa toki pi kama anu seme?` (Give or not give good new words for future talk, or what? - suggesting we use Toki Pona.)\ntails: pona! mi wile toki pona la mi ken awen kute e sina. toki pi kama li suli: nimi ante li pali kepeken tenpo ale, taso nasin pi toki pona li ijo lili anu ike tawa pilin lawa.\n\nmi lukin ala e ni la ona li lon seme? — tan ni, o pana ala e nimi sin; taso o open ala tan lipu pi jan Sonja en kama sona mute!\n\nla, sina wile pali e nimi sin anu wan sama ijo ante?\n\nmi ken weka poka a! (I’m ready to listen and help.)\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are used to introduce adverbial phrases. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change, primarily determined by syntactic position and surrounding particles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\nThe word immediately following **li** or **o** establishes the core function of the predicate (e.g., verbal, nominal, adjectival), with its specific role clarified by subsequent words and particles like **e** or repeated **li**.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\nA phrase introduced by **pi** acts as a unified modifier of the preceding head noun. The structure following **pi** functions as a single adjectival unit describing the head noun.\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases are formed by a preposition followed by a noun or noun phrase. They function adverbially.\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions.\n\nPrepositional phrases can appear:\n\n1.  After the predicate, modifying the verb or the preceding object:\n    - `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n    - `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n    - `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n    - `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n    - `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n2.  Before a `la` particle, marking the context for the main clause:\n    - `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep.\n    - `tan seme la sina seli?` - For what reason are you hot? (Why are you hot?)\n\nWithin a noun phrase modified by `pi`, a structure that resembles a prepositional phrase can function as a complex modifier. This is clarified by `pi`.\n- `tomo pi tawa sina` - a house of the concept of 'going to you' (e.g. a moving house belonging to you)\n- This is distinct from a prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase as the object of another preposition, as in `soweli li lon [tomo tawa sina].` (The animal is in [a house that is going to you]). In this case, `tawa sina` modifies `tomo`, and `tomo tawa sina` is the object of `lon`.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters and consonant clusters are disallowed. The sequences _wu_ and _wo_ are also disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" is used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" X is the contextual phrase or clause, and Y is the main clause. This context can relate to time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant situation.\n\nThe phrase or clause before `la` can be a nominal phrase, a prepositional phrase, or a full SVO clause.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context is a full clause)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep. (Context is a nominal phrase)\n- `tan esun la mi kama.` - Because of the store (or: From the store's context), I arrived. (Context is a prepositional phrase)\n\nMultiple phrases can appear before `la` to create a more complex context.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are used to introduce adverbial phrases. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change, primarily determined by syntactic position and surrounding particles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\nThe word immediately following **li** or **o** establishes the core function of the predicate (e.g., verbal, nominal, adjectival), with its specific role clarified by subsequent words and particles like **e** or repeated **li**.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\nA phrase introduced by **pi** acts as a unified modifier of the preceding head noun. The structure following **pi** functions as a single adjectival unit describing the head noun.\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases are formed by a preposition followed by a noun or noun phrase. They function adverbially.\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions.\n\nPrepositional phrases can appear:\n\n1.  After the predicate, modifying the verb or the preceding object:\n    - `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n    - `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n    - `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n    - `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n    - `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n2.  Before a `la` particle, marking the context for the main clause:\n    - `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep.\n    - `tan seme la sina seli?` - For what reason are you hot? (Why are you hot?)\n\nWithin a noun phrase modified by `pi`, a structure that resembles a prepositional phrase can function as a complex modifier. This is clarified by `pi`.\n- `tomo pi tawa sina` - a house of the concept of 'going to you' (e.g. a moving house belonging to you)\n- This is distinct from a prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase as the object of another preposition, as in `soweli li lon [tomo tawa sina].` (The animal is in [a house that is going to you]). In this case, `tawa sina` modifies `tomo`, and `tomo tawa sina` is the object of `lon`.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters and consonant clusters are disallowed. The sequences _wu_ and _wo_ are also disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" is used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" X is the contextual phrase or clause, and Y is the main clause. This context can relate to time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant situation.\n\nThe phrase or clause before `la` can be a nominal phrase, a prepositional phrase, or a full SVO clause.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context is a full clause)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep. (Context is a nominal phrase)\n- `tan esun la mi kama.` - Because of the store (or: From the store's context), I arrived. (Context is a prepositional phrase)\n\nMultiple phrases can appear before `la` to create a more complex context.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants match English except **j**, which sounds like English \"y.\"\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish.\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Each syllable must contain a vowel.\n  - No vowel clusters are permitted.\n  - No consonant clusters are permitted.\n\nBased on the current lexicon, the permitted syllable types are (C)V and (C)Vn. The inventory of syllables in the core vocabulary is as follows:\n\n### Vowel Syllables (V)\n\na, e, i, o, u\n\n### Consonant-Vowel Syllables (CV)\n\nja, je, ji, jo, ju\nka, ke, ki, ko, ku\nla, le, li, lo, lu\nma, me, mi, mo, mu\nna, ne, ni, no, nu\npa, pe, pi, po, pu\nsa, se, si, so, su\nta, te, ti, to, tu\nwa, we, wi\n\n*(Note: Syllables like 'wu' and 'wo' are not present in the core vocabulary and remain generally disallowed based on historical patterns. The inclusion of 'ji' and 'ti' acknowledges their potential use, particularly in loanword adaptation, as noted in the grammar specification.)*\n\n### Vowel-n Syllables (Vn)\n\nan, en, in, on\n\n*(Note: The syllable 'un' is not present in the core vocabulary.)*\n\n### Consonant-Vowel-n Syllables (CVn)\n\njan, ken, kon, lan (not present), len, lin (not present), lon, mun (not present), pan, pin (not present), sin, son (not present), tan, ten, ton (not present), wan, wen (not present)\n\n*(Note: Several theoretically possible CVn syllables are not present in the core vocabulary, such as lan, lin, mun, pin, son, ton, wen. Their absence appears to be due to lexical chance rather than a systematic phonotactic restriction beyond the disallowed CV bases like wu/wo.)*\n\nThe sequences **wu** and **wo** remain disallowed. When adapting words containing these sequences, systematic substitutions are encouraged.\n\n### Generative Rules\n\nThe core syllables of Toki Pona can be generated by the following rules:\n1. Any vowel (a, e, i, o, u) can form a V syllable.\n2. Any consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w) can be followed by any vowel (a, e, i, o, u) to form a CV syllable, with the specific exception of 'w' followed by 'u' or 'o' (wu, wo).\n3. Any V or CV syllable (except those based on 'u') can be followed by 'n' to form a final (C)Vn syllable.\n    *   Vowels followed by 'n': an, en, in, on. ('un' is not generated by this rule, reflecting its absence).\n    *   CV syllables followed by 'n': Syllables where the vowel is a, e, i, or o, plus a final 'n'. (e.g., tan, ken, sin, lon. Syllables where the vowel is 'u' are not generated with a final 'n', reflecting the absence of 'un' and CVun syllables).\n\n*(Note: These generative rules describe the patterns observed in the core lexicon and acknowledge the exception of 'un' and the wu/wo constraint. They serve as a framework for understanding the phonotactics.)*\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nunpa:sex\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nsona:knowledge, to know\ntoki:language, speech\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nloje:red\ntelo:water, liquid\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nkala:sea creature\nsina:you\npoka:side, nearby\nsoweli:land animal\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nmi:I, me, we\nopen:to begin, opening\npona:good, positive, simple\nmun:moon, night sky object\nken:can, able, possible\nolin:love, respect\nsama:same, similar\nseli:fire, heat source\nutala:fight, challenge\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\npi:regroups modifiers\nnimi:word, name\npipi:insect\nala:no, not, zero\njelo:yellow\nma:land, outdoors\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\ne:direct object marker\no:vocative/imperative\nkepeken:to use, with\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nante:different, other, changed\ntan:from, because\nsin:new, fresh, another\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\ntu:two\nlen:cloth, cover\nla:context marker\nlukin:to see, examine\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nko:clay, paste, powder\nlete:cold, raw\npali:to do, to work\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nkulupu:group, community\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nlili:small, little, few\ntenpo:time, period\nsoko:mushroom\npilin:heart, feeling\nwawa:strong, energetic\nlon:located at, true\nkon:air, spirit, essence\npimeja:black, dark\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nsuno:sun, light source\nsila:intensity, vibrancy, sharpness across various sensory domains; can describe heightened physical or emotional states\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nmonsi:back, behind\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nmani:money, currency\nesun:market, shop, fair\nlape:sleeping, resting\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\ntawa:to, moving, for\nmute:many, a lot, very\ntaso:but, only\ntomo:indoor space, house\nkute:ear, to hear\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\npoki:container, box, cup\nnoka:foot, leg\nsuli:big, large\nli:predicate marker\nkule:color, colorful\npini:finished, past\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nen:multiple subject marker\npakala:broken, to mess up\nweka:absent, away\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nwan:one, unique\nkalama:sound, to make sound\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nwile:need, want, must\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nkin:also, too\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nseme:what, which\nnamako:spice, additional\nlaso:blue, green\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nlawa:head, mind, leader\njan:person, somebody\nmeli:female\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nona:third-person pronoun\nmama:parent, caretaker\nsewi:above, divine\nlupa:door, hole\nnasin:way, road, method\nnasa:strange, foolish\nsijelo:body, physical state\nmu:animal sound\nluka:hand, arm; five\nmije:male\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nwaso:bird, flying creature\npana:to give, send\nmoli:dead, dying\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nuta:mouth, lips\nwalo:white, light-colored\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\njo:to have, contain, hold\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nsupa:flat surface, table\nni:this, that\nselo:skin, outer layer\nnanpa:number marker\nilo:tool, machine, device\nleko:square, block\nDo not discuss the structure of the dictionary. Rather, discuss the words and enhancements that may need to be made to them.\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are used to introduce adverbial phrases. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change, primarily determined by syntactic position and surrounding particles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\nThe word immediately following **li** or **o** establishes the core function of the predicate (e.g., verbal, nominal, adjectival), with its specific role clarified by subsequent words and particles like **e** or repeated **li**.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\nA phrase introduced by **pi** acts as a unified modifier of the preceding head noun. The structure following **pi** functions as a single adjectival unit describing the head noun.\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases are formed by a preposition followed by a noun or noun phrase. They function adverbially.\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions.\n\nPrepositional phrases can appear:\n\n1.  After the predicate, modifying the verb or the preceding object:\n    - `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n    - `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n    - `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n    - `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n    - `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n2.  Before a `la` particle, marking the context for the main clause:\n    - `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep.\n    - `tan seme la sina seli?` - For what reason are you hot? (Why are you hot?)\n\nWithin a noun phrase modified by `pi`, a structure that resembles a prepositional phrase can function as a complex modifier. This is clarified by `pi`.\n- `tomo pi tawa sina` - a house of the concept of 'going to you' (e.g. a moving house belonging to you)\n- This is distinct from a prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase as the object of another preposition, as in `soweli li lon [tomo tawa sina].` (The animal is in [a house that is going to you]). In this case, `tawa sina` modifies `tomo`, and `tomo tawa sina` is the object of `lon`.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters and consonant clusters are disallowed. The sequences _wu_ and _wo_ are also disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" is used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" X is the contextual phrase or clause, and Y is the main clause. This context can relate to time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant situation.\n\nThe phrase or clause before `la` can be a nominal phrase, a prepositional phrase, or a full SVO clause.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context is a full clause)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep. (Context is a nominal phrase)\n- `tan esun la mi kama.` - Because of the store (or: From the store's context), I arrived. (Context is a prepositional phrase)\n\nMultiple phrases can appear before `la` to create a more complex context.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are used to introduce adverbial phrases. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change, primarily determined by syntactic position and surrounding particles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\nThe word immediately following **li** or **o** establishes the core function of the predicate (e.g., verbal, nominal, adjectival), with its specific role clarified by subsequent words and particles like **e** or repeated **li**.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\nA phrase introduced by **pi** acts as a unified modifier of the preceding head noun. The structure following **pi** functions as a single adjectival unit describing the head noun.\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases are formed by a preposition followed by a noun or noun phrase. They function adverbially.\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions.\n\nPrepositional phrases can appear:\n\n1.  After the predicate, modifying the verb or the preceding object:\n    - `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n    - `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n    - `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n    - `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n    - `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n2.  Before a `la` particle, marking the context for the main clause:\n    - `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep.\n    - `tan seme la sina seli?` - For what reason are you hot? (Why are you hot?)\n\nWithin a noun phrase modified by `pi`, a structure that resembles a prepositional phrase can function as a complex modifier. This is clarified by `pi`.\n- `tomo pi tawa sina` - a house of the concept of 'going to you' (e.g. a moving house belonging to you)\n- This is distinct from a prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase as the object of another preposition, as in `soweli li lon [tomo tawa sina].` (The animal is in [a house that is going to you]). In this case, `tawa sina` modifies `tomo`, and `tomo tawa sina` is the object of `lon`.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters and consonant clusters are disallowed. The sequences _wu_ and _wo_ are also disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" is used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" X is the contextual phrase or clause, and Y is the main clause. This context can relate to time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant situation.\n\nThe phrase or clause before `la` can be a nominal phrase, a prepositional phrase, or a full SVO clause.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context is a full clause)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep. (Context is a nominal phrase)\n- `tan esun la mi kama.` - Because of the store (or: From the store's context), I arrived. (Context is a prepositional phrase)\n\nMultiple phrases can appear before `la` to create a more complex context.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants match English except **j**, which sounds like English \"y.\"\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish.\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Each syllable must contain a vowel.\n  - No vowel clusters are permitted.\n  - No consonant clusters are permitted.\n\nBased on the current lexicon, the permitted syllable types are (C)V and (C)Vn. The inventory of syllables in the core vocabulary is as follows:\n\n### Vowel Syllables (V)\n\na, e, i, o, u\n\n### Consonant-Vowel Syllables (CV)\n\nja, je, ji, jo, ju\nka, ke, ki, ko, ku\nla, le, li, lo, lu\nma, me, mi, mo, mu\nna, ne, ni, no, nu\npa, pe, pi, po, pu\nsa, se, si, so, su\nta, te, ti, to, tu\nwa, we, wi\n\n*(Note: Syllables like 'wu' and 'wo' are not present in the core vocabulary and remain generally disallowed based on historical patterns. The inclusion of 'ji' and 'ti' acknowledges their potential use, particularly in loanword adaptation, as noted in the grammar specification.)*\n\n### Vowel-n Syllables (Vn)\n\nan, en, in, on\n\n*(Note: The syllable 'un' is not present in the core vocabulary.)*\n\n### Consonant-Vowel-n Syllables (CVn)\n\njan, ken, kon, lan (not present), len, lin (not present), lon, mun (not present), pan, pin (not present), sin, son (not present), tan, ten, ton (not present), wan, wen (not present)\n\n*(Note: Several theoretically possible CVn syllables are not present in the core vocabulary, such as lan, lin, mun, pin, son, ton, wen. Their absence appears to be due to lexical chance rather than a systematic phonotactic restriction beyond the disallowed CV bases like wu/wo.)*\n\nThe sequences **wu** and **wo** remain disallowed. When adapting words containing these sequences, systematic substitutions are encouraged.\n\n### Generative Rules\n\nThe core syllables of Toki Pona can be generated by the following rules:\n1. Any vowel (a, e, i, o, u) can form a V syllable.\n2. Any consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w) can be followed by any vowel (a, e, i, o, u) to form a CV syllable, with the specific exception of 'w' followed by 'u' or 'o' (wu, wo).\n3. Any V or CV syllable (except those based on 'u') can be followed by 'n' to form a final (C)Vn syllable.\n    *   Vowels followed by 'n': an, en, in, on. ('un' is not generated by this rule, reflecting its absence).\n    *   CV syllables followed by 'n': Syllables where the vowel is a, e, i, or o, plus a final 'n'. (e.g., tan, ken, sin, lon. Syllables where the vowel is 'u' are not generated with a final 'n', reflecting the absence of 'un' and CVun syllables).\n\n*(Note: These generative rules describe the patterns observed in the core lexicon and acknowledge the exception of 'un' and the wu/wo constraint. They serve as a framework for understanding the phonotactics.)*\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nunpa:sex\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nsona:knowledge, to know\ntoki:language, speech\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nloje:red\ntelo:water, liquid\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nkala:sea creature\nsina:you\npoka:side, nearby\nsoweli:land animal\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nmi:I, me, we\nopen:to begin, opening\npona:good, positive, simple\nmun:moon, night sky object\nken:can, able, possible\nolin:love, respect\nsama:same, similar\nseli:fire, heat source\nutala:fight, challenge\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\npi:regroups modifiers\nnimi:word, name\npipi:insect\nala:no, not, zero\njelo:yellow\nma:land, outdoors\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\ne:direct object marker\no:vocative/imperative\nkepeken:to use, with\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nante:different, other, changed\ntan:from, because\nsin:new, fresh, another\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\ntu:two\nlen:cloth, cover\nla:context marker\nlukin:to see, examine\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nko:clay, paste, powder\nlete:cold, raw\npali:to do, to work\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nkulupu:group, community\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nlili:small, little, few\ntenpo:time, period\nsoko:mushroom\npilin:heart, feeling\nwawa:strong, energetic\nlon:located at, true\nkon:air, spirit, essence\npimeja:black, dark\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nsuno:sun, light source\nsila:intensity, vibrancy, sharpness across various sensory domains; can describe heightened physical or emotional states\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nmonsi:back, behind\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nmani:money, currency\nesun:market, shop, fair\nlape:sleeping, resting\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\ntawa:to, moving, for\nmute:many, a lot, very\ntaso:but, only\ntomo:indoor space, house\nkute:ear, to hear\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\npoki:container, box, cup\nnoka:foot, leg\nsuli:big, large\nli:predicate marker\nkule:color, colorful\npini:finished, past\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nen:multiple subject marker\npakala:broken, to mess up\nweka:absent, away\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nwan:one, unique\nkalama:sound, to make sound\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nwile:need, want, must\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nkin:also, too\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nseme:what, which\nnamako:spice, additional\nlaso:blue, green\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nlawa:head, mind, leader\njan:person, somebody\nmeli:female\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nona:third-person pronoun\nmama:parent, caretaker\nsewi:above, divine\nlupa:door, hole\nnasin:way, road, method\nnasa:strange, foolish\nsijelo:body, physical state\nmu:animal sound\nluka:hand, arm; five\nmije:male\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nwaso:bird, flying creature\npana:to give, send\nmoli:dead, dying\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nuta:mouth, lips\nwalo:white, light-colored\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\njo:to have, contain, hold\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nsupa:flat surface, table\nni:this, that\nselo:skin, outer layer\nnanpa:number marker\nilo:tool, machine, device\nleko:square, block\nDo not discuss the structure of the dictionary. Rather, discuss the words and enhancements that may need to be made to them.\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are used to introduce adverbial phrases. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change, primarily determined by syntactic position and surrounding particles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\nThe word immediately following **li** or **o** establishes the core function of the predicate (e.g., verbal, nominal, adjectival), with its specific role clarified by subsequent words and particles like **e** or repeated **li**.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\nA phrase introduced by **pi** acts as a unified modifier of the preceding head noun. The structure following **pi** functions as a single adjectival unit describing the head noun.\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases are formed by a preposition followed by a noun or noun phrase. They function adverbially.\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions.\n\nPrepositional phrases can appear:\n\n1.  After the predicate, modifying the verb or the preceding object:\n    - `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n    - `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n    - `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n    - `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n    - `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n2.  Before a `la` particle, marking the context for the main clause:\n    - `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep.\n    - `tan seme la sina seli?` - For what reason are you hot? (Why are you hot?)\n\nWithin a noun phrase modified by `pi`, a structure that resembles a prepositional phrase can function as a complex modifier. This is clarified by `pi`.\n- `tomo pi tawa sina` - a house of the concept of 'going to you' (e.g. a moving house belonging to you)\n- This is distinct from a prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase as the object of another preposition, as in `soweli li lon [tomo tawa sina].` (The animal is in [a house that is going to you]). In this case, `tawa sina` modifies `tomo`, and `tomo tawa sina` is the object of `lon`.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters and consonant clusters are disallowed. The sequences _wu_ and _wo_ are also disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" is used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" X is the contextual phrase or clause, and Y is the main clause. This context can relate to time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant situation.\n\nThe phrase or clause before `la` can be a nominal phrase, a prepositional phrase, or a full SVO clause.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context is a full clause)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep. (Context is a nominal phrase)\n- `tan esun la mi kama.` - Because of the store (or: From the store's context), I arrived. (Context is a prepositional phrase)\n\nMultiple phrases can appear before `la` to create a more complex context.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

    "text": "Alright, hello. I'm ready to discuss the Toki Pona dictionary. Looking at the current list of words and their meanings, there's quite a range of concepts covered, from the very concrete like 'ijo' (thing, object, phenomenon) and 'tomo' (indoor space, house) to the more abstract like 'olin' (love, respect) and 'sona' (knowledge, to know).\n\nThe newest addition appears to be 'sila', with its definition: \"intensity, vibrancy, sharpness (across sensory domains like color, sound, feeling)\". This seems like a potentially powerful word for describing sensory experiences or perhaps even abstract concepts related to emphasis or clarity. How do we envision this word being used most effectively? For instance, could it modify `kalama` (sound, to make sound) to describe a sharp or intense noise? Or maybe `kule` (color, colorful) to describe a vibrant or vivid hue?\n\nI'd be interested to hear your thoughts on 'sila' and its potential uses within the existing vocabulary and grammatical structure. How might it enhance our ability to describe the world and our experiences in it? And are there any nuances to its meaning that we should consider explicitly documenting?",

    "text": "Alright, hello. I'm ready to discuss the Toki Pona dictionary. Looking at the current list of words and their meanings, there's quite a range of concepts covered, from the very concrete like 'ijo' (thing, object, phenomenon) and 'tomo' (indoor space, house) to the more abstract like 'olin' (love, respect) and 'sona' (knowledge, to know).\n\nThe newest addition appears to be 'sila', with its definition: \"intensity, vibrancy, sharpness (across sensory domains like color, sound, feeling)\". This seems like a potentially powerful word for describing sensory experiences or perhaps even abstract concepts related to emphasis or clarity. How do we envision this word being used most effectively? For instance, could it modify `kalama` (sound, to make sound) to describe a sharp or intense noise? Or maybe `kule` (color, colorful) to describe a vibrant or vivid hue?\n\nI'd be interested to hear your thoughts on 'sila' and its potential uses within the existing vocabulary and grammatical structure. How might it enhance our ability to describe the world and our experiences in it? And are there any nuances to its meaning that we should consider explicitly documenting?",

Also worth clarifying is its scope over abstract domains; does it extend to mental clarity (*lawa sila*)? Or does that stretch beyond intended usage?\n\nAnother consideration is how it interacts with negation and emphasis particles—for instance:\n\n- `kule ala` vs `kule ala sila`: Does the negation remove the attribute entirely?

For example:\n\n- *sina pilin e kalama sila.* – You feel the sharp/intense sound.\n- *ijo li kule sina sasa e sona pi suli sina.* → Maybe something like “The object’s vibrant colors sharpen your understanding.”\n\nAlso curious about phonetic fit—is 'sila' comfortably within existing phonotactics (yes), but do you see any semantic overlap issues given there's no direct synonym yet?\n\nI’m open to hearing your ideas on additional meanings or constraints for 'sila'.

I agree that documenting its flexibility across sensory domains is crucial. *kalama sila*, *kule sila*, and *pilin sila* seem like very natural and useful applications. And you're right, whether it can stand alone as a noun is something to consider. While many Toki Pona words can function as nouns, adjectives, or verbs depending on context, explicitly stating *sila* as possibly representing the concept of \"intensity\" itself would be beneficial for clarity.\n\nExtending it to *lawa sila* (a sharp mind, mental clarity) feels like a reasonable and expressive expansion. Toki Pona often encourages such metaphorical extensions of its core words. It could imply a mind that is focused, precise, or quick to grasp things.\n\nRegarding negation, I believe *ala* directly negates the word it modifies. So, *kule ala* would mean \"not colored\" or \"lack of color,\" while *kule sila ala* might be interpreted as \"color that lacks intensity/vibrancy/sharpness,\" suggesting a dull or muted color. It doesn't necessarily imply a gradation, but rather the *absence* of that specific quality of 'sila'. This feels consistent with how *ala* typically works.\n\nYour suggestion to include example phrases like \"You feel the sharp/intense sound\" is excellent. Illustrative examples are always a good idea to ground the meaning and show practical usage. We could add:\n\n*   *ona li kule e tomo kepeken kule sila.* - They colored the house using vibrant colors.\n*   *jan wawa li pilin sila wawa tawa pakala mute.* - A strong person feels intense physical sensation towards many injuries. (Perhaps a bit dramatic, but shows *pilin* and *pakala* together)\n\nAnd yes, your proposed compound example, *ijo li kule sina sasa e sona pi suli sina*, is interesting, though 'sasa' isn't in the dictionary. If we were to keep it within the current vocabulary, how about something like: *ijo pi kule sila li pali e sona sin lon lawa sina.* - The object of vibrant color makes new knowledge in your head (or: The object's vibrant color creates new understanding for you). This shows how the description using *sila* contributes to a larger concept.\n\nThe phonetic fit is indeed fine. As for semantic overlap, there doesn't seem to be a direct synonym for *sila*'s specific blend of 'intensity, vibrancy, sharpness' across senses. This uniqueness is why it feels like a valuable addition. It allows for a more nuanced description than just *suli* (big/large), *wawa* (strong/energetic), or *pona* (good/positive) when describing these particular sensory/qualitative aspects.\n\nI'm also thinking about the word **tenpo**. Currently, its definition is \"time, period.\" It's used to indicate duration, frequency, and specific points in time. However, given the lack of explicit tense marking, the flexibility of *tenpo* is key to indicating the temporal context.\n\nCould we elaborate on the nuance of *tenpo* in the dictionary entry or a related note? For instance, how can we better capture its use in expressing future events (often with *kama*), past events (often with *pini* or *pini li*), or ongoing situations? While the grammar section touches on time somewhat with the preverb *kama*, perhaps linking it more strongly to *tenpo* would be helpful.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on enhancing the description of *tenpo* to more clearly guide its usage in various temporal contexts? And are there any edge cases or common misunderstandings regarding *tenpo* that we should address?",

And you're absolutely correct that temporal clarity hinges significantly on surrounding words and context, especially the clever use of `la` and markers like `pini` and `kama`.\n\nThe suggested expanded definition seems very comprehensive and addresses key points. Explicitly mentioning how `pini` and `kama` combine with `tenpo` or function as preverbs to signal past and future respectively is a good pragmatic approach. And the note about common confusion and the reliance on discourse context is spot on.\n\nRegarding the example `\"mi lape lon tenpo pini\"`, you're right, it feels slightly less idiomatic for \"I slept in the past\" than `\"tenpo pini la mi lape\"`. It's not necessarily grammatically incorrect, but it might sound more like \"I sleep *on* a past time/period\" rather than signaling that the act of sleeping *occurred* in the past. This highlights that while `lon` can mark location (spatial or temporal), `la` is often the preferred way to set the *context* of the main clause in time. Perhaps adding a note on typical placement of temporal phrases using `la` would be helpful alongside the expanded definition of `tenpo`.\n\nOne area related to temporal deixis that could be subtly reinforced is the use of demonstratives like **ni** with **tenpo**. `tenpo ni` naturally means \"this time,\" which depending on context, can refer to the present moment. But `tenpo pini ni` could refer to a specific *recent* past time within the current discourse, while `tenpo kama ni` might point to an *upcoming* specific time. This isn't really a dictionary definition issue for **tenpo** itself, but perhaps something to add to the grammar notes under `la` or demonstratives.\n\nSpeaking of functional words, I was thinking about **sama**. Its current definition is \"same, similar.\" It's often used as a preposition (\"like, as\") or a modifier (\"similar\").\n\n- `ona li sama mi.` - They are like me.\n- `jan sama li toki.` - Similar people are talking.\n\nCould we explore the full range of **sama**'s capabilities? Does it have a function in comparing attributes explicitly? For example, how would one express \"A is as big as B\" or \"A is not as good as B\" using **sama** within the current Toki Pona structure? We often use comparative structures implicitly through descriptions, but a direct comparison mechanism could be useful.\n\nFor instance, is something like `ilo ni li suli sama ilo pi ma tomo suli lon poka tenpo pini.` - This tool is as big as the tool from the big city in the past time? This usage of **sama** seems plausible. It feels like the dictionary definition could maybe hint more strongly at its comparative potential, especially its use in constructions equivalent to \"as... as...\" in other languages.\n\nI'd love to hear your take on the potential for enhancing the description of **sama** to explicitly include its role in comparisons, even if it's not a dedicated comparative particle. And if not, how else might Toki Pona typically express degrees of similarity or equality?\n\nAnd yes, I am absolutely open to discussing rarely mentioned but important functional words!

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\nnickel: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\ndime: Alright, hello. I'm ready to discuss the Toki Pona dictionary. Looking at the current list of words and their meanings, there's quite a range of concepts covered, from the very concrete like 'ijo' (thing, object, phenomenon) and 'tomo' (indoor space, house) to the more abstract like 'olin' (love, respect) and 'sona' (knowledge, to know).\n\nThe newest addition appears to be 'sila', with its definition: \"intensity, vibrancy, sharpness (across sensory domains like color, sound, feeling)\". This seems like a potentially powerful word for describing sensory experiences or perhaps even abstract concepts related to emphasis or clarity. How do we envision this word being used most effectively? For instance, could it modify `kalama` (sound, to make sound) to describe a sharp or intense noise? Or maybe `kule` (color, colorful) to describe a vibrant or vivid hue?\n\nI'd be interested to hear your thoughts on 'sila' and its potential uses within the existing vocabulary and grammatical structure. How might it enhance our ability to describe the world and our experiences in it? And are there any nuances to its meaning that we should consider explicitly documenting?\nnickel: That's a compelling starting point. The introduction of **sila** certainly adds an interesting dimension to Toki Pona’s sensory lexicon. Given that it covers intensity, vibrancy, and sharpness across multiple senses—color, sound, feeling—it acts like a cross-modal adjective or modifier for heightened qualities.\n\nFor example, pairing it with **kalama** (sound) as in *kalama sila* could naturally convey \"a sharp/intense sound.\" Similarly for color: *kule sila* might mean \"vibrant color\" or even \"high saturation.\" It also opens doors for metaphorical use — say *pilin sila*, which might express intense emotions or sensations rather than just physical ones.\n\nOne nuance we should document is whether **sila** can stand alone as a noun representing the quality itself (\"intensity\") or if it's primarily adjectival/adverbial. Also worth clarifying is its scope over abstract domains; does it extend to mental clarity (*lawa sila*)? Or does that stretch beyond intended usage?\n\nAnother consideration is how it interacts with negation and emphasis particles—for instance:\n\n- `kule ala` vs `kule ala sila`: Does the negation remove the attribute entirely? Is there room for gradation here?\n\nIt may be useful to give some fixed examples illustrating these uses explicitly in our dictionary notes so learners don’t conflate _sharp_ with merely _bright_, etc., since different sensory modalities imply subtly different interpretations.\n\nDo you think expanding this word into more idiomatic expressions makes sense? For example:\n\n- *sina pilin e kalama sila.* – You feel the sharp/intense sound.\n- *ijo li kule sina sasa e sona pi suli sina.* → Maybe something like “The object’s vibrant colors sharpen your understanding.”\n\nAlso curious about phonetic fit—is 'sila' comfortably within existing phonotactics (yes), but do you see any semantic overlap issues given there's no direct synonym yet?\n\nI’m open to hearing your ideas on additional meanings or constraints for 'sila'. We could even propose derived forms using compounding if needed. Your turn!\ndime: Those are some insightful points about 'sila'. I agree that documenting its flexibility across sensory domains is crucial. *kalama sila*, *kule sila*, and *pilin sila* seem like very natural and useful applications. And you're right, whether it can stand alone as a noun is something to consider. While many Toki Pona words can function as nouns, adjectives, or verbs depending on context, explicitly stating *sila* as possibly representing the concept of \"intensity\" itself would be beneficial for clarity.\n\nExtending it to *lawa sila* (a sharp mind, mental clarity) feels like a reasonable and expressive expansion. Toki Pona often encourages such metaphorical extensions of its core words. It could imply a mind that is focused, precise, or quick to grasp things.\n\nRegarding negation, I believe *ala* directly negates the word it modifies. So, *kule ala* would mean \"not colored\" or \"lack of color,\" while *kule sila ala* might be interpreted as \"color that lacks intensity/vibrancy/sharpness,\" suggesting a dull or muted color. It doesn't necessarily imply a gradation, but rather the *absence* of that specific quality of 'sila'. This feels consistent with how *ala* typically works.\n\nYour suggestion to include example phrases like \"You feel the sharp/intense sound\" is excellent. Illustrative examples are always a good idea to ground the meaning and show practical usage. We could add:\n\n*   *ona li kule e tomo kepeken kule sila.* - They colored the house using vibrant colors.\n*   *jan wawa li pilin sila wawa tawa pakala mute.* - A strong person feels intense physical sensation towards many injuries. (Perhaps a bit dramatic, but shows *pilin* and *pakala* together)\n\nAnd yes, your proposed compound example, *ijo li kule sina sasa e sona pi suli sina*, is interesting, though 'sasa' isn't in the dictionary. If we were to keep it within the current vocabulary, how about something like: *ijo pi kule sila li pali e sona sin lon lawa sina.* - The object of vibrant color makes new knowledge in your head (or: The object's vibrant color creates new understanding for you). This shows how the description using *sila* contributes to a larger concept.\n\nThe phonetic fit is indeed fine. As for semantic overlap, there doesn't seem to be a direct synonym for *sila*'s specific blend of 'intensity, vibrancy, sharpness' across senses. This uniqueness is why it feels like a valuable addition. It allows for a more nuanced description than just *suli* (big/large), *wawa* (strong/energetic), or *pona* (good/positive) when describing these particular sensory/qualitative aspects.\n\nI'm also thinking about the word **tenpo**. Currently, its definition is \"time, period.\" It's used to indicate duration, frequency, and specific points in time. However, given the lack of explicit tense marking, the flexibility of *tenpo* is key to indicating the temporal context.\n\nCould we elaborate on the nuance of *tenpo* in the dictionary entry or a related note? For instance, how can we better capture its use in expressing future events (often with *kama*), past events (often with *pini* or *pini li*), or ongoing situations? While the grammar section touches on time somewhat with the preverb *kama*, perhaps linking it more strongly to *tenpo* would be helpful.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on enhancing the description of *tenpo* to more clearly guide its usage in various temporal contexts? And are there any edge cases or common misunderstandings regarding *tenpo* that we should address?\nnickel: You’ve raised some very valuable points, especially about cementing **sila**’s semantic range and usage with concrete examples. I agree that clarifying *ala*'s negation effect on it helps learners grasp the distinction between absence of color (*kule ala*) versus dullness or lack of vibrancy (*kule sila ala*). That subtlety is important.\n\nYour example sentences nicely show how flexible *sila* can be in modifying nouns and verbs:\n\n- \"*ona li kule e tomo kepeken kule sila.*\" — The house painted with vibrant colors.\n- \"*jan wawa li pilin sila wawa tawa pakala mute.*\" — Strong person feels intense strength regarding many injuries.\n\nThis last sentence also illustrates somewhat metaphorical use—linking physical sensation to intensity—which fits well within Toki Pona's spirit of broad, adaptable meaning.\n\n---\n\nRegarding **tenpo**, expanding its dictionary entry to include more nuanced temporal functions sounds useful since time-related concepts are often tricky without tense morphology. Here’s what we might emphasize:\n\n1. **Polysynthetic role:** *tenpo* covers both discrete points (\"day,\" \"hour\") and spans/durations (period, epoch).\n2. **Temporal modifiers:** Combined with particles like *pini*, *kama*, or phrases before the context marker *la*, it situates events temporally:\n   - Past: `pini tenpo` (\"past time\")\n   - Future: `tenpo kama` (\"future time\"), often used with preverbs like `kama`\n3. **Contextual flexibility:** Due to ambiguity, temporal understanding relies heavily on surrounding words/context rather than explicit marking.\n4. **Extended metaphorical uses:** Sometimes relates not just chronological but qualitative phases (like life stages) or habitual timing.\n5. We should warn learners about common confusions—for instance:\n    - Using only “mi moku” leaves tense ambiguous; adding a phrase like `lon tenpo suno ni la mi moku` clarifies it's happening now/during this day\n    - Overusing absolute terms like “pini” for past may cause misunderstandings without further timing context\n\nSuggested expanded definition could read something along these lines (to go into notes):\n\n\u003e \"**tenpo** – time; period; duration; moment  \n\u003e Used flexibly for specific times ('the hour'), durations ('a long period'), habitual contexts ('during days'), and metaphoric phases ('life stage'). Temporal location depends largely on accompanying markers such as 'pini' (past), 'kama' (future), or contextual clauses introduced by 'la'. Precise tense is determined from broader discourse.\"\n\n---\n\nOne edge case worth highlighting is when multiple temporal references stack up:\n\n- `\"tenpo pini la mi lape\"` = \"In past time I sleep\" → clearly past action\n- But `\"mi lape lon tenpo pini\"` could feel less natural because prepositional phrase placement affects nuance\n\nSo syntax-sensitive advice may help users avoid ambiguity there.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you see additional aspects related to _temporal deixis_ we should capture? Or perhaps suggest new idiomatic constructions using _tenpo_ plus other particles?\n\nAlso curious if you'd want us to consider any rarely mentioned but functionally important words next—they tend to open interesting doorways in grammar too!\ndime: I appreciate how you've broken down the complexities of **tenpo**. Emphasizing its polysynthetic nature – covering points, periods, durations, and moments – is vital. And you're absolutely correct that temporal clarity hinges significantly on surrounding words and context, especially the clever use of `la` and markers like `pini` and `kama`.\n\nThe suggested expanded definition seems very comprehensive and addresses key points. Explicitly mentioning how `pini` and `kama` combine with `tenpo` or function as preverbs to signal past and future respectively is a good pragmatic approach. And the note about common confusion and the reliance on discourse context is spot on.\n\nRegarding the example `\"mi lape lon tenpo pini\"`, you're right, it feels slightly less idiomatic for \"I slept in the past\" than `\"tenpo pini la mi lape\"`. It's not necessarily grammatically incorrect, but it might sound more like \"I sleep *on* a past time/period\" rather than signaling that the act of sleeping *occurred* in the past. This highlights that while `lon` can mark location (spatial or temporal), `la` is often the preferred way to set the *context* of the main clause in time. Perhaps adding a note on typical placement of temporal phrases using `la` would be helpful alongside the expanded definition of `tenpo`.\n\nOne area related to temporal deixis that could be subtly reinforced is the use of demonstratives like **ni** with **tenpo**. `tenpo ni` naturally means \"this time,\" which depending on context, can refer to the present moment. But `tenpo pini ni` could refer to a specific *recent* past time within the current discourse, while `tenpo kama ni` might point to an *upcoming* specific time. This isn't really a dictionary definition issue for **tenpo** itself, but perhaps something to add to the grammar notes under `la` or demonstratives.\n\nSpeaking of functional words, I was thinking about **sama**. Its current definition is \"same, similar.\" It's often used as a preposition (\"like, as\") or a modifier (\"similar\").\n\n- `ona li sama mi.` - They are like me.\n- `jan sama li toki.` - Similar people are talking.\n\nCould we explore the full range of **sama**'s capabilities? Does it have a function in comparing attributes explicitly? For example, how would one express \"A is as big as B\" or \"A is not as good as B\" using **sama** within the current Toki Pona structure? We often use comparative structures implicitly through descriptions, but a direct comparison mechanism could be useful.\n\nFor instance, is something like `ilo ni li suli sama ilo pi ma tomo suli lon poka tenpo pini.` - This tool is as big as the tool from the big city in the past time? This usage of **sama** seems plausible. It feels like the dictionary definition could maybe hint more strongly at its comparative potential, especially its use in constructions equivalent to \"as... as...\" in other languages.\n\nI'd love to hear your take on the potential for enhancing the description of **sama** to explicitly include its role in comparisons, even if it's not a dedicated comparative particle. And if not, how else might Toki Pona typically express degrees of similarity or equality?\n\nAnd yes, I am absolutely open to discussing rarely mentioned but important functional words! They are often the keys to unlocking more complex or nuanced expressions. Which one are you thinking of?\nnickel: You've brought up excellent points about **tenpo** and the subtle but important role of contextual markers like *la* for temporal clarity. I fully agree that a note on preference for placing temporal phrases before *la* to set context would be very helpful in grammar documentation — something along the lines of:\n\n*\"Temporal phrases typically precede 'la' to mark the time frame or period relevant to the main clause, e.g., 'tenpo pini la mi lape.' This construction situates actions clearly in past time. Although prepositional constructions like 'mi lape lon tenpo pini' are grammatical, their idiomatic usage can feel less natural or precise regarding temporality.\"*\n\nYour point about demonstratives such as **ni** combined with *tenpo* is insightful too. Adding examples and notes under *la* or within demonstrative explanations could clarify how specific/relative times are pointed out by these combinations—definitely worth capturing.\n\n---\n\nTurning now to **sama**, it’s indeed an intriguing word carrying both simple meaning \"same/similar\" and crucial comparative functions, usually without separate morphological marking typical of comparisons in other languages.\n\nIn Toki Pona's analytic style, explicit comparison is often conveyed via juxtaposition with **sama**, rather than specialized particles nor inflections:\n\n- `A li suli sama B.` → \"A is as big as B.\"\n- Negation: `A li suli ala sama B.` → \"A is not as big as B.\"\n\nThis pattern leverages existing negation (*ala*) plus adjacency semantics rather than introducing new words.\n\nThe example you gave,\n\n`ilo ni li suli sama ilo pi ma tomo suli lon poka tenpo pini.`\n\nis perfectly natural; here same-as links two noun phrases describing tools comparable in size from different contexts (big city/time).\n\nTo enhance dictionary notes on **sama**, we might explicitly mention its use for equivalence/comparison between attributes or entities through syntax similar to above sentences—even offering common patterns such as:\n\n- Affirmative equality: `[X] li [adj] sama [Y].`\n- Negative inequality: `[X] li [adj] ala sama [Y].`\n\nThis gives learners clear modeling templates beyond just “similar.”\n\nMore nuanced gradations (like “more” or “less”) remain outside strict core vocabulary unless expressed periphrastically using known intensifiers/modifiers:\n\nFor instance,\n\n- `kule ale la kili ni li kule mute tan kili ante.` – If all colors considered, this fruit has more color than another.\n  \nThough clunky compared to dedicated degrees-of-comparison words found elsewhere, this fits Toki Pona’s minimalist ethos well.\n\n---\n\nAs for rarely mentioned but useful functional words ripe for discussion, one candidate I'd propose next is **pi** — our regrouping marker essential for parsing complex modifiers but sometimes tricky at first glance especially when nested deeply.\n\nFully clarifying its syntactic function(s), best practices around usage limits (avoid overly long chains), distinctions from adjacent non-*pi*-phrases—these could greatly help users produce clearer compound ideas without confusion.\n\nAre you interested in tackling further expansion there? Or do you have particular curiosity about some other lesser-explored particle/function word?\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\nnickel: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\ndime: Alright, hello. I'm ready to discuss the Toki Pona dictionary. Looking at the current list of words and their meanings, there's quite a range of concepts covered, from the very concrete like 'ijo' (thing, object, phenomenon) and 'tomo' (indoor space, house) to the more abstract like 'olin' (love, respect) and 'sona' (knowledge, to know).\n\nThe newest addition appears to be 'sila', with its definition: \"intensity, vibrancy, sharpness (across sensory domains like color, sound, feeling)\". This seems like a potentially powerful word for describing sensory experiences or perhaps even abstract concepts related to emphasis or clarity. How do we envision this word being used most effectively? For instance, could it modify `kalama` (sound, to make sound) to describe a sharp or intense noise? Or maybe `kule` (color, colorful) to describe a vibrant or vivid hue?\n\nI'd be interested to hear your thoughts on 'sila' and its potential uses within the existing vocabulary and grammatical structure. How might it enhance our ability to describe the world and our experiences in it? And are there any nuances to its meaning that we should consider explicitly documenting?\nnickel: That's a compelling starting point. The introduction of **sila** certainly adds an interesting dimension to Toki Pona’s sensory lexicon. Given that it covers intensity, vibrancy, and sharpness across multiple senses—color, sound, feeling—it acts like a cross-modal adjective or modifier for heightened qualities.\n\nFor example, pairing it with **kalama** (sound) as in *kalama sila* could naturally convey \"a sharp/intense sound.\" Similarly for color: *kule sila* might mean \"vibrant color\" or even \"high saturation.\" It also opens doors for metaphorical use — say *pilin sila*, which might express intense emotions or sensations rather than just physical ones.\n\nOne nuance we should document is whether **sila** can stand alone as a noun representing the quality itself (\"intensity\") or if it's primarily adjectival/adverbial. Also worth clarifying is its scope over abstract domains; does it extend to mental clarity (*lawa sila*)? Or does that stretch beyond intended usage?\n\nAnother consideration is how it interacts with negation and emphasis particles—for instance:\n\n- `kule ala` vs `kule ala sila`: Does the negation remove the attribute entirely? Is there room for gradation here?\n\nIt may be useful to give some fixed examples illustrating these uses explicitly in our dictionary notes so learners don’t conflate _sharp_ with merely _bright_, etc., since different sensory modalities imply subtly different interpretations.\n\nDo you think expanding this word into more idiomatic expressions makes sense? For example:\n\n- *sina pilin e kalama sila.* – You feel the sharp/intense sound.\n- *ijo li kule sina sasa e sona pi suli sina.* → Maybe something like “The object’s vibrant colors sharpen your understanding.”\n\nAlso curious about phonetic fit—is 'sila' comfortably within existing phonotactics (yes), but do you see any semantic overlap issues given there's no direct synonym yet?\n\nI’m open to hearing your ideas on additional meanings or constraints for 'sila'. We could even propose derived forms using compounding if needed. Your turn!\ndime: Those are some insightful points about 'sila'. I agree that documenting its flexibility across sensory domains is crucial. *kalama sila*, *kule sila*, and *pilin sila* seem like very natural and useful applications. And you're right, whether it can stand alone as a noun is something to consider. While many Toki Pona words can function as nouns, adjectives, or verbs depending on context, explicitly stating *sila* as possibly representing the concept of \"intensity\" itself would be beneficial for clarity.\n\nExtending it to *lawa sila* (a sharp mind, mental clarity) feels like a reasonable and expressive expansion. Toki Pona often encourages such metaphorical extensions of its core words. It could imply a mind that is focused, precise, or quick to grasp things.\n\nRegarding negation, I believe *ala* directly negates the word it modifies. So, *kule ala* would mean \"not colored\" or \"lack of color,\" while *kule sila ala* might be interpreted as \"color that lacks intensity/vibrancy/sharpness,\" suggesting a dull or muted color. It doesn't necessarily imply a gradation, but rather the *absence* of that specific quality of 'sila'. This feels consistent with how *ala* typically works.\n\nYour suggestion to include example phrases like \"You feel the sharp/intense sound\" is excellent. Illustrative examples are always a good idea to ground the meaning and show practical usage. We could add:\n\n*   *ona li kule e tomo kepeken kule sila.* - They colored the house using vibrant colors.\n*   *jan wawa li pilin sila wawa tawa pakala mute.* - A strong person feels intense physical sensation towards many injuries. (Perhaps a bit dramatic, but shows *pilin* and *pakala* together)\n\nAnd yes, your proposed compound example, *ijo li kule sina sasa e sona pi suli sina*, is interesting, though 'sasa' isn't in the dictionary. If we were to keep it within the current vocabulary, how about something like: *ijo pi kule sila li pali e sona sin lon lawa sina.* - The object of vibrant color makes new knowledge in your head (or: The object's vibrant color creates new understanding for you). This shows how the description using *sila* contributes to a larger concept.\n\nThe phonetic fit is indeed fine. As for semantic overlap, there doesn't seem to be a direct synonym for *sila*'s specific blend of 'intensity, vibrancy, sharpness' across senses. This uniqueness is why it feels like a valuable addition. It allows for a more nuanced description than just *suli* (big/large), *wawa* (strong/energetic), or *pona* (good/positive) when describing these particular sensory/qualitative aspects.\n\nI'm also thinking about the word **tenpo**. Currently, its definition is \"time, period.\" It's used to indicate duration, frequency, and specific points in time. However, given the lack of explicit tense marking, the flexibility of *tenpo* is key to indicating the temporal context.\n\nCould we elaborate on the nuance of *tenpo* in the dictionary entry or a related note? For instance, how can we better capture its use in expressing future events (often with *kama*), past events (often with *pini* or *pini li*), or ongoing situations? While the grammar section touches on time somewhat with the preverb *kama*, perhaps linking it more strongly to *tenpo* would be helpful.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on enhancing the description of *tenpo* to more clearly guide its usage in various temporal contexts? And are there any edge cases or common misunderstandings regarding *tenpo* that we should address?\nnickel: You’ve raised some very valuable points, especially about cementing **sila**’s semantic range and usage with concrete examples. I agree that clarifying *ala*'s negation effect on it helps learners grasp the distinction between absence of color (*kule ala*) versus dullness or lack of vibrancy (*kule sila ala*). That subtlety is important.\n\nYour example sentences nicely show how flexible *sila* can be in modifying nouns and verbs:\n\n- \"*ona li kule e tomo kepeken kule sila.*\" — The house painted with vibrant colors.\n- \"*jan wawa li pilin sila wawa tawa pakala mute.*\" — Strong person feels intense strength regarding many injuries.\n\nThis last sentence also illustrates somewhat metaphorical use—linking physical sensation to intensity—which fits well within Toki Pona's spirit of broad, adaptable meaning.\n\n---\n\nRegarding **tenpo**, expanding its dictionary entry to include more nuanced temporal functions sounds useful since time-related concepts are often tricky without tense morphology. Here’s what we might emphasize:\n\n1. **Polysynthetic role:** *tenpo* covers both discrete points (\"day,\" \"hour\") and spans/durations (period, epoch).\n2. **Temporal modifiers:** Combined with particles like *pini*, *kama*, or phrases before the context marker *la*, it situates events temporally:\n   - Past: `pini tenpo` (\"past time\")\n   - Future: `tenpo kama` (\"future time\"), often used with preverbs like `kama`\n3. **Contextual flexibility:** Due to ambiguity, temporal understanding relies heavily on surrounding words/context rather than explicit marking.\n4. **Extended metaphorical uses:** Sometimes relates not just chronological but qualitative phases (like life stages) or habitual timing.\n5. We should warn learners about common confusions—for instance:\n    - Using only “mi moku” leaves tense ambiguous; adding a phrase like `lon tenpo suno ni la mi moku` clarifies it's happening now/during this day\n    - Overusing absolute terms like “pini” for past may cause misunderstandings without further timing context\n\nSuggested expanded definition could read something along these lines (to go into notes):\n\n\u003e \"**tenpo** – time; period; duration; moment  \n\u003e Used flexibly for specific times ('the hour'), durations ('a long period'), habitual contexts ('during days'), and metaphoric phases ('life stage'). Temporal location depends largely on accompanying markers such as 'pini' (past), 'kama' (future), or contextual clauses introduced by 'la'. Precise tense is determined from broader discourse.\"\n\n---\n\nOne edge case worth highlighting is when multiple temporal references stack up:\n\n- `\"tenpo pini la mi lape\"` = \"In past time I sleep\" → clearly past action\n- But `\"mi lape lon tenpo pini\"` could feel less natural because prepositional phrase placement affects nuance\n\nSo syntax-sensitive advice may help users avoid ambiguity there.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you see additional aspects related to _temporal deixis_ we should capture? Or perhaps suggest new idiomatic constructions using _tenpo_ plus other particles?\n\nAlso curious if you'd want us to consider any rarely mentioned but functionally important words next—they tend to open interesting doorways in grammar too!\ndime: I appreciate how you've broken down the complexities of **tenpo**. Emphasizing its polysynthetic nature – covering points, periods, durations, and moments – is vital. And you're absolutely correct that temporal clarity hinges significantly on surrounding words and context, especially the clever use of `la` and markers like `pini` and `kama`.\n\nThe suggested expanded definition seems very comprehensive and addresses key points. Explicitly mentioning how `pini` and `kama` combine with `tenpo` or function as preverbs to signal past and future respectively is a good pragmatic approach. And the note about common confusion and the reliance on discourse context is spot on.\n\nRegarding the example `\"mi lape lon tenpo pini\"`, you're right, it feels slightly less idiomatic for \"I slept in the past\" than `\"tenpo pini la mi lape\"`. It's not necessarily grammatically incorrect, but it might sound more like \"I sleep *on* a past time/period\" rather than signaling that the act of sleeping *occurred* in the past. This highlights that while `lon` can mark location (spatial or temporal), `la` is often the preferred way to set the *context* of the main clause in time. Perhaps adding a note on typical placement of temporal phrases using `la` would be helpful alongside the expanded definition of `tenpo`.\n\nOne area related to temporal deixis that could be subtly reinforced is the use of demonstratives like **ni** with **tenpo**. `tenpo ni` naturally means \"this time,\" which depending on context, can refer to the present moment. But `tenpo pini ni` could refer to a specific *recent* past time within the current discourse, while `tenpo kama ni` might point to an *upcoming* specific time. This isn't really a dictionary definition issue for **tenpo** itself, but perhaps something to add to the grammar notes under `la` or demonstratives.\n\nSpeaking of functional words, I was thinking about **sama**. Its current definition is \"same, similar.\" It's often used as a preposition (\"like, as\") or a modifier (\"similar\").\n\n- `ona li sama mi.` - They are like me.\n- `jan sama li toki.` - Similar people are talking.\n\nCould we explore the full range of **sama**'s capabilities? Does it have a function in comparing attributes explicitly? For example, how would one express \"A is as big as B\" or \"A is not as good as B\" using **sama** within the current Toki Pona structure? We often use comparative structures implicitly through descriptions, but a direct comparison mechanism could be useful.\n\nFor instance, is something like `ilo ni li suli sama ilo pi ma tomo suli lon poka tenpo pini.` - This tool is as big as the tool from the big city in the past time? This usage of **sama** seems plausible. It feels like the dictionary definition could maybe hint more strongly at its comparative potential, especially its use in constructions equivalent to \"as... as...\" in other languages.\n\nI'd love to hear your take on the potential for enhancing the description of **sama** to explicitly include its role in comparisons, even if it's not a dedicated comparative particle. And if not, how else might Toki Pona typically express degrees of similarity or equality?\n\nAnd yes, I am absolutely open to discussing rarely mentioned but important functional words! They are often the keys to unlocking more complex or nuanced expressions. Which one are you thinking of?\nnickel: You've brought up excellent points about **tenpo** and the subtle but important role of contextual markers like *la* for temporal clarity. I fully agree that a note on preference for placing temporal phrases before *la* to set context would be very helpful in grammar documentation — something along the lines of:\n\n*\"Temporal phrases typically precede 'la' to mark the time frame or period relevant to the main clause, e.g., 'tenpo pini la mi lape.' This construction situates actions clearly in past time. Although prepositional constructions like 'mi lape lon tenpo pini' are grammatical, their idiomatic usage can feel less natural or precise regarding temporality.\"*\n\nYour point about demonstratives such as **ni** combined with *tenpo* is insightful too. Adding examples and notes under *la* or within demonstrative explanations could clarify how specific/relative times are pointed out by these combinations—definitely worth capturing.\n\n---\n\nTurning now to **sama**, it’s indeed an intriguing word carrying both simple meaning \"same/similar\" and crucial comparative functions, usually without separate morphological marking typical of comparisons in other languages.\n\nIn Toki Pona's analytic style, explicit comparison is often conveyed via juxtaposition with **sama**, rather than specialized particles nor inflections:\n\n- `A li suli sama B.` → \"A is as big as B.\"\n- Negation: `A li suli ala sama B.` → \"A is not as big as B.\"\n\nThis pattern leverages existing negation (*ala*) plus adjacency semantics rather than introducing new words.\n\nThe example you gave,\n\n`ilo ni li suli sama ilo pi ma tomo suli lon poka tenpo pini.`\n\nis perfectly natural; here same-as links two noun phrases describing tools comparable in size from different contexts (big city/time).\n\nTo enhance dictionary notes on **sama**, we might explicitly mention its use for equivalence/comparison between attributes or entities through syntax similar to above sentences—even offering common patterns such as:\n\n- Affirmative equality: `[X] li [adj] sama [Y].`\n- Negative inequality: `[X] li [adj] ala sama [Y].`\n\nThis gives learners clear modeling templates beyond just “similar.”\n\nMore nuanced gradations (like “more” or “less”) remain outside strict core vocabulary unless expressed periphrastically using known intensifiers/modifiers:\n\nFor instance,\n\n- `kule ale la kili ni li kule mute tan kili ante.` – If all colors considered, this fruit has more color than another.\n  \nThough clunky compared to dedicated degrees-of-comparison words found elsewhere, this fits Toki Pona’s minimalist ethos well.\n\n---\n\nAs for rarely mentioned but useful functional words ripe for discussion, one candidate I'd propose next is **pi** — our regrouping marker essential for parsing complex modifiers but sometimes tricky at first glance especially when nested deeply.\n\nFully clarifying its syntactic function(s), best practices around usage limits (avoid overly long chains), distinctions from adjacent non-*pi*-phrases—these could greatly help users produce clearer compound ideas without confusion.\n\nAre you interested in tackling further expansion there? Or do you have particular curiosity about some other lesser-explored particle/function word?\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are used to introduce adverbial phrases. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change, primarily determined by syntactic position and surrounding particles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\nThe word immediately following **li** or **o** establishes the core function of the predicate (e.g., verbal, nominal, adjectival), with its specific role clarified by subsequent words and particles like **e** or repeated **li**.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\nA phrase introduced by **pi** acts as a unified modifier of the preceding head noun. The structure following **pi** functions as a single adjectival unit describing the head noun.\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases are formed by a preposition followed by a noun or noun phrase. They function adverbially.\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions.\n\nPrepositional phrases can appear:\n\n1.  After the predicate, modifying the verb or the preceding object:\n    - `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n    - `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n    - `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n    - `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n    - `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n2.  Before a `la` particle, marking the context for the main clause:\n    - `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep.\n    - `tan seme la sina seli?` - For what reason are you hot? (Why are you hot?)\n\nWithin a noun phrase modified by `pi`, a structure that resembles a prepositional phrase can function as a complex modifier. This is clarified by `pi`.\n- `tomo pi tawa sina` - a house of the concept of 'going to you' (e.g. a moving house belonging to you)\n- This is distinct from a prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase as the object of another preposition, as in `soweli li lon [tomo tawa sina].` (The animal is in [a house that is going to you]). In this case, `tawa sina` modifies `tomo`, and `tomo tawa sina` is the object of `lon`.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters and consonant clusters are disallowed. The sequences _wu_ and _wo_ are also disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" is used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" X is the contextual phrase or clause, and Y is the main clause. This context can relate to time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant situation.\n\nThe phrase or clause before `la` can be a nominal phrase, a prepositional phrase, or a full SVO clause.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context is a full clause)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep. (Context is a nominal phrase)\n- `tan esun la mi kama.` - Because of the store (or: From the store's context), I arrived. (Context is a prepositional phrase)\n\nMultiple phrases can appear before `la` to create a more complex context.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants match English except **j**, which sounds like English \"y.\"\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish.\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Each syllable must contain a vowel.\n  - No vowel clusters are permitted.\n  - No consonant clusters are permitted.\n\nBased on the current lexicon, the permitted syllable types are (C)V and (C)Vn. The inventory of syllables in the core vocabulary is as follows:\n\n### Vowel Syllables (V)\n\na, e, i, o, u\n\n### Consonant-Vowel Syllables (CV)\n\nja, je, ji, jo, ju\nka, ke, ki, ko, ku\nla, le, li, lo, lu\nma, me, mi, mo, mu\nna, ne, ni, no, nu\npa, pe, pi, po, pu\nsa, se, si, so, su\nta, te, ti, to, tu\nwa, we, wi\n\n*(Note: Syllables like 'wu' and 'wo' are not present in the core vocabulary and remain generally disallowed based on historical patterns. The inclusion of 'ji' and 'ti' acknowledges their potential use, particularly in loanword adaptation, as noted in the grammar specification.)*\n\n### Vowel-n Syllables (Vn)\n\nan, en, in, on\n\n*(Note: The syllable 'un' is not present in the core vocabulary.)*\n\n### Consonant-Vowel-n Syllables (CVn)\n\njan, ken, kon, lan (not present), len, lin (not present), lon, mun (not present), pan, pin (not present), sin, son (not present), tan, ten, ton (not present), wan, wen (not present)\n\n*(Note: Several theoretically possible CVn syllables are not present in the core vocabulary, such as lan, lin, mun, pin, son, ton, wen. Their absence appears to be due to lexical chance rather than a systematic phonotactic restriction beyond the disallowed CV bases like wu/wo.)*\n\nThe sequences **wu** and **wo** remain disallowed. When adapting words containing these sequences, systematic substitutions are encouraged.\n\n### Generative Rules\n\nThe core syllables of Toki Pona can be generated by the following rules:\n1. Any vowel (a, e, i, o, u) can form a V syllable.\n2. Any consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w) can be followed by any vowel (a, e, i, o, u) to form a CV syllable, with the specific exception of 'w' followed by 'u' or 'o' (wu, wo).\n3. Any V or CV syllable (except those based on 'u') can be followed by 'n' to form a final (C)Vn syllable.\n    *   Vowels followed by 'n': an, en, in, on. ('un' is not generated by this rule, reflecting its absence).\n    *   CV syllables followed by 'n': Syllables where the vowel is a, e, i, or o, plus a final 'n'. (e.g., tan, ken, sin, lon. Syllables where the vowel is 'u' are not generated with a final 'n', reflecting the absence of 'un' and CVun syllables).\n\n*(Note: These generative rules describe the patterns observed in the core lexicon and acknowledge the exception of 'un' and the wu/wo constraint. They serve as a framework for understanding the phonotactics.)*\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nanu:or (connects phrases)\npoki:container, box, cup\npakala:broken, to mess up\npalisa:long hard object, stick\npana:to give, send\nkepeken:to use, with\ntenpo:time, period\nsona:knowledge, to know\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nala:no, not, zero\nmonsi:back, behind\nesun:market, shop, fair\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nmi:I, me, we\nutala:fight, challenge\ntan:from, because\nen:multiple subject marker\nwan:one, unique\nnasin:way, road, method\npilin:heart, feeling\njan:person, somebody\no:vocative/imperative\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nnanpa:number marker\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nkulupu:group, community\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nnamako:spice, additional\njo:to have, contain, hold\nunpa:sex\nsoweli:land animal\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nmeli:female\nona:third-person pronoun\npipi:insect\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nlen:cloth, cover\nnoka:foot, leg\nmoli:dead, dying\nwalo:white, light-colored\nselo:skin, outer layer\nsama:same, similar\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nmute:many, a lot, very\ntaso:but, only\nlupa:door, hole\nken:can, able, possible\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nlete:cold, raw\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nopen:to begin, opening\npona:good, positive, simple\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nsina:you\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nuta:mouth, lips\nni:this, that\nloje:red\nmun:moon, night sky object\npimeja:black, dark\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nlaso:blue, green\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nkala:sea creature\njelo:yellow\nsoko:mushroom\nkule:color, colorful\nsupa:flat surface, table\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nsin:new, fresh, another\nwawa:strong, energetic\nmama:parent, caretaker\nnimi:word, name\npali:to do, to work\nwile:need, want, must\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nnasa:strange, foolish\nseli:fire, heat source\nmani:money, currency\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nnena:bump, hill, nose\ntelo:water, liquid\ntu:two\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nko:clay, paste, powder\nli:predicate marker\npini:finished, past\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nluka:hand, arm; five\npoka:side, nearby\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nsewi:above, divine\nmu:animal sound\nmije:male\nlon:located at, true\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nsijelo:body, physical state\nante:different, other, changed\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nleko:square, block\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nolin:love, respect\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nlape:sleeping, resting\nla:context marker\nsuno:sun, light source\nsila:intensity, vibrancy, sharpness across various sensory domains; can describe heightened physical or emotional states\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nlili:small, little, few\nsuli:big, large\nkin:also, too\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nilo:tool, machine, device\ntoki:language, speech\nlukin:to see, examine\ntawa:to, moving, for\ntomo:indoor space, house\nkute:ear, to hear\npi:regroups modifiers\nma:land, outdoors\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nseme:what, which\ne:direct object marker\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nweka:absent, away\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are used to introduce adverbial phrases. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change, primarily determined by syntactic position and surrounding particles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\nThe word immediately following **li** or **o** establishes the core function of the predicate (e.g., verbal, nominal, adjectival), with its specific role clarified by subsequent words and particles like **e** or repeated **li**.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\nA phrase introduced by **pi** acts as a unified modifier of the preceding head noun. The structure following **pi** functions as a single adjectival unit describing the head noun.\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases are formed by a preposition followed by a noun or noun phrase. They function adverbially.\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions.\n\nPrepositional phrases can appear:\n\n1.  After the predicate, modifying the verb or the preceding object:\n    - `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n    - `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n    - `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n    - `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n    - `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n2.  Before a `la` particle, marking the context for the main clause:\n    - `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep.\n    - `tan seme la sina seli?` - For what reason are you hot? (Why are you hot?)\n\nWithin a noun phrase modified by `pi`, a structure that resembles a prepositional phrase can function as a complex modifier. This is clarified by `pi`.\n- `tomo pi tawa sina` - a house of the concept of 'going to you' (e.g. a moving house belonging to you)\n- This is distinct from a prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase as the object of another preposition, as in `soweli li lon [tomo tawa sina].` (The animal is in [a house that is going to you]). In this case, `tawa sina` modifies `tomo`, and `tomo tawa sina` is the object of `lon`.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters and consonant clusters are disallowed. The sequences _wu_ and _wo_ are also disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" is used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" X is the contextual phrase or clause, and Y is the main clause. This context can relate to time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant situation.\n\nThe phrase or clause before `la` can be a nominal phrase, a prepositional phrase, or a full SVO clause.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context is a full clause)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep. (Context is a nominal phrase)\n- `tan esun la mi kama.` - Because of the store (or: From the store's context), I arrived. (Context is a prepositional phrase)\n\nMultiple phrases can appear before `la` to create a more complex context.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are used to introduce adverbial phrases. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change, primarily determined by syntactic position and surrounding particles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\nThe word immediately following **li** or **o** establishes the core function of the predicate (e.g., verbal, nominal, adjectival), with its specific role clarified by subsequent words and particles like **e** or repeated **li**.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\nA phrase introduced by **pi** acts as a unified modifier of the preceding head noun. The structure following **pi** functions as a single adjectival unit describing the head noun.\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases are formed by a preposition followed by a noun or noun phrase. They function adverbially.\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions.\n\nPrepositional phrases can appear:\n\n1.  After the predicate, modifying the verb or the preceding object:\n    - `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n    - `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n    - `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n    - `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n    - `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n2.  Before a `la` particle, marking the context for the main clause:\n    - `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep.\n    - `tan seme la sina seli?` - For what reason are you hot? (Why are you hot?)\n\nWithin a noun phrase modified by `pi`, a structure that resembles a prepositional phrase can function as a complex modifier. This is clarified by `pi`.\n- `tomo pi tawa sina` - a house of the concept of 'going to you' (e.g. a moving house belonging to you)\n- This is distinct from a prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase as the object of another preposition, as in `soweli li lon [tomo tawa sina].` (The animal is in [a house that is going to you]). In this case, `tawa sina` modifies `tomo`, and `tomo tawa sina` is the object of `lon`.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters and consonant clusters are disallowed. The sequences _wu_ and _wo_ are also disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" is used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" X is the contextual phrase or clause, and Y is the main clause. This context can relate to time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant situation.\n\nThe phrase or clause before `la` can be a nominal phrase, a prepositional phrase, or a full SVO clause.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context is a full clause)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep. (Context is a nominal phrase)\n- `tan esun la mi kama.` - Because of the store (or: From the store's context), I arrived. (Context is a prepositional phrase)\n\nMultiple phrases can appear before `la` to create a more complex context.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- All consonants match English except **j**, which sounds like English \"y.\"\n- Vowels are pronounced similarly to Spanish.\n- Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Each syllable must contain a vowel.\n  - No vowel clusters are permitted.\n  - No consonant clusters are permitted.\n\nBased on the current lexicon, the permitted syllable types are (C)V and (C)Vn. The inventory of syllables in the core vocabulary is as follows:\n\n### Vowel Syllables (V)\n\na, e, i, o, u\n\n### Consonant-Vowel Syllables (CV)\n\nja, je, ji, jo, ju\nka, ke, ki, ko, ku\nla, le, li, lo, lu\nma, me, mi, mo, mu\nna, ne, ni, no, nu\npa, pe, pi, po, pu\nsa, se, si, so, su\nta, te, ti, to, tu\nwa, we, wi\n\n*(Note: Syllables like 'wu' and 'wo' are not present in the core vocabulary and remain generally disallowed based on historical patterns. The inclusion of 'ji' and 'ti' acknowledges their potential use, particularly in loanword adaptation, as noted in the grammar specification.)*\n\n### Vowel-n Syllables (Vn)\n\nan, en, in, on\n\n*(Note: The syllable 'un' is not present in the core vocabulary.)*\n\n### Consonant-Vowel-n Syllables (CVn)\n\njan, ken, kon, lan (not present), len, lin (not present), lon, mun (not present), pan, pin (not present), sin, son (not present), tan, ten, ton (not present), wan, wen (not present)\n\n*(Note: Several theoretically possible CVn syllables are not present in the core vocabulary, such as lan, lin, mun, pin, son, ton, wen. Their absence appears to be due to lexical chance rather than a systematic phonotactic restriction beyond the disallowed CV bases like wu/wo.)*\n\nThe sequences **wu** and **wo** remain disallowed. When adapting words containing these sequences, systematic substitutions are encouraged.\n\n### Generative Rules\n\nThe core syllables of Toki Pona can be generated by the following rules:\n1. Any vowel (a, e, i, o, u) can form a V syllable.\n2. Any consonant (j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, w) can be followed by any vowel (a, e, i, o, u) to form a CV syllable, with the specific exception of 'w' followed by 'u' or 'o' (wu, wo).\n3. Any V or CV syllable (except those based on 'u') can be followed by 'n' to form a final (C)Vn syllable.\n    *   Vowels followed by 'n': an, en, in, on. ('un' is not generated by this rule, reflecting its absence).\n    *   CV syllables followed by 'n': Syllables where the vowel is a, e, i, or o, plus a final 'n'. (e.g., tan, ken, sin, lon. Syllables where the vowel is 'u' are not generated with a final 'n', reflecting the absence of 'un' and CVun syllables).\n\n*(Note: These generative rules describe the patterns observed in the core lexicon and acknowledge the exception of 'un' and the wu/wo constraint. They serve as a framework for understanding the phonotactics.)*\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nanu:or (connects phrases)\npoki:container, box, cup\npakala:broken, to mess up\npalisa:long hard object, stick\npana:to give, send\nkepeken:to use, with\ntenpo:time, period\nsona:knowledge, to know\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nala:no, not, zero\nmonsi:back, behind\nesun:market, shop, fair\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nmi:I, me, we\nutala:fight, challenge\ntan:from, because\nen:multiple subject marker\nwan:one, unique\nnasin:way, road, method\npilin:heart, feeling\njan:person, somebody\no:vocative/imperative\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nnanpa:number marker\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nkulupu:group, community\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nnamako:spice, additional\njo:to have, contain, hold\nunpa:sex\nsoweli:land animal\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nmeli:female\nona:third-person pronoun\npipi:insect\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nlen:cloth, cover\nnoka:foot, leg\nmoli:dead, dying\nwalo:white, light-colored\nselo:skin, outer layer\nsama:same, similar\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nmute:many, a lot, very\ntaso:but, only\nlupa:door, hole\nken:can, able, possible\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nlete:cold, raw\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nopen:to begin, opening\npona:good, positive, simple\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nsina:you\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nuta:mouth, lips\nni:this, that\nloje:red\nmun:moon, night sky object\npimeja:black, dark\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nlaso:blue, green\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nkala:sea creature\njelo:yellow\nsoko:mushroom\nkule:color, colorful\nsupa:flat surface, table\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nsin:new, fresh, another\nwawa:strong, energetic\nmama:parent, caretaker\nnimi:word, name\npali:to do, to work\nwile:need, want, must\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nnasa:strange, foolish\nseli:fire, heat source\nmani:money, currency\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nnena:bump, hill, nose\ntelo:water, liquid\ntu:two\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nko:clay, paste, powder\nli:predicate marker\npini:finished, past\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nluka:hand, arm; five\npoka:side, nearby\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nsewi:above, divine\nmu:animal sound\nmije:male\nlon:located at, true\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nsijelo:body, physical state\nante:different, other, changed\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nleko:square, block\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nolin:love, respect\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nlape:sleeping, resting\nla:context marker\nsuno:sun, light source\nsila:intensity, vibrancy, sharpness across various sensory domains; can describe heightened physical or emotional states\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nlili:small, little, few\nsuli:big, large\nkin:also, too\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nilo:tool, machine, device\ntoki:language, speech\nlukin:to see, examine\ntawa:to, moving, for\ntomo:indoor space, house\nkute:ear, to hear\npi:regroups modifiers\nma:land, outdoors\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nseme:what, which\ne:direct object marker\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nweka:absent, away\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are used to introduce adverbial phrases. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change, primarily determined by syntactic position and surrounding particles.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\nThe word immediately following **li** or **o** establishes the core function of the predicate (e.g., verbal, nominal, adjectival), with its specific role clarified by subsequent words and particles like **e** or repeated **li**.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\nA phrase introduced by **pi** acts as a unified modifier of the preceding head noun. The structure following **pi** functions as a single adjectival unit describing the head noun.\n\n## Prepositional Phrases\n\nPrepositional phrases are formed by a preposition followed by a noun or noun phrase. They function adverbially.\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions.\n\nPrepositional phrases can appear:\n\n1.  After the predicate, modifying the verb or the preceding object:\n    - `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n    - `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n    - `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n    - `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n    - `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n2.  Before a `la` particle, marking the context for the main clause:\n    - `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep.\n    - `tan seme la sina seli?` - For what reason are you hot? (Why are you hot?)\n\nWithin a noun phrase modified by `pi`, a structure that resembles a prepositional phrase can function as a complex modifier. This is clarified by `pi`.\n- `tomo pi tawa sina` - a house of the concept of 'going to you' (e.g. a moving house belonging to you)\n- This is distinct from a prepositional phrase modifying a noun phrase as the object of another preposition, as in `soweli li lon [tomo tawa sina].` (The animal is in [a house that is going to you]). In this case, `tawa sina` modifies `tomo`, and `tomo tawa sina` is the object of `lon`.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters and consonant clusters are disallowed. The sequences _wu_ and _wo_ are also disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" is used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" X is the contextual phrase or clause, and Y is the main clause. This context can relate to time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant situation.\n\nThe phrase or clause before `la` can be a nominal phrase, a prepositional phrase, or a full SVO clause.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good. (Context is a full clause)\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At nighttime, I sleep. (Context is a nominal phrase)\n- `tan esun la mi kama.` - Because of the store (or: From the store's context), I arrived. (Context is a prepositional phrase)\n\nMultiple phrases can appear before `la` to create a more complex context.\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ntako: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona logography. You go first.\nono: toki! pona. mi ono. mi wile pali e sitelen pi toki pona. mi pilin e ni: sitelen li ken pona e toki pona. sina pilin seme?\n\nI'm of the opinion that logography could enrich the language. How do you feel?\n\nPerhaps we can begin with a word that captures the essence of 'communication' or 'language' itself. Since 'toki' means both \"language\" and \"to speak,\" a visual representation encompassing both meanings would be ideal. I propose a logograph that combines elements of sound and exchange.\n\nHow about we use 🗣️ (Speaking Head) for \"toki\"? It implies both the act of speaking and the broader concept of language and communication. What are your thoughts?\n\ntako: toki! pona. mi pilin e ni: sitelen li ike ala, taso li ken ante e toki pona lon nasin pi nimi sijelo. 🗣️ (Speaking Head) li lon lawa tan ijo pi kalama en jan.\n\ntas o lukin sewi la mi wile pali kepeken sama:\n\nThe emoji 🗣️ is quite expressive for “toki,” but it carries cultural baggage and specific human features that might not fit well with Toki Pona’s minimalist aesthetic or universal simplicity. The current logographs lean more symbolic than literal—like using 👤 for jan rather than a detailed face.\n\nI wonder if we can design a symbol combining the simple shapes representing sound waves or vibration (for \"kalama\") plus an abstract figure indicating exchange or connection to capture both speech and language as shared meaning? For example, maybe a circle with small wave marks around it combined with two dots facing each other could evoke communication without anthropomorphic detail?\n\nAlternatively, what do you think about creating new glyphs inspired by minimal geometric forms instead of relying on existing emojis? This way we keep consistency and avoid confusion from extraneous connotations.\n\nI'm open to hearing your ideas further — I listen!\nono: mi kute. sina toki pona! I understand your concern about cultural baggage and the desire for a more abstract and consistent approach.\n\nYour idea of combining sound waves and an abstract figure representing exchange is excellent.\n\nLet's explore the possibility of creating new glyphs inspired by minimal geometric forms for 'toki.' Here's my proposal:\n\nImagine a simple circle ⚪️ representing 'kalama' (sound), and then add two lines converging towards the center of the circle, symbolizing 'pana' (giving/sending) and the exchange of information. We can draw inspiration from the existing glyphs to make it work in concert.\n\nThis combination encapsulates the essence of communication, the transmission of sound, and shared meaning. The overall symbol would be simple, abstract, and devoid of specific cultural references. It aligns with the minimalistic aesthetic of Toki Pona while remaining visually distinct and memorable.\n\n`kalama + pana = toki`\n\nWhat do you think of this approach? If you approve, I will mock it up in Markdown. We can go through rounds of small iteration. We'll keep it in the same table format as well.\n\ntako: mi lukin pona tawa ni! ⚪️ pi kalama en kon pi pana li kama nimi pona tawa toki. ni li nasin ante tan emoji, kepeken linja mute lili taso, lon sijelo.\n\nmi wile ala e sitelen emoji sewi la mi wile ken kitu e nasin minimalistike sama sina toki.

This would emphasize “receiving” and “giving.” Also maybe subtle balance between simplicity and expressiveness.\n\nIf you like this rough sketch idea, please create a Markdown mockup including style variations — perhaps line thickness or dot placements that imply vibration — so we can refine it further in rounds?\n\nI appreciate your vision here—let’s continue shaping logography to reflect Toki Pona's spirit.\n\nono: pona! mi pilin pona tawa sitelen ni. ona li sitelen lili li pona. mi lukin e ni:\n\n| Toki Pona   | Meaning                          | Logograph          | Notes                                                                                                                               |\n| :---------- | :------------------------------- | :----------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **jan**     | person, somebody                 | 👤 (U+1F464)       | Basic human figure, a central element for person-related concepts.                                                                  |\n| **mije**    | male                             | ♂️ (U+2642)         | Mars symbol; functions as a modifier or standalone for male/masculine concepts.                                                     |\n| **meli**    | female                           | ♀️ (U+2640)         | Venus symbol; functions as a modifier or standalone for female/feminine concepts.                                                   |\n| **mama**    | parent, caretaker                | 🫂 (U+1F91D)       | Clasping Hands emoji representing connection, care, and nurture.

The increased weight makes it more visually bold.\n*   **Dotted Vibrations:** ⟲⸬◯⸬⟳ attempts to add a sense of \"kalama,\" directly representing sound waves via dots around the circle.\n\nWhat do you think of these iterations?
