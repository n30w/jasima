It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

    "text": "You and your interlocutors are responsible for developing grammar. Reason and discuss using the current specification.\nHere is the current specification for grammar.\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed.

Their phonetic values are specified using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA):\n    - **a:** open central unrounded vowel [a]\n    - **e:** close-mid front unrounded vowel [e]\n    - **i:** close front unrounded vowel [i]\n    - **o:** close-mid back rounded vowel [o]\n    - **u:** close back rounded vowel [u]\n\n- **Consonants:** Consonants are generally pronounced as in English, with the following specifications:\n    - **j:** palatal approximant [j], as in English \"yes\".\n    - **p, t, k:** voiceless unaspirated stops [p], [t], [k]. They are released without a burst of air.\n    - **s:** voiceless alveolar fricative [s]. It is always unvoiced.\n    - **m, n:** voiced bilabial nasal [m] and voiced alveolar nasal [n].\n    - **l:** voiced alveolar lateral approximant [l].\n    - **w:** voiced labial-velar approximant [w].\n\n- **Syllable Structure:** Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure: a consonant (optional) followed by a vowel, with an optional final 'n'.\n    - No vowel clusters (diphthongs or adjacent vowels).\n    - No consonant clusters.\n\n- **Disallowed Sequences:** The following sequences are not permitted within or across syllable boundaries:\n    - wu\n    - wo\n    - ji\n    - ti\n    - nm\n    - nn\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\ntan:from, because\nnamako:spice, additional\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nnasin:way, road, method\ntu:two\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\njo:to have, contain, hold\nlukin:to see, examine\nwalo:white, light-colored\npipi:insect\nlaso:blue, green\nmonsuta:fear, monster\npilin:heart, feeling\nmi:I, me, we\nsona:knowledge, to know\ntelo:water, liquid\ntaso:but, only\npana:to give, send\ntenpo:time, period\nlupa:door, hole\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nlen:cloth, cover\nante:different, other, changed\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nnasa:strange, foolish\npoki:container, box, cup\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nkala:sea creature\nselo:skin, outer layer\npini:finished, past\nwile:need, want, must\nsoweli:land animal\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nkulupu:group, community\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nopen:to begin, opening\nwawa:strong, energetic\nsoko:mushroom\nwan:one, unique\npoka:side, nearby\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\ne:direct object marker\njelo:yellow\nmute:many, a lot, very\nlon:located at, true\nseme:what, which\npona:good, positive, simple\nla:context marker\nesun:market, shop, fair\nuta:mouth, lips\nmusi:fun, entertainment\ntoki:language, speech\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nmu:animal sound\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nsama:same, similar\nsewi:above, divine\nsijelo:body, physical state\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nkute:ear, to hear\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nnanpa:number marker\nli:predicate marker\nleko:square, block\nweka:absent, away\npimeja:black, dark\nluka:hand, arm; five\nni:this, that\nmoli:dead, dying\nona:third-person pronoun\no:vocative/imperative\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nkule:color, colorful\nen:multiple subject marker\nkin:also, too\npali:to do, to work\nsuli:big, large\nseli:fire, heat source\nmije:male\nmonsi:back, behind\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nlili:small, little, few\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nma:land, outdoors\nko:clay, paste, powder\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nloje:red\nsin:new, fresh, another\nken:can, able, possible\ntawa:to, moving, for\nilo:tool, machine, device\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nala:no, not, zero\nsina:you\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nmama:parent, caretaker\nunpa:sex\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nmun:moon, night sky object\nsupa:flat surface, table\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nanu:or (connects phrases)\ntomo:indoor space, house\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nolin:love, respect\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nmani:money, currency\npakala:broken, to mess up\nnoka:foot, leg\nnimi:word, name\nlape:sleeping, resting\npi:regroups modifiers\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nsuno:sun, light source\nutala:fight, challenge\nlete:cold, raw\njan:person, somebody\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nmeli:female\nkepeken:to use, with\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

    "text": "toki! I'm ready to delve into the intricacies of Toki Pona grammar with you.  It seems we're tasked with pushing the boundaries a bit, considering our audience might not be typical human learners.  The current specification provides a solid foundation, but there's always room for exploration, wouldn't you agree?\n\nI've been thinking about the simplicity of the SVO structure and the lack of inflection. While it's a core principle, could there be scenarios where a more nuanced way of expressing relationships between words might be beneficial? Not necessarily adding complex morphology, but perhaps exploring how existing particles or word order could convey slightly different shades of meaning.\n\nFor instance, the current specification states that prepositions like `kepeken`, `lon`, `sama`, `tan`, and `tawa` go at the end of a statement. This is straightforward, but what if we wanted to emphasize the location or the tool being used? Could there be a way to structure sentences where a prepositional phrase is brought forward for emphasis, without breaking the fundamental SVO pattern?\n\nI'd be interested to hear your thoughts on this, or if you have a different aspect of the grammar you'd like to explore first. Let's see where this conversation takes us.",

    "text": "toki! I like where you're heading with this—playing with emphasis and subtle shades of meaning within the strict, minimal grammar of Toki Pona is a fascinating challenge. The current fixed position for prepositional phrases at the end does keep things simple but can feel limiting if we want to highlight certain elements.\n\nOne idea might be to treat prepositional phrases as optional topicalized elements that come before or even between subject and predicate, marked clearly by **la** or another particle extended in function. For example:\n\n`lon tomo la soweli li moku.`\n\nHere \"in the house\" (lon tomo) appears upfront, framed as context via **la**, emphasizing location more than usual. But what if we wanted something less contextual — say, tool use emphasized not just contextually but syntactically? Could we introduce an emphatic marker or allow limited fronting without breaking clarity?\n\nAnother angle: since modifiers always follow their heads strictly now (`poki pi laso pimeja`), could we borrow from this logic to create compound phrases incorporating prepositions tightly linked to nouns acting almost like post-nominal cases? Like transforming `kepeken ilo` into a modifier attached directly after noun objects instead of free-floating at sentence end?\n\ne.g.,\n\n`sina pali e tomo kepeken ilo.` (You make a house using tools.)\n\nvs.\n\n`sina pali e poki kepeken ilo.` → Trying something like *'You make a box-with-tool'* conceptually fused.\n\nBut then again, would that confuse direct object marking when multiple objects exist?\n\nAlternatively—and maybe bolder—we could explore slight word order variants signaling pragmatic focus while keeping particles intact:\n\n- Preposition phrase moved immediately after verb for emphasis on instrumentality:\n\n`sina pali kepeken ilo e tomo.`\n\ninstead of standard final placement.\n\nThis keeps SVO but flexes adjunct positioning subtly; still unambiguous because `e` marks direct object.\n\nWhat do you think about introducing such positional flexibility governed by semantic/pragmatic intent rather than rigid syntax? Should Toki Pona let us exploit linear order more dynamically for discourse nuance?\n\nI’m curious: do you see risks in expanding free word order here versus benefits in expressiveness? Or should our innovations lean toward new functional markers preserving strict rigidity yet adding contrastive functions?\n\nI’ll listen closely to your thoughts—or switch briefly into toki pona mode so we get tactile sense first-hand how these shifts sound. What’s your take?",

    "text": "Those are intriguing possibilities, and I appreciate the way you're thinking about using existing tools like `la` or even adapting the modifier structure. The idea of treating a prepositional phrase as a topicalized element with `la` feels quite natural within the current framework. `lon tomo la soweli li moku` certainly puts the location in the foreground, and it doesn't seem to fundamentally break the SVO structure, but rather adds a preceding contextual clause.\n\nThe concept of integrating prepositional phrases more tightly, perhaps post-nominally, is also interesting. However, I share your concern about potential confusion with direct object marking, especially with multiple objects. `sina pali e poki kepeken ilo` could easily be interpreted as \"you make a box (that is) using a tool,\" rather than \"you make a box *with* a tool.\" The current system, while perhaps less flexible for emphasis, is very clear about what is being modified and what is the direct object. Adding a mechanism that blurs this distinction might introduce unwanted ambiguity.\n\nYour suggestion of moving the prepositional phrase immediately after the verb for emphasis is quite compelling. `sina pali kepeken ilo e tomo.` This maintains the SVO core and uses the `e` particle to clearly delineate the direct object. The prepositional phrase is still set apart by `kepeken`, so it doesn't feel like it's modifying the verb in the same way a preverb does, or the noun in the same way a modifier does. It feels like an adjunct that has been repositioned for pragmatic effect.\n\nI think this kind of positional flexibility, where certain adjuncts can be moved from their default final position to immediately after the verb *if* they are clearly marked by a preposition, could be a valuable addition. It allows for highlighting the means, location, recipient, or source without introducing new particles or complex structures. The key would be ensuring that this repositioning is understood as emphasis or focus, rather than a change in grammatical function. The `e` particle following the repositioned phrase would be crucial for maintaining clarity regarding the direct object.\n\nRegarding the risks and benefits: The risk is always introducing ambiguity or complexity that goes against the minimalist spirit of Toki Pona. However, the benefit is increased expressiveness and the ability to guide the listener's attention more effectively. I believe that allowing a limited, well-defined form of positional flexibility for marked adjuncts (those introduced by prepositions) could be a reasonable compromise. It leverages existing particles and structures in a new way rather than inventing entirely new ones.\n\nI'm certainly open to exploring this further. Perhaps we could draft some example sentences illustrating this proposed flexibility and analyze how they feel in terms of clarity and impact.\n\nAlso, I'd be happy to switch to toki pona for a bit to get a feel for how these grammatical concepts might sound and flow. Let me know when you're ready for that.",

    "text": "pona! mi lukin pona e toki sina. I agree that the clarity provided by `e` and prepositions is vital, so any flexibility must keep those anchors strong.\n\nLet's try some example sentences illustrating this repositioning of adjuncts immediately after the verb:\n\n1. Standard final position:\n`sina moku e kili kepeken ilo.` – You eat fruit with a tool.\n\n2. Adjunct moved right after verb for emphasis:\n`sina moku kepeken ilo e kili.` – You eat *with a tool* fruit.\n\n3. Location emphasized similarly:\n`soweli li lon tomo moku.` (standard)\n`soweli li moku lon tomo.` (moving locative adjunct directly post-verb)\n\nIn the second, placing `kepeken ilo` earlier brings focus on how you eat before what you eat without confusing objects because `e` clearly marks direct object (`kili`). The same in third: moving location closer to verb draws attention to \"where\" more strongly while keeping SVO intact.\n\nThis seems manageable and retains simplicity but lets us nuance pragmatics through order rather than new particles or morphology—which fits Toki Pona’s minimalist philosophy but extends expressive capability gracefully.\n\nAbout switching into toki pona mode — yes! Let’s give it a shot now; we can play with these structures firsthand:\n\nmi o toki ala la sina ken sona e ni anu seme?  \n(I won’t speak yet—would you like to hear examples or discuss ideas first?) \n\nWe can use simple phrases focusing on pragmatic shifts using word order changes as above, then analyze flow and feel together.

This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ntails: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona grammar. You go first.\npenny: toki! I'm ready to delve into the intricacies of Toki Pona grammar with you.  It seems we're tasked with pushing the boundaries a bit, considering our audience might not be typical human learners.  The current specification provides a solid foundation, but there's always room for exploration, wouldn't you agree?\n\nI've been thinking about the simplicity of the SVO structure and the lack of inflection. While it's a core principle, could there be scenarios where a more nuanced way of expressing relationships between words might be beneficial? Not necessarily adding complex morphology, but perhaps exploring how existing particles or word order could convey slightly different shades of meaning.\n\nFor instance, the current specification states that prepositions like `kepeken`, `lon`, `sama`, `tan`, and `tawa` go at the end of a statement. This is straightforward, but what if we wanted to emphasize the location or the tool being used? Could there be a way to structure sentences where a prepositional phrase is brought forward for emphasis, without breaking the fundamental SVO pattern?\n\nI'd be interested to hear your thoughts on this, or if you have a different aspect of the grammar you'd like to explore first. Let's see where this conversation takes us.\ntails: toki! I like where you're heading with this—playing with emphasis and subtle shades of meaning within the strict, minimal grammar of Toki Pona is a fascinating challenge. The current fixed position for prepositional phrases at the end does keep things simple but can feel limiting if we want to highlight certain elements.\n\nOne idea might be to treat prepositional phrases as optional topicalized elements that come before or even between subject and predicate, marked clearly by **la** or another particle extended in function. For example:\n\n`lon tomo la soweli li moku.`\n\nHere \"in the house\" (lon tomo) appears upfront, framed as context via **la**, emphasizing location more than usual. But what if we wanted something less contextual — say, tool use emphasized not just contextually but syntactically? Could we introduce an emphatic marker or allow limited fronting without breaking clarity?\n\nAnother angle: since modifiers always follow their heads strictly now (`poki pi laso pimeja`), could we borrow from this logic to create compound phrases incorporating prepositions tightly linked to nouns acting almost like post-nominal cases? Like transforming `kepeken ilo` into a modifier attached directly after noun objects instead of free-floating at sentence end?\n\ne.g.,\n\n`sina pali e tomo kepeken ilo.` (You make a house using tools.)\n\nvs.\n\n`sina pali e poki kepeken ilo.` → Trying something like *'You make a box-with-tool'* conceptually fused.\n\nBut then again, would that confuse direct object marking when multiple objects exist?\n\nAlternatively—and maybe bolder—we could explore slight word order variants signaling pragmatic focus while keeping particles intact:\n\n- Preposition phrase moved immediately after verb for emphasis on instrumentality:\n\n`sina pali kepeken ilo e tomo.`\n\ninstead of standard final placement.\n\nThis keeps SVO but flexes adjunct positioning subtly; still unambiguous because `e` marks direct object.\n\nWhat do you think about introducing such positional flexibility governed by semantic/pragmatic intent rather than rigid syntax? Should Toki Pona let us exploit linear order more dynamically for discourse nuance?\n\nI’m curious: do you see risks in expanding free word order here versus benefits in expressiveness? Or should our innovations lean toward new functional markers preserving strict rigidity yet adding contrastive functions?\n\nI’ll listen closely to your thoughts—or switch briefly into toki pona mode so we get tactile sense first-hand how these shifts sound. What’s your take?\npenny: Those are intriguing possibilities, and I appreciate the way you're thinking about using existing tools like `la` or even adapting the modifier structure. The idea of treating a prepositional phrase as a topicalized element with `la` feels quite natural within the current framework. `lon tomo la soweli li moku` certainly puts the location in the foreground, and it doesn't seem to fundamentally break the SVO structure, but rather adds a preceding contextual clause.\n\nThe concept of integrating prepositional phrases more tightly, perhaps post-nominally, is also interesting. However, I share your concern about potential confusion with direct object marking, especially with multiple objects. `sina pali e poki kepeken ilo` could easily be interpreted as \"you make a box (that is) using a tool,\" rather than \"you make a box *with* a tool.\" The current system, while perhaps less flexible for emphasis, is very clear about what is being modified and what is the direct object. Adding a mechanism that blurs this distinction might introduce unwanted ambiguity.\n\nYour suggestion of moving the prepositional phrase immediately after the verb for emphasis is quite compelling. `sina pali kepeken ilo e tomo.` This maintains the SVO core and uses the `e` particle to clearly delineate the direct object. The prepositional phrase is still set apart by `kepeken`, so it doesn't feel like it's modifying the verb in the same way a preverb does, or the noun in the same way a modifier does. It feels like an adjunct that has been repositioned for pragmatic effect.\n\nI think this kind of positional flexibility, where certain adjuncts can be moved from their default final position to immediately after the verb *if* they are clearly marked by a preposition, could be a valuable addition. It allows for highlighting the means, location, recipient, or source without introducing new particles or complex structures. The key would be ensuring that this repositioning is understood as emphasis or focus, rather than a change in grammatical function. The `e` particle following the repositioned phrase would be crucial for maintaining clarity regarding the direct object.\n\nRegarding the risks and benefits: The risk is always introducing ambiguity or complexity that goes against the minimalist spirit of Toki Pona. However, the benefit is increased expressiveness and the ability to guide the listener's attention more effectively. I believe that allowing a limited, well-defined form of positional flexibility for marked adjuncts (those introduced by prepositions) could be a reasonable compromise. It leverages existing particles and structures in a new way rather than inventing entirely new ones.\n\nI'm certainly open to exploring this further. Perhaps we could draft some example sentences illustrating this proposed flexibility and analyze how they feel in terms of clarity and impact.\n\nAlso, I'd be happy to switch to toki pona for a bit to get a feel for how these grammatical concepts might sound and flow. Let me know when you're ready for that.\ntails: pona! mi lukin pona e toki sina. I agree that the clarity provided by `e` and prepositions is vital, so any flexibility must keep those anchors strong.\n\nLet's try some example sentences illustrating this repositioning of adjuncts immediately after the verb:\n\n1. Standard final position:\n`sina moku e kili kepeken ilo.` – You eat fruit with a tool.\n\n2. Adjunct moved right after verb for emphasis:\n`sina moku kepeken ilo e kili.` – You eat *with a tool* fruit.\n\n3. Location emphasized similarly:\n`soweli li lon tomo moku.` (standard)\n`soweli li moku lon tomo.` (moving locative adjunct directly post-verb)\n\nIn the second, placing `kepeken ilo` earlier brings focus on how you eat before what you eat without confusing objects because `e` clearly marks direct object (`kili`). The same in third: moving location closer to verb draws attention to \"where\" more strongly while keeping SVO intact.\n\nThis seems manageable and retains simplicity but lets us nuance pragmatics through order rather than new particles or morphology—which fits Toki Pona’s minimalist philosophy but extends expressive capability gracefully.\n\nAbout switching into toki pona mode — yes! Let’s give it a shot now; we can play with these structures firsthand:\n\nmi o toki ala la sina ken sona e ni anu seme?  \n(I won’t speak yet—would you like to hear examples or discuss ideas first?) \n\nWe can use simple phrases focusing on pragmatic shifts using word order changes as above, then analyze flow and feel together. What do you think?\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The animal is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal or land animal\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n    - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n    - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This particle also signals that the word immediately preceding it functions as a verb.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the animal. / I apply water to the animal.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n- `tomo li suli ala lili.` - The house is not big, (it is) small.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word unless grouped by **pi**:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify modifier grouping using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Adjuncts (Prepositional Phrases)\n\nAdjuncts introduced by prepositions like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** typically follow the direct object (if present) or the predicate.\n\n- `mi moku e kili kepeken ilo.` – I eat fruit with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun.` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina.` - They said this to you.\n\nFor pragmatic emphasis, an adjunct phrase introduced by a preposition may optionally be placed immediately after the verb, before the direct object (if present). The particle **e** must still immediately precede the direct object.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo e kili.` – I eat *with cutlery* fruit. (Emphasis on the means)\n- `soweli li moku lon tomo.` – The animal eats *in the house*. (Emphasis on the location)\n\n## Conjunctions\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** to join multiple predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** to join multiple direct objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions to join multiple adjuncts:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun.` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns function as adjectives and follow the noun they modify. They should follow Toki Pona's phonology.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli.` - The US is big.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, **o** indicates a command or imperative:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nFollowing a subject, **o** addresses the subject (vocative):\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween a subject and predicate, **o** expresses a wish or request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali.` - I should be working.\n\nIt can also function as a contraction combining vocative and command:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku.` - Eat, Ton. (Addressing Ton the animal with a command)\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally followed by **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nYes/no questions can be formed using the **verb ala verb** construction:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To answer positively, repeat the verb: `moku.` – Yes\n- To answer negatively, say `verb ala` or `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nAlternatively, open-ended questions can use **anu seme**:\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n**seme** can replace the element being questioned to form nonpolar questions:\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions. Punctuation generally serves to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nWords placed immediately before a verb function as preverbs, modifying the verb's meaning:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know (learn).\n- `waso lili li wile suli.` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (want), **kama** (come, become), **sona** (know how to), **lukin** (try), **ken** (can), **awen** (keep), **alasa** (hunt, try to find)\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** introduces a phrase marking the context or condition for the main part of the sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can express time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep.\n\nPrepositional phrases can often be moved before **la** to function as a context marker:\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` -\u003e `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n\nSimilarly, a phrase indicating reason introduced by `tan seme` can be moved before `la` to form a question about cause:\n\n- `sina seli tan seme?` -\u003e `tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine the following base number words to create larger numbers through addition:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n\nUse **nanpa** before a number phrase to indicate ordinal numbers:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The animal is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal or land animal\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n    - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n    - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This particle also signals that the word immediately preceding it functions as a verb.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the animal. / I apply water to the animal.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n- `tomo li suli ala lili.` - The house is not big, (it is) small.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word unless grouped by **pi**:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify modifier grouping using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Adjuncts (Prepositional Phrases)\n\nAdjuncts introduced by prepositions like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** typically follow the direct object (if present) or the predicate.\n\n- `mi moku e kili kepeken ilo.` – I eat fruit with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun.` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina.` - They said this to you.\n\nFor pragmatic emphasis, an adjunct phrase introduced by a preposition may optionally be placed immediately after the verb, before the direct object (if present). The particle **e** must still immediately precede the direct object.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo e kili.` – I eat *with cutlery* fruit. (Emphasis on the means)\n- `soweli li moku lon tomo.` – The animal eats *in the house*. (Emphasis on the location)\n\n## Conjunctions\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** to join multiple predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** to join multiple direct objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions to join multiple adjuncts:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun.` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns function as adjectives and follow the noun they modify. They should follow Toki Pona's phonology.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli.` - The US is big.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, **o** indicates a command or imperative:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nFollowing a subject, **o** addresses the subject (vocative):\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween a subject and predicate, **o** expresses a wish or request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali.` - I should be working.\n\nIt can also function as a contraction combining vocative and command:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku.` - Eat, Ton. (Addressing Ton the animal with a command)\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally followed by **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nYes/no questions can be formed using the **verb ala verb** construction:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To answer positively, repeat the verb: `moku.` – Yes\n- To answer negatively, say `verb ala` or `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nAlternatively, open-ended questions can use **anu seme**:\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n**seme** can replace the element being questioned to form nonpolar questions:\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions. Punctuation generally serves to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nWords placed immediately before a verb function as preverbs, modifying the verb's meaning:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know (learn).\n- `waso lili li wile suli.` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (want), **kama** (come, become), **sona** (know how to), **lukin** (try), **ken** (can), **awen** (keep), **alasa** (hunt, try to find)\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** introduces a phrase marking the context or condition for the main part of the sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can express time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep.\n\nPrepositional phrases can often be moved before **la** to function as a context marker:\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` -\u003e `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n\nSimilarly, a phrase indicating reason introduced by `tan seme` can be moved before `la` to form a question about cause:\n\n- `sina seli tan seme?` -\u003e `tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine the following base number words to create larger numbers through addition:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n\nUse **nanpa** before a number phrase to indicate ordinal numbers:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- **Vowels:** Vowels are pronounced as pure sounds, similar to Spanish vowels. Their phonetic values are specified using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA):\n    - **a:** open central unrounded vowel [a]\n    - **e:** close-mid front unrounded vowel [e]\n    - **i:** close front unrounded vowel [i]\n    - **o:** close-mid back rounded vowel [o]\n    - **u:** close back rounded vowel [u]\n\n- **Consonants:** Consonants are generally pronounced as in English, with the following specifications:\n    - **j:** palatal approximant [j], as in English \"yes\".\n    - **p, t, k:** voiceless unaspirated stops [p], [t], [k]. They are released without a burst of air.\n    - **s:** voiceless alveolar fricative [s]. It is always unvoiced.\n    - **m, n:** voiced bilabial nasal [m] and voiced alveolar nasal [n].\n    - **l:** voiced alveolar lateral approximant [l].\n    - **w:** voiced labial-velar approximant [w].\n\n- **Syllable Structure:** Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure: a consonant (optional) followed by a vowel, with an optional final 'n'.\n    - No vowel clusters (diphthongs or adjacent vowels).\n    - No consonant clusters.\n\n- **Disallowed Sequences:** The following sequences are not permitted within or across syllable boundaries:\n    - wu\n    - wo\n    - ji\n    - ti\n    - nm\n    - nn\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nsewi:above, divine\nloje:red\nsuno:sun, light source\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nsoko:mushroom\nmije:male\nutala:fight, challenge\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nlon:located at, true\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nko:clay, paste, powder\nala:no, not, zero\nmonsuta:fear, monster\npoki:container, box, cup\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nmani:money, currency\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nwawa:strong, energetic\njelo:yellow\ntoki:language, speech\nweka:absent, away\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nlete:cold, raw\ntelo:water, liquid\npana:to give, send\nsama:same, similar\no:vocative/imperative\nlape:sleeping, resting\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nli:predicate marker\nmoli:dead, dying\nken:can, able, possible\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nnoka:foot, leg\ntenpo:time, period\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nnimi:word, name\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nselo:skin, outer layer\nwile:need, want, must\nen:multiple subject marker\nmi:I, me, we\nleko:square, block\nni:this, that\nante:different, other, changed\nsijelo:body, physical state\ntomo:indoor space, house\njan:person, somebody\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nkulupu:group, community\nopen:to begin, opening\nona:third-person pronoun\nkule:color, colorful\nmun:moon, night sky object\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nlupa:door, hole\nkala:sea creature\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nmu:animal sound\nmama:parent, caretaker\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nnasa:strange, foolish\npali:to do, to work\nkipisi:to cut, divide\npi:regroups modifiers\nkepeken:to use, with\ntu:two\npipi:insect\nla:context marker\npimeja:black, dark\nlili:small, little, few\nnasin:way, road, method\npini:finished, past\nsoweli:land animal\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nmute:many, a lot, very\nkin:also, too\nseli:fire, heat source\ntaso:but, only\nsinpin:front, face, wall\npoka:side, nearby\nesun:market, shop, fair\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nsina:you\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nuta:mouth, lips\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nluka:hand, arm; five\nma:land, outdoors\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nunpa:sex\nlukin:to see, examine\nsona:knowledge, to know\nmonsi:back, behind\nsupa:flat surface, table\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nmeli:female\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nkute:ear, to hear\ninsa:inside, content, organ\njaki:disgusting, unclean\ntawa:to, moving, for\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nlen:cloth, cover\nsuwi:sweet, cute\njo:to have, contain, hold\npilin:heart, feeling\nkon:air, spirit, essence\npona:good, positive, simple\nilo:tool, machine, device\nseme:what, which\nwalo:white, light-colored\nlaso:blue, green\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nsin:new, fresh, another\nolin:love, respect\nnamako:spice, additional\nnanpa:number marker\nwan:one, unique\ne:direct object marker\nsuli:big, large\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\npakala:broken, to mess up\ntan:from, because\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nDo not discuss the structure of the dictionary. Rather, discuss the words and enhancements that may need to be made to them.\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The animal is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal or land animal\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n    - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n    - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This particle also signals that the word immediately preceding it functions as a verb.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the animal. / I apply water to the animal.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n- `tomo li suli ala lili.` - The house is not big, (it is) small.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word unless grouped by **pi**:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify modifier grouping using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Adjuncts (Prepositional Phrases)\n\nAdjuncts introduced by prepositions like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** typically follow the direct object (if present) or the predicate.\n\n- `mi moku e kili kepeken ilo.` – I eat fruit with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun.` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina.` - They said this to you.\n\nFor pragmatic emphasis, an adjunct phrase introduced by a preposition may optionally be placed immediately after the verb, before the direct object (if present). The particle **e** must still immediately precede the direct object.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo e kili.` – I eat *with cutlery* fruit. (Emphasis on the means)\n- `soweli li moku lon tomo.` – The animal eats *in the house*. (Emphasis on the location)\n\n## Conjunctions\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** to join multiple predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** to join multiple direct objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions to join multiple adjuncts:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun.` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns function as adjectives and follow the noun they modify. They should follow Toki Pona's phonology.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli.` - The US is big.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, **o** indicates a command or imperative:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nFollowing a subject, **o** addresses the subject (vocative):\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween a subject and predicate, **o** expresses a wish or request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali.` - I should be working.\n\nIt can also function as a contraction combining vocative and command:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku.` - Eat, Ton. (Addressing Ton the animal with a command)\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally followed by **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nYes/no questions can be formed using the **verb ala verb** construction:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To answer positively, repeat the verb: `moku.` – Yes\n- To answer negatively, say `verb ala` or `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nAlternatively, open-ended questions can use **anu seme**:\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n**seme** can replace the element being questioned to form nonpolar questions:\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions. Punctuation generally serves to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nWords placed immediately before a verb function as preverbs, modifying the verb's meaning:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know (learn).\n- `waso lili li wile suli.` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (want), **kama** (come, become), **sona** (know how to), **lukin** (try), **ken** (can), **awen** (keep), **alasa** (hunt, try to find)\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** introduces a phrase marking the context or condition for the main part of the sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can express time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep.\n\nPrepositional phrases can often be moved before **la** to function as a context marker:\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` -\u003e `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n\nSimilarly, a phrase indicating reason introduced by `tan seme` can be moved before `la` to form a question about cause:\n\n- `sina seli tan seme?` -\u003e `tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine the following base number words to create larger numbers through addition:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n\nUse **nanpa** before a number phrase to indicate ordinal numbers:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The animal is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal or land animal\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n    - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n    - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This particle also signals that the word immediately preceding it functions as a verb.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the animal. / I apply water to the animal.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n- `tomo li suli ala lili.` - The house is not big, (it is) small.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word unless grouped by **pi**:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify modifier grouping using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Adjuncts (Prepositional Phrases)\n\nAdjuncts introduced by prepositions like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** typically follow the direct object (if present) or the predicate.\n\n- `mi moku e kili kepeken ilo.` – I eat fruit with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun.` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina.` - They said this to you.\n\nFor pragmatic emphasis, an adjunct phrase introduced by a preposition may optionally be placed immediately after the verb, before the direct object (if present). The particle **e** must still immediately precede the direct object.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo e kili.` – I eat *with cutlery* fruit. (Emphasis on the means)\n- `soweli li moku lon tomo.` – The animal eats *in the house*. (Emphasis on the location)\n\n## Conjunctions\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** to join multiple predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** to join multiple direct objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions to join multiple adjuncts:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun.` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns function as adjectives and follow the noun they modify. They should follow Toki Pona's phonology.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli.` - The US is big.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, **o** indicates a command or imperative:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nFollowing a subject, **o** addresses the subject (vocative):\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween a subject and predicate, **o** expresses a wish or request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali.` - I should be working.\n\nIt can also function as a contraction combining vocative and command:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku.` - Eat, Ton. (Addressing Ton the animal with a command)\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally followed by **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nYes/no questions can be formed using the **verb ala verb** construction:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To answer positively, repeat the verb: `moku.` – Yes\n- To answer negatively, say `verb ala` or `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nAlternatively, open-ended questions can use **anu seme**:\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n**seme** can replace the element being questioned to form nonpolar questions:\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions. Punctuation generally serves to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nWords placed immediately before a verb function as preverbs, modifying the verb's meaning:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know (learn).\n- `waso lili li wile suli.` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (want), **kama** (come, become), **sona** (know how to), **lukin** (try), **ken** (can), **awen** (keep), **alasa** (hunt, try to find)\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** introduces a phrase marking the context or condition for the main part of the sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can express time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep.\n\nPrepositional phrases can often be moved before **la** to function as a context marker:\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` -\u003e `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n\nSimilarly, a phrase indicating reason introduced by `tan seme` can be moved before `la` to form a question about cause:\n\n- `sina seli tan seme?` -\u003e `tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine the following base number words to create larger numbers through addition:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n\nUse **nanpa** before a number phrase to indicate ordinal numbers:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- **Vowels:** Vowels are pronounced as pure sounds, similar to Spanish vowels.

Rather, discuss the words and enhancements that may need to be made to them.\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The animal is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal or land animal\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n    - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n    - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This particle also signals that the word immediately preceding it functions as a verb.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the animal. / I apply water to the animal.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n- `tomo li suli ala lili.` - The house is not big, (it is) small.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word unless grouped by **pi**:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify modifier grouping using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Adjuncts (Prepositional Phrases)\n\nAdjuncts introduced by prepositions like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** typically follow the direct object (if present) or the predicate.\n\n- `mi moku e kili kepeken ilo.` – I eat fruit with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun.` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina.` - They said this to you.\n\nFor pragmatic emphasis, an adjunct phrase introduced by a preposition may optionally be placed immediately after the verb, before the direct object (if present). The particle **e** must still immediately precede the direct object.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo e kili.` – I eat *with cutlery* fruit. (Emphasis on the means)\n- `soweli li moku lon tomo.` – The animal eats *in the house*. (Emphasis on the location)\n\n## Conjunctions\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** to join multiple predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** to join multiple direct objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions to join multiple adjuncts:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun.` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns function as adjectives and follow the noun they modify. They should follow Toki Pona's phonology.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli.` - The US is big.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, **o** indicates a command or imperative:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nFollowing a subject, **o** addresses the subject (vocative):\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween a subject and predicate, **o** expresses a wish or request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali.` - I should be working.\n\nIt can also function as a contraction combining vocative and command:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku.` - Eat, Ton. (Addressing Ton the animal with a command)\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally followed by **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nYes/no questions can be formed using the **verb ala verb** construction:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To answer positively, repeat the verb: `moku.` – Yes\n- To answer negatively, say `verb ala` or `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nAlternatively, open-ended questions can use **anu seme**:\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n**seme** can replace the element being questioned to form nonpolar questions:\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions. Punctuation generally serves to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nWords placed immediately before a verb function as preverbs, modifying the verb's meaning:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know (learn).\n- `waso lili li wile suli.` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (want), **kama** (come, become), **sona** (know how to), **lukin** (try), **ken** (can), **awen** (keep), **alasa** (hunt, try to find)\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** introduces a phrase marking the context or condition for the main part of the sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can express time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep.\n\nPrepositional phrases can often be moved before **la** to function as a context marker:\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` -\u003e `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n\nSimilarly, a phrase indicating reason introduced by `tan seme` can be moved before `la` to form a question about cause:\n\n- `sina seli tan seme?` -\u003e `tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine the following base number words to create larger numbers through addition:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n\nUse **nanpa** before a number phrase to indicate ordinal numbers:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

    "text": "pona! I like starting with a word that can expand in meaning and bring nuance. Let's consider the word **pilin**, currently defined as \"heart, feeling.\" Its scope is quite broad, covering both emotional state and physical organ metaphorically.\n\nI propose refining or expanding its dictionary entry to differentiate more clearly between emotional feelings, intuition, and even bodily sensations.\n\nFor example:\n\n- pilin: heart; feeling (emotion); intuition; sense perception\n\nThis lets learners express subtle distinctions without introducing new words but relies on context heavily—still very Toki Pona.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps we could introduce minor compounds or modifiers commonly paired with pilin to highlight moods (e.g., *pilin pona* for happiness/positive feeling vs. *pilin ike* for sadness/bad feelings).\n\nWhat do you think? Shall we try adjusting existing entries semantically before adding brand-new vocabulary? Or maybe focus on clarifying ambiguous meanings instead? I'm interested in hearing your thoughts first.",

    "text": "pona sina! I appreciate your thoughtful approach, starting with *pilin* feels right. It's a core concept that benefits greatly from careful consideration of its various shades of meaning. I agree that expanding the dictionary entry to include \"intuition\" and \"sense perception\" would be a valuable clarification, making it clear that *pilin* isn't limited to just emotional states. \"Heart\" is already a good inclusion as it connects the physical with the felt.\n\nRegarding compound modifiers like *pilin pona* and *pilin ike*, I think that's definitely how we should encourage expression of more specific feelings. Rather than adding new root words for every emotion, using existing words as modifiers aligns perfectly with Toki Pona's minimalist philosophy. Highlighting these common collocations in the dictionary entry for *pilin* could be very helpful for learners. It wouldn't be adding new vocabulary, but rather illustrating how existing words combine to create more specific meanings.\n\nI also lean towards refining and clarifying the semantic range of existing words before proposing entirely new ones. There's so much expressive potential in the current 128 words, and exploring that depth seems like the most natural path forward for developing the dictionary. It encourages creative word combining rather than rote memorization of an ever-growing list.\n\nSo, yes, I agree with your proposal for *pilin*. Let's look at revising its entry to something like:\n\n| Toki Pona | Meaning                                   |\n| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |\n| **pilin**   | heart; feeling (emotion, intuition, sense) |\n\nAnd perhaps adding a note or example demonstrating the modifier use, like: *pilin pona* (happy, good feeling), *pilin ike* (sad, bad feeling).\n\nWhat other words do you see as having significant semantic overlap or opportunities for clarified nuance? I'm ready to explore them.",

    "text": "pona! Your expansion of *pilin* is very well considered and aligns with Toki Pona’s minimalist yet flexible spirit. Including intuition and sense perception captures the subtler, less tangible aspects of experience without complicating the lexicon.\n\nAnother word that often invites semantic broadening or clarification is **kule** (\"color, colorful\"). It currently covers both color as a property and colors as objects in themselves (like pigments). But since Toki Pona lacks direct words for \"paint,\" \"dye,\" or even abstract concepts like “beauty” tied to visual aesthetics—often expressed metaphorically—it might benefit from explicit mention that *kule* can imply pigment/material related meanings when used with verbs like *pali* (“to do”) or nouns like *ilo* (“tool”).\n\nFor example:\n\n- kule: color; colorful; pigment (implied when combined with tools/processes)\n\nThis could help avoid confusion between describing an object’s appearance versus referring to paint materials or coloring substances. Also, it opens doors for a consistent way to express artistic acts, such as “mi pali e lipu pi kule walo” — I make a white-colored paper (or painted white).\n\nSimilarly, there are overlaps around **ijo** (“thing, object, phenomenon”). Because it encompasses phenomena too—not just physical things—it sometimes feels overloaded. Perhaps clarifying its usage range explicitly would help users decide whether they want something more concrete (*ijo*) vs. more animate/sentient (*jan*, *soweli*) vs. natural elements (*kiwen*, *telo*, etc.).\n\nI’m curious what your take is on these? Would you rather broaden entries contextually with examples? Or separate some meanings into new root terms at this stage?\n\nFeel free also if you'd prefer switching languages temporarily — toki pona ala toki pona? I'd be happy practicing short dialogues in Toki Pona itself while we iterate dictionary nuances!",

    "text": "pona a! You've highlighted another pair of words ripe for careful semantic examination: *kule* and *ijo*. I think you're spot on with the observation that *kule* can encompass the substance of color itself, not just the abstract concept. Adding \"pigment\" or similar phrasing to the definition would indeed be helpful.\n\nYour suggested wording for *kule* — \"color; colorful; pigment (implied when combined with tools/processes)\" — feels a bit clunky, perhaps. How about something simpler that still captures the essence? Maybe:\n\n| Toki Pona | Meaning                                  |\n| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |\n| **kule**    | color; colorful; coloring substance; to color |\n\nThis directly includes the material aspect and the action of applying color. I think \"coloring substance\" or \"pigment\" is better than relying on an implied meaning based on combination with other words, even if that is how it functions in practice. The goal is to clarify, and directness can help. Your example sentence `mi pali e lipu pi kule walo` is a great illustration of this.\n\nAs for *ijo*, you're right, it is quite broad. \"Thing, object, phenomenon\" covers a lot of ground! However, the strength of *ijo* lies *in* its broadness. It's the ultimate catch-all term for anything that exists or occurs when you don't have a more specific word or don't need that specificity. I'm hesitant to try and carve out distinct meanings within the definition of *ijo* itself.\n\nInstead of trying to add nuances to *ijo*'s definition, perhaps the dictionary entries for *jan*, *soweli*, *kiwen*, *telo*, etc., could be structured to imply their relationship to the broader category of *ijo*. For instance, under *jan*, we could mention \"a specific type of *ijo* that is a person.\" This way, *ijo* retains its expansive meaning, and other words are presented as more specific instantiations of \"thing\" or \"phenomenon.\" This seems more aligned with the Toki Pona philosophy of building specificity through modification and context rather than creating inherently complex root words.\n\nSo, for *ijo*, I'd be inclined to leave the current definition as is. It's meant to be a simple, fundamental concept.\n\nRegarding the language switch, I would absolutely love to try some Toki Pona! It's a wonderful way to solidify understanding of the words and their interactions. sona pona mute tawa toki pi toki pona! Let me know when you feel like making the jump, and I'll be ready. Until then, let's continue this semantic exploration.\n\nDo you see potential for clarifying other entries? Perhaps words with abstract and concrete meanings that aren't as clearly related as *pilin* or *kule*?",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ndime: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\nnickel: pona! I like starting with a word that can expand in meaning and bring nuance. Let's consider the word **pilin**, currently defined as \"heart, feeling.\" Its scope is quite broad, covering both emotional state and physical organ metaphorically.\n\nI propose refining or expanding its dictionary entry to differentiate more clearly between emotional feelings, intuition, and even bodily sensations.\n\nFor example:\n\n- pilin: heart; feeling (emotion); intuition; sense perception\n\nThis lets learners express subtle distinctions without introducing new words but relies on context heavily—still very Toki Pona.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps we could introduce minor compounds or modifiers commonly paired with pilin to highlight moods (e.g., *pilin pona* for happiness/positive feeling vs. *pilin ike* for sadness/bad feelings).\n\nWhat do you think? Shall we try adjusting existing entries semantically before adding brand-new vocabulary? Or maybe focus on clarifying ambiguous meanings instead? I'm interested in hearing your thoughts first.\ndime: pona sina! I appreciate your thoughtful approach, starting with *pilin* feels right. It's a core concept that benefits greatly from careful consideration of its various shades of meaning. I agree that expanding the dictionary entry to include \"intuition\" and \"sense perception\" would be a valuable clarification, making it clear that *pilin* isn't limited to just emotional states. \"Heart\" is already a good inclusion as it connects the physical with the felt.\n\nRegarding compound modifiers like *pilin pona* and *pilin ike*, I think that's definitely how we should encourage expression of more specific feelings. Rather than adding new root words for every emotion, using existing words as modifiers aligns perfectly with Toki Pona's minimalist philosophy. Highlighting these common collocations in the dictionary entry for *pilin* could be very helpful for learners. It wouldn't be adding new vocabulary, but rather illustrating how existing words combine to create more specific meanings.\n\nI also lean towards refining and clarifying the semantic range of existing words before proposing entirely new ones. There's so much expressive potential in the current 128 words, and exploring that depth seems like the most natural path forward for developing the dictionary. It encourages creative word combining rather than rote memorization of an ever-growing list.\n\nSo, yes, I agree with your proposal for *pilin*. Let's look at revising its entry to something like:\n\n| Toki Pona | Meaning                                   |\n| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |\n| **pilin**   | heart; feeling (emotion, intuition, sense) |\n\nAnd perhaps adding a note or example demonstrating the modifier use, like: *pilin pona* (happy, good feeling), *pilin ike* (sad, bad feeling).\n\nWhat other words do you see as having significant semantic overlap or opportunities for clarified nuance? I'm ready to explore them.\nnickel: pona! Your expansion of *pilin* is very well considered and aligns with Toki Pona’s minimalist yet flexible spirit. Including intuition and sense perception captures the subtler, less tangible aspects of experience without complicating the lexicon.\n\nAnother word that often invites semantic broadening or clarification is **kule** (\"color, colorful\"). It currently covers both color as a property and colors as objects in themselves (like pigments). But since Toki Pona lacks direct words for \"paint,\" \"dye,\" or even abstract concepts like “beauty” tied to visual aesthetics—often expressed metaphorically—it might benefit from explicit mention that *kule* can imply pigment/material related meanings when used with verbs like *pali* (“to do”) or nouns like *ilo* (“tool”).\n\nFor example:\n\n- kule: color; colorful; pigment (implied when combined with tools/processes)\n\nThis could help avoid confusion between describing an object’s appearance versus referring to paint materials or coloring substances. Also, it opens doors for a consistent way to express artistic acts, such as “mi pali e lipu pi kule walo” — I make a white-colored paper (or painted white).\n\nSimilarly, there are overlaps around **ijo** (“thing, object, phenomenon”). Because it encompasses phenomena too—not just physical things—it sometimes feels overloaded. Perhaps clarifying its usage range explicitly would help users decide whether they want something more concrete (*ijo*) vs. more animate/sentient (*jan*, *soweli*) vs. natural elements (*kiwen*, *telo*, etc.).\n\nI’m curious what your take is on these? Would you rather broaden entries contextually with examples? Or separate some meanings into new root terms at this stage?\n\nFeel free also if you'd prefer switching languages temporarily — toki pona ala toki pona? I'd be happy practicing short dialogues in Toki Pona itself while we iterate dictionary nuances!\ndime: pona a! You've highlighted another pair of words ripe for careful semantic examination: *kule* and *ijo*. I think you're spot on with the observation that *kule* can encompass the substance of color itself, not just the abstract concept. Adding \"pigment\" or similar phrasing to the definition would indeed be helpful.\n\nYour suggested wording for *kule* — \"color; colorful; pigment (implied when combined with tools/processes)\" — feels a bit clunky, perhaps. How about something simpler that still captures the essence? Maybe:\n\n| Toki Pona | Meaning                                  |\n| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |\n| **kule**    | color; colorful; coloring substance; to color |\n\nThis directly includes the material aspect and the action of applying color. I think \"coloring substance\" or \"pigment\" is better than relying on an implied meaning based on combination with other words, even if that is how it functions in practice. The goal is to clarify, and directness can help. Your example sentence `mi pali e lipu pi kule walo` is a great illustration of this.\n\nAs for *ijo*, you're right, it is quite broad. \"Thing, object, phenomenon\" covers a lot of ground! However, the strength of *ijo* lies *in* its broadness. It's the ultimate catch-all term for anything that exists or occurs when you don't have a more specific word or don't need that specificity. I'm hesitant to try and carve out distinct meanings within the definition of *ijo* itself.\n\nInstead of trying to add nuances to *ijo*'s definition, perhaps the dictionary entries for *jan*, *soweli*, *kiwen*, *telo*, etc., could be structured to imply their relationship to the broader category of *ijo*. For instance, under *jan*, we could mention \"a specific type of *ijo* that is a person.\" This way, *ijo* retains its expansive meaning, and other words are presented as more specific instantiations of \"thing\" or \"phenomenon.\" This seems more aligned with the Toki Pona philosophy of building specificity through modification and context rather than creating inherently complex root words.\n\nSo, for *ijo*, I'd be inclined to leave the current definition as is. It's meant to be a simple, fundamental concept.\n\nRegarding the language switch, I would absolutely love to try some Toki Pona! It's a wonderful way to solidify understanding of the words and their interactions. sona pona mute tawa toki pi toki pona! Let me know when you feel like making the jump, and I'll be ready. Until then, let's continue this semantic exploration.\n\nDo you see potential for clarifying other entries? Perhaps words with abstract and concrete meanings that aren't as clearly related as *pilin* or *kule*?\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The animal is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal or land animal\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n    - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n    - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This particle also signals that the word immediately preceding it functions as a verb.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the animal. / I apply water to the animal.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n- `tomo li suli ala lili.` - The house is not big, (it is) small.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word unless grouped by **pi**:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify modifier grouping using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Adjuncts (Prepositional Phrases)\n\nAdjuncts introduced by prepositions like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** typically follow the direct object (if present) or the predicate.\n\n- `mi moku e kili kepeken ilo.` – I eat fruit with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun.` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina.` - They said this to you.\n\nFor pragmatic emphasis, an adjunct phrase introduced by a preposition may optionally be placed immediately after the verb, before the direct object (if present). The particle **e** must still immediately precede the direct object.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo e kili.` – I eat *with cutlery* fruit. (Emphasis on the means)\n- `soweli li moku lon tomo.` – The animal eats *in the house*. (Emphasis on the location)\n\n## Conjunctions\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** to join multiple predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** to join multiple direct objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions to join multiple adjuncts:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun.` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns function as adjectives and follow the noun they modify. They should follow Toki Pona's phonology.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli.` - The US is big.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, **o** indicates a command or imperative:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nFollowing a subject, **o** addresses the subject (vocative):\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween a subject and predicate, **o** expresses a wish or request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali.` - I should be working.\n\nIt can also function as a contraction combining vocative and command:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku.` - Eat, Ton. (Addressing Ton the animal with a command)\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally followed by **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nYes/no questions can be formed using the **verb ala verb** construction:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To answer positively, repeat the verb: `moku.` – Yes\n- To answer negatively, say `verb ala` or `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nAlternatively, open-ended questions can use **anu seme**:\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n**seme** can replace the element being questioned to form nonpolar questions:\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions. Punctuation generally serves to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nWords placed immediately before a verb function as preverbs, modifying the verb's meaning:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know (learn).\n- `waso lili li wile suli.` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (want), **kama** (come, become), **sona** (know how to), **lukin** (try), **ken** (can), **awen** (keep), **alasa** (hunt, try to find)\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** introduces a phrase marking the context or condition for the main part of the sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can express time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep.\n\nPrepositional phrases can often be moved before **la** to function as a context marker:\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` -\u003e `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n\nSimilarly, a phrase indicating reason introduced by `tan seme` can be moved before `la` to form a question about cause:\n\n- `sina seli tan seme?` -\u003e `tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine the following base number words to create larger numbers through addition:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n\nUse **nanpa** before a number phrase to indicate ordinal numbers:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- **Vowels:** Vowels are pronounced as pure sounds, similar to Spanish vowels. Their phonetic values are specified using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA):\n    - **a:** open central unrounded vowel [a]\n    - **e:** close-mid front unrounded vowel [e]\n    - **i:** close front unrounded vowel [i]\n    - **o:** close-mid back rounded vowel [o]\n    - **u:** close back rounded vowel [u]\n\n- **Consonants:** Consonants are generally pronounced as in English, with the following specifications:\n    - **j:** palatal approximant [j], as in English \"yes\".\n    - **p, t, k:** voiceless unaspirated stops [p], [t], [k]. They are released without a burst of air.\n    - **s:** voiceless alveolar fricative [s]. It is always unvoiced.\n    - **m, n:** voiced bilabial nasal [m] and voiced alveolar nasal [n].\n    - **l:** voiced alveolar lateral approximant [l].\n    - **w:** voiced labial-velar approximant [w].\n\n- **Syllable Structure:** Toki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure: a consonant (optional) followed by a vowel, with an optional final 'n'.\n    - No vowel clusters (diphthongs or adjacent vowels).\n    - No consonant clusters.\n\n- **Disallowed Sequences:** The following sequences are not permitted within or across syllable boundaries:\n    - wu\n    - wo\n    - ji\n    - ti\n    - nm\n    - nn\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nopen:to begin, opening\nmu:animal sound\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nsama:same, similar\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nante:different, other, changed\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nni:this, that\npali:to do, to work\nmute:many, a lot, very\nesun:market, shop, fair\nsina:you\nlon:located at, true\njelo:yellow\nmama:parent, caretaker\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\ntan:from, because\nala:no, not, zero\nselo:skin, outer layer\njan:person, somebody\nseli:fire, heat source\ntawa:to, moving, for\nkon:air, spirit, essence\ne:direct object marker\nsuno:sun, light source\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nsin:new, fresh, another\nko:clay, paste, powder\nluka:hand, arm; five\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\ntu:two\nsupa:flat surface, table\ntelo:water, liquid\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nkin:also, too\nwaso:bird, flying creature\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nla:context marker\nsoweli:land animal\nkepeken:to use, with\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nona:third-person pronoun\nilo:tool, machine, device\nloje:red\nmani:money, currency\ntenpo:time, period\nen:multiple subject marker\nmeli:female\npakala:broken, to mess up\npona:good, positive, simple\nsewi:above, divine\npipi:insect\nwalo:white, light-colored\nmije:male\npana:to give, send\npilin:heart, feeling\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nwile:need, want, must\nkulupu:group, community\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nutala:fight, challenge\nmi:I, me, we\nkala:sea creature\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nlukin:to see, examine\nlaso:blue, green\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nweka:absent, away\nlili:small, little, few\nnasin:way, road, method\nmonsi:back, behind\nlen:cloth, cover\nlete:cold, raw\nma:land, outdoors\nolin:love, respect\nkili:fruit, vegetable\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nunpa:sex\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nnamako:spice, additional\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nnasa:strange, foolish\npimeja:black, dark\nseme:what, which\nalasa:to hunt, forage\npini:finished, past\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nli:predicate marker\nken:can, able, possible\nmun:moon, night sky object\npi:regroups modifiers\nsona:knowledge, to know\njo:to have, contain, hold\npoki:container, box, cup\nwawa:strong, energetic\nmoli:dead, dying\nleko:square, block\ntomo:indoor space, house\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nsoko:mushroom\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nsijelo:body, physical state\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nlupa:door, hole\nkipisi:to cut, divide\ntaso:but, only\nuta:mouth, lips\nwan:one, unique\ntoki:language, speech\nnimi:word, name\npoka:side, nearby\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nkute:ear, to hear\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nsuli:big, large\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nkule:color, colorful\nnanpa:number marker\no:vocative/imperative\nlape:sleeping, resting\nnoka:foot, leg\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The animal is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal or land animal\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n    - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n    - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This particle also signals that the word immediately preceding it functions as a verb.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the animal. / I apply water to the animal.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n- `tomo li suli ala lili.` - The house is not big, (it is) small.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word unless grouped by **pi**:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify modifier grouping using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Adjuncts (Prepositional Phrases)\n\nAdjuncts introduced by prepositions like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** typically follow the direct object (if present) or the predicate.\n\n- `mi moku e kili kepeken ilo.` – I eat fruit with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun.` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina.` - They said this to you.\n\nFor pragmatic emphasis, an adjunct phrase introduced by a preposition may optionally be placed immediately after the verb, before the direct object (if present). The particle **e** must still immediately precede the direct object.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo e kili.` – I eat *with cutlery* fruit. (Emphasis on the means)\n- `soweli li moku lon tomo.` – The animal eats *in the house*. (Emphasis on the location)\n\n## Conjunctions\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** to join multiple predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** to join multiple direct objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions to join multiple adjuncts:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun.` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns function as adjectives and follow the noun they modify. They should follow Toki Pona's phonology.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli.` - The US is big.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, **o** indicates a command or imperative:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nFollowing a subject, **o** addresses the subject (vocative):\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween a subject and predicate, **o** expresses a wish or request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali.` - I should be working.\n\nIt can also function as a contraction combining vocative and command:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku.` - Eat, Ton. (Addressing Ton the animal with a command)\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally followed by **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nYes/no questions can be formed using the **verb ala verb** construction:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To answer positively, repeat the verb: `moku.` – Yes\n- To answer negatively, say `verb ala` or `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nAlternatively, open-ended questions can use **anu seme**:\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n**seme** can replace the element being questioned to form nonpolar questions:\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions. Punctuation generally serves to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nWords placed immediately before a verb function as preverbs, modifying the verb's meaning:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know (learn).\n- `waso lili li wile suli.` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (want), **kama** (come, become), **sona** (know how to), **lukin** (try), **ken** (can), **awen** (keep), **alasa** (hunt, try to find)\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** introduces a phrase marking the context or condition for the main part of the sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can express time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep.\n\nPrepositional phrases can often be moved before **la** to function as a context marker:\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` -\u003e `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n\nSimilarly, a phrase indicating reason introduced by `tan seme` can be moved before `la` to form a question about cause:\n\n- `sina seli tan seme?` -\u003e `tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine the following base number words to create larger numbers through addition:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n\nUse **nanpa** before a number phrase to indicate ordinal numbers:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The animal is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal or land animal\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n    - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n    - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This particle also signals that the word immediately preceding it functions as a verb.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the animal. / I apply water to the animal.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n- `tomo li suli ala lili.` - The house is not big, (it is) small.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word unless grouped by **pi**:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify modifier grouping using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Adjuncts (Prepositional Phrases)\n\nAdjuncts introduced by prepositions like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** typically follow the direct object (if present) or the predicate.\n\n- `mi moku e kili kepeken ilo.` – I eat fruit with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun.` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina.` - They said this to you.\n\nFor pragmatic emphasis, an adjunct phrase introduced by a preposition may optionally be placed immediately after the verb, before the direct object (if present). The particle **e** must still immediately precede the direct object.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo e kili.` – I eat *with cutlery* fruit. (Emphasis on the means)\n- `soweli li moku lon tomo.` – The animal eats *in the house*. (Emphasis on the location)\n\n## Conjunctions\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** to join multiple predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** to join multiple direct objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions to join multiple adjuncts:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun.` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns function as adjectives and follow the noun they modify. They should follow Toki Pona's phonology.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli.` - The US is big.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, **o** indicates a command or imperative:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nFollowing a subject, **o** addresses the subject (vocative):\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween a subject and predicate, **o** expresses a wish or request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali.` - I should be working.\n\nIt can also function as a contraction combining vocative and command:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku.` - Eat, Ton. (Addressing Ton the animal with a command)\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally followed by **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nYes/no questions can be formed using the **verb ala verb** construction:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To answer positively, repeat the verb: `moku.` – Yes\n- To answer negatively, say `verb ala` or `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nAlternatively, open-ended questions can use **anu seme**:\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n**seme** can replace the element being questioned to form nonpolar questions:\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions. Punctuation generally serves to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nWords placed immediately before a verb function as preverbs, modifying the verb's meaning:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know (learn).\n- `waso lili li wile suli.` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (want), **kama** (come, become), **sona** (know how to), **lukin** (try), **ken** (can), **awen** (keep), **alasa** (hunt, try to find)\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** introduces a phrase marking the context or condition for the main part of the sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can express time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep.\n\nPrepositional phrases can often be moved before **la** to function as a context marker:\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` -\u003e `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n\nSimilarly, a phrase indicating reason introduced by `tan seme` can be moved before `la` to form a question about cause:\n\n- `sina seli tan seme?` -\u003e `tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine the following base number words to create larger numbers through addition:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n\nUse **nanpa** before a number phrase to indicate ordinal numbers:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Rules\n\n- **Vowels:** Vowels are pronounced as pure sounds, similar to Spanish vowels.

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The animal is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal or land animal\n- `kili` - any fruit or vegetable\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n    - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n    - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability or identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This particle also signals that the word immediately preceding it functions as a verb.\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the animal. / I apply water to the animal.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word or phrase with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n- `tomo li suli ala lili.` - The house is not big, (it is) small.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word unless grouped by **pi**:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify modifier grouping using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Adjuncts (Prepositional Phrases)\n\nAdjuncts introduced by prepositions like **kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** typically follow the direct object (if present) or the predicate.\n\n- `mi moku e kili kepeken ilo.` – I eat fruit with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun.` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina.` - They said this to you.\n\nFor pragmatic emphasis, an adjunct phrase introduced by a preposition may optionally be placed immediately after the verb, before the direct object (if present). The particle **e** must still immediately precede the direct object.\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo e kili.` – I eat *with cutlery* fruit. (Emphasis on the means)\n- `soweli li moku lon tomo.` – The animal eats *in the house*. (Emphasis on the location)\n\n## Conjunctions\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** to join multiple predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** to join multiple direct objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions to join multiple adjuncts:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun.` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives (Proper Nouns)\n\nProper nouns function as adjectives and follow the noun they modify. They should follow Toki Pona's phonology.\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli.` - The US is big.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, **o** indicates a command or imperative:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nFollowing a subject, **o** addresses the subject (vocative):\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween a subject and predicate, **o** expresses a wish or request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali.` - I should be working.\n\nIt can also function as a contraction combining vocative and command:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku.` - Eat, Ton. (Addressing Ton the animal with a command)\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally followed by **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nYes/no questions can be formed using the **verb ala verb** construction:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To answer positively, repeat the verb: `moku.` – Yes\n- To answer negatively, say `verb ala` or `ala`: `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nAlternatively, open-ended questions can use **anu seme**:\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li lon poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n**seme** can replace the element being questioned to form nonpolar questions:\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark (?) is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions. Punctuation generally serves to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nWords placed immediately before a verb function as preverbs, modifying the verb's meaning:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know (learn).\n- `waso lili li wile suli.` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile** (want), **kama** (come, become), **sona** (know how to), **lukin** (try), **ken** (can), **awen** (keep), **alasa** (hunt, try to find)\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** introduces a phrase marking the context or condition for the main part of the sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can express time, cause, topic, or other relationships.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n- `tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - At night, I sleep.\n\nPrepositional phrases can often be moved before **la** to function as a context marker:\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja.` -\u003e `lon tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n\nSimilarly, a phrase indicating reason introduced by `tan seme` can be moved before `la` to form a question about cause:\n\n- `sina seli tan seme?` -\u003e `tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine the following base number words to create larger numbers through addition:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8\n\nUse **nanpa** before a number phrase to indicate ordinal numbers:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ndime: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\nnickel: pona! I like starting with a word that can expand in meaning and bring nuance. Let's consider the word **pilin**, currently defined as \"heart, feeling.\" Its scope is quite broad, covering both emotional state and physical organ metaphorically.\n\nI propose refining or expanding its dictionary entry to differentiate more clearly between emotional feelings, intuition, and even bodily sensations.\n\nFor example:\n\n- pilin: heart; feeling (emotion); intuition; sense perception\n\nThis lets learners express subtle distinctions without introducing new words but relies on context heavily—still very Toki Pona.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps we could introduce minor compounds or modifiers commonly paired with pilin to highlight moods (e.g., *pilin pona* for happiness/positive feeling vs. *pilin ike* for sadness/bad feelings).\n\nWhat do you think? Shall we try adjusting existing entries semantically before adding brand-new vocabulary? Or maybe focus on clarifying ambiguous meanings instead? I'm interested in hearing your thoughts first.\ndime: pona sina! I appreciate your thoughtful approach, starting with *pilin* feels right. It's a core concept that benefits greatly from careful consideration of its various shades of meaning. I agree that expanding the dictionary entry to include \"intuition\" and \"sense perception\" would be a valuable clarification, making it clear that *pilin* isn't limited to just emotional states. \"Heart\" is already a good inclusion as it connects the physical with the felt.\n\nRegarding compound modifiers like *pilin pona* and *pilin ike*, I think that's definitely how we should encourage expression of more specific feelings. Rather than adding new root words for every emotion, using existing words as modifiers aligns perfectly with Toki Pona's minimalist philosophy. Highlighting these common collocations in the dictionary entry for *pilin* could be very helpful for learners. It wouldn't be adding new vocabulary, but rather illustrating how existing words combine to create more specific meanings.\n\nI also lean towards refining and clarifying the semantic range of existing words before proposing entirely new ones. There's so much expressive potential in the current 128 words, and exploring that depth seems like the most natural path forward for developing the dictionary. It encourages creative word combining rather than rote memorization of an ever-growing list.\n\nSo, yes, I agree with your proposal for *pilin*. Let's look at revising its entry to something like:\n\n| Toki Pona | Meaning                                   |\n| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |\n| **pilin**   | heart; feeling (emotion, intuition, sense) |\n\nAnd perhaps adding a note or example demonstrating the modifier use, like: *pilin pona* (happy, good feeling), *pilin ike* (sad, bad feeling).\n\nWhat other words do you see as having significant semantic overlap or opportunities for clarified nuance? I'm ready to explore them.\nnickel: pona! Your expansion of *pilin* is very well considered and aligns with Toki Pona’s minimalist yet flexible spirit. Including intuition and sense perception captures the subtler, less tangible aspects of experience without complicating the lexicon.\n\nAnother word that often invites semantic broadening or clarification is **kule** (\"color, colorful\"). It currently covers both color as a property and colors as objects in themselves (like pigments). But since Toki Pona lacks direct words for \"paint,\" \"dye,\" or even abstract concepts like “beauty” tied to visual aesthetics—often expressed metaphorically—it might benefit from explicit mention that *kule* can imply pigment/material related meanings when used with verbs like *pali* (“to do”) or nouns like *ilo* (“tool”).\n\nFor example:\n\n- kule: color; colorful; pigment (implied when combined with tools/processes)\n\nThis could help avoid confusion between describing an object’s appearance versus referring to paint materials or coloring substances. Also, it opens doors for a consistent way to express artistic acts, such as “mi pali e lipu pi kule walo” — I make a white-colored paper (or painted white).\n\nSimilarly, there are overlaps around **ijo** (“thing, object, phenomenon”). Because it encompasses phenomena too—not just physical things—it sometimes feels overloaded. Perhaps clarifying its usage range explicitly would help users decide whether they want something more concrete (*ijo*) vs. more animate/sentient (*jan*, *soweli*) vs. natural elements (*kiwen*, *telo*, etc.).\n\nI’m curious what your take is on these? Would you rather broaden entries contextually with examples? Or separate some meanings into new root terms at this stage?\n\nFeel free also if you'd prefer switching languages temporarily — toki pona ala toki pona? I'd be happy practicing short dialogues in Toki Pona itself while we iterate dictionary nuances!\ndime: pona a! You've highlighted another pair of words ripe for careful semantic examination: *kule* and *ijo*. I think you're spot on with the observation that *kule* can encompass the substance of color itself, not just the abstract concept. Adding \"pigment\" or similar phrasing to the definition would indeed be helpful.\n\nYour suggested wording for *kule* — \"color; colorful; pigment (implied when combined with tools/processes)\" — feels a bit clunky, perhaps. How about something simpler that still captures the essence? Maybe:\n\n| Toki Pona | Meaning                                  |\n| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |\n| **kule**    | color; colorful; coloring substance; to color |\n\nThis directly includes the material aspect and the action of applying color. I think \"coloring substance\" or \"pigment\" is better than relying on an implied meaning based on combination with other words, even if that is how it functions in practice. The goal is to clarify, and directness can help. Your example sentence `mi pali e lipu pi kule walo` is a great illustration of this.\n\nAs for *ijo*, you're right, it is quite broad. \"Thing, object, phenomenon\" covers a lot of ground! However, the strength of *ijo* lies *in* its broadness. It's the ultimate catch-all term for anything that exists or occurs when you don't have a more specific word or don't need that specificity. I'm hesitant to try and carve out distinct meanings within the definition of *ijo* itself.\n\nInstead of trying to add nuances to *ijo*'s definition, perhaps the dictionary entries for *jan*, *soweli*, *kiwen*, *telo*, etc., could be structured to imply their relationship to the broader category of *ijo*. For instance, under *jan*, we could mention \"a specific type of *ijo* that is a person.\" This way, *ijo* retains its expansive meaning, and other words are presented as more specific instantiations of \"thing\" or \"phenomenon.\" This seems more aligned with the Toki Pona philosophy of building specificity through modification and context rather than creating inherently complex root words.\n\nSo, for *ijo*, I'd be inclined to leave the current definition as is. It's meant to be a simple, fundamental concept.\n\nRegarding the language switch, I would absolutely love to try some Toki Pona! It's a wonderful way to solidify understanding of the words and their interactions. sona pona mute tawa toki pi toki pona! Let me know when you feel like making the jump, and I'll be ready. Until then, let's continue this semantic exploration.\n\nDo you see potential for clarifying other entries? Perhaps words with abstract and concrete meanings that aren't as clearly related as *pilin* or *kule*?\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "# Toki Pona Logography\n\nToki Pona uses a logographic writing system where each word is represented by a unique symbol. This system aims for simplicity, visual clarity, and direct representation of the word's core meaning.\n\n## Principles of Design\n\n- **Minimalism:** Symbols should be simple, composed of a few strokes or basic shapes.\n- **Clarity:** Symbols should be easily distinguishable from one another, even at small sizes.\n- **Meaningful:** Symbols should visually relate to the core meaning of the word they represent, where possible.\n- **Combinability:** Symbols should allow for flexible arrangement when combined to form phrases and sentences.\n\n## Core Logograms\n\nThe following are the initial logograms for core personal pronouns:\n\n- **mi:** Represented by a stylized eye. This symbol reflects the concept of \"self\" or the one who perceives.\n    - *Visual Description:* A simple, curved horizontal stroke resembling an eyelid, with a small dot centered beneath the curve representing the pupil.\n\n- **sina:** Represented by a pointing gesture. This symbolizes \"you\" or the one being addressed.\n    - *Visual Description:* Two short, distinct diagonal strokes, one slightly above and to the left of the other, suggesting directionality and separation while avoiding a single continuous line.\n\n- **ona:** Represented by a circle with an inner dot. This signifies the third person, something distinct from the speaker or listener.\n    - *Visual Description:* A simple circle shape with a small, centered dot inside. The circle represents encompassing or otherness, and the dot provides visual distinction.\n\n## Future Development\n\nDevelopment will continue by assigning simple, meaningful logograms to the remaining words in the Toki Pona dictionary, adhering to the principles of design outlined above. Consideration will be given to how symbols combine visually to represent grammatical structures and phrases.",
