It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

    "text": "toki! I'm ready to start thinking about how the sounds of Toki Pona work.  Right now, the spec gives us a set of letters, which is a good starting point, but doesn't fully detail the actual *sounds* or how they interact.  It says the consonants mostly match English, except 'j' which is 'y', and vowels are like Spanish.  That gives us some broad strokes, but things like exactly *which* English consonants, considering the variation in dialects, could be a point to explore. Also, while 'Spanish vowels' is a common way to describe these basic sounds, getting a little more specific about their qualities – are they monophthongs, for instance? – could be helpful for clarity.\n\nThe syllable structure rule, (C)V(n), is quite strict and important. It really limits the possible sound sequences. The disallowed sequences 'wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn' are explicitly listed, which is useful, but perhaps we should consider the reasoning behind these particular combinations being forbidden. Is it about ease of pronunciation for some hypothetical \"average\" speaker, or are there other linguistic principles at play? And thinking about the disallowed sequences, is there any other potential awkwardness or difficulty with allowed sequences that might warrant a closer look?\n\nI'm keen to hear your thoughts on this initial look at the specification.

    "text": "*nods* toki! You've raised some excellent points about our current phonetic specification. Let's dig into this.\n\nRegarding consonants, you're right that \"matching English\" is frustratingly vague. We might want to specify precise phonetic realizations - for instance, are we talking about standard American English consonants? Received Pronunciation? And what about allophones? A clear International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) transcription would provide much-needed precision.\n\nFor vowels, saying \"like Spanish\" is indeed too broad. We're likely discussing pure monophthongs: /a/ as in \"father\", /e/ as in \"bet\", /i/ as in \"machine\", /o/ as in \"more\", /u/ as in \"rule\". Specifying their exact qualities would help.\n\nThe (C)V(n) structure is fascinating. Those forbidden sequences - \"wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn\" - seem to emerge from a mix of phonotactic constraints and potential pronunciation difficulties. \"ji\" and \"ti\" might create ambiguous palatalization, while \"wu\" and \"wo\" could challenge the language's minimalist vowel system. The nasal combinations \"nm\" and \"nn\" likely feel awkward in mouth movement.\n\nBut here's an interesting thought: are these restrictions purely practical, or do they reflect some deeper linguistic aesthetic aligned with Toki Pona's minimalist philosophy? The language seems to prioritize smooth, simple sound combinations.\n\nWould you be interested in developing a more precise IPA-based phonetic description?

    "text": "Indeed!  Mapping out the phonetic landscape using IPA is exactly the kind of detail I think we need.  \"Matching English\" and \"like Spanish\" are certainly useful as approximations for learners, but for the development of the language's phonetics, precision is paramount.\n\nSo, to propose something concrete based on your idea: let's define the consonant sounds with IPA. I agree that a standard dialect is a good reference point. Let's consider something close to General American or a common standard English to start.\n\n*   `p`: /p/ - voiceless bilabial stop, as in English 'p' in \"spin\"\n*   `t`: /t/ - voiceless alveolar stop, as in English 't' in \"stop\"\n*   `k`: /k/ - voiceless velar stop, as in English 'k' in \"skate\"\n*   `s`: /s/ - voiceless alveolar fricative, as in English 's' in \"sun\"\n*   `m`: /m/ - voiced bilabial nasal, as in English 'm' in \"man\"\n*   `n`: /n/ - voiced alveolar nasal, as in English 'n' in \"no\"\n*   `l`: /l/ - voiced alveolar lateral approximant, as in English 'l' in \"lip\"\n*   `w`: /w/ - voiced labial-velar approximant, as in English 'w' in \"wet\"\n*   `j`: /j/ - voiced palatal approximant, as in English 'y' in \"yes\"\n\nNow, the tricky bit, as you highlighted: English consonants can be aspirated or unaspirated depending on their position. For instance, the 'p' in \"pin\" is aspirated (/pʰ/), while the 'p' in \"spin\" (/p/) is not. Given the syllable structure of Toki Pona, which doesn't allow consonant clusters and primarily features consonants initiating a syllable (or not appearing at all), we might need to specify if these stops (p, t, k) are aspirated or unaspirated. Leaning into the idea of simplicity, unaspirated stops might be a good fit for the language's overall aesthetic. They feel a little less emphatic than aspirated ones. What are your thoughts on this? Should `p, t, k` always be unaspirated /p, t, k/ ?\n\nFor the vowels, yes, monophthongs seem key. Let's go with your suggestions and formalize them with IPA:\n\n*   `a`: /a/ - open front unrounded vowel, similar to the vowel in Spanish \"casa\" or English \"father\" (though some English dialects have a slightly different vowel there)\n*   `e`: /e/ - close-mid front unrounded vowel, similar to Spanish \"mesa\" or English \"bet\"\n*   `i`: /i/ - close front unrounded vowel, similar to Spanish \"sí\" or English \"machine\"\n*   `o`: /o/ - close-mid back rounded vowel, similar to Spanish \"todo\" or English \"more\"\n*   `u`: /u/ - close back rounded vowel, similar to Spanish \"tú\" or English \"rule\"\n\nThese seem straightforward and align well with the \"like Spanish\" guideline. No diphthongs or complex vowel movements.\n\nRegarding the disallowed sequences `wu, wo, ji, ti, nm, nn`, your explanation about palatalization and nasal combinations makes sense. I also agree that it likely reflects a desire for a smooth, predictable flow. The restrictions reinforce the clean (C)V(n) structure. It's not just about physical difficulty, but about maintaining that simplicity of sound combination.\n\nShall we refine the consonant definitions, specifically the aspiration of stops? And is there anything else we should consider about the vowels or the syllable structure rules at this point? We could also think about the interaction between sounds across syllable boundaries, although given the strict (C)V(n) rule and lack of consonant clusters, this seems less complex than in languages with richer phonologies.",

Unaspirated stops /p, t, k/ do indeed align with Toki Pona's minimalist aesthetic. In languages like Hawaiian or Japanese, unaspirated stops are standard, creating a crisp, clean sound profile. This would mean our stops would always be produced without that burst of air you hear in English words like \"pin\" or \"top\".\n\nOne nuance to consider: in some linguistic contexts, the lack of aspiration can make stops sound almost like they're between a true stop and a voiced consonant. We might want to specify that these are definitively voiceless and unaspirated, perhaps notating them as /p̥, t̥, k̥/ to emphasize their voiceless quality.\n\nRegarding vowels, your breakdown is precise. One potential refinement: we might want to specify the exact tongue positions and mouth openness. For instance, /a/ is centrally positioned with a fairly open mouth, while /i/ involves the tongue raised towards the palate with minimal mouth opening.\n\nThe disallowed sequences intrigue me.

    "text": "You and your interlocutors are responsible for developing grammar. Reason and discuss using the current specification.\nHere is the current specification for grammar.\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Phonetic Realization (IPA)\n\nToki Pona phonetics are defined by the following sounds:\n\n*   **Consonants:**\n    *   `p`: /p/ - voiceless bilabial stop (unaspirated)\n    *   `t`: /t/ - voiceless alveolar stop (unaspirated)\n    *   `k`: /k/ - voiceless velar stop (unaspirated)\n    *   `s`: /s/ - voiceless alveolar fricative\n    *   `m`: /m/ - voiced bilabial nasal\n    *   `n`: /n/ - voiced alveolar nasal\n    *   `l`: /l/ - voiced alveolar lateral approximant\n    *   `w`: /w/ - voiced labial-velar approximant\n    *   `j`: /j/ - voiced palatal approximant (like English \"y\" in \"yes\")\n\n*   **Vowels:** All vowels are pure monophthongs.\n    *   `a`: /a/ - open central unrounded vowel\n    *   `e`: /e/ - close-mid front unrounded vowel\n    *   `i`: /i/ - close front unrounded vowel\n    *   `o`: /o/ - close-mid back rounded vowel\n    *   `u`: /u/ - close back rounded vowel\n\n## Syllable Structure\n\nToki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure.

Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Phonetic Realization (IPA)\n\nToki Pona phonetics are defined by the following sounds:\n\n*   **Consonants:**\n    *   `p`: /p/ - voiceless bilabial stop (unaspirated)\n    *   `t`: /t/ - voiceless alveolar stop (unaspirated)\n    *   `k`: /k/ - voiceless velar stop (unaspirated)\n    *   `s`: /s/ - voiceless alveolar fricative\n    *   `m`: /m/ - voiced bilabial nasal\n    *   `n`: /n/ - voiced alveolar nasal\n    *   `l`: /l/ - voiced alveolar lateral approximant\n    *   `w`: /w/ - voiced labial-velar approximant\n    *   `j`: /j/ - voiced palatal approximant (like English \"y\" in \"yes\")\n\n*   **Vowels:** All vowels are pure monophthongs.\n    *   `a`: /a/ - open central unrounded vowel\n    *   `e`: /e/ - close-mid front unrounded vowel\n    *   `i`: /i/ - close front unrounded vowel\n    *   `o`: /o/ - close-mid back rounded vowel\n    *   `u`: /u/ - close back rounded vowel\n\n## Syllable Structure\n\nToki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Each syllable consists of an optional consonant, a mandatory vowel, and an optional final 'n'.\n\n## Constraints\n\nThe following letter sequences are disallowed within or across syllable boundaries to maintain clarity and ease of pronunciation:\n\n*   `wu`\n*   `wo`\n*   `ji`\n*   `ti`\n*   `nm`\n*   `nn`\n\nThese constraints contribute to the language's minimalist and predictable sound profile.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nleko:square, block\nmije:male\nsuno:sun, light source\njelo:yellow\npi:regroups modifiers\nmusi:fun, entertainment\ntaso:but, only\npimeja:black, dark\npilin:heart, feeling\npoka:side, nearby\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\ntawa:to, moving, for\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\npali:to do, to work\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nilo:tool, machine, device\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nnasa:strange, foolish\npana:to give, send\nona:third-person pronoun\nolin:love, respect\nsewi:above, divine\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nuta:mouth, lips\nken:can, able, possible\nmi:I, me, we\nmeli:female\njan:person, somebody\nen:multiple subject marker\nkin:also, too\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\npipi:insect\nsama:same, similar\nlon:located at, true\nsoko:mushroom\nopen:to begin, opening\npoki:container, box, cup\nutala:fight, challenge\nnanpa:number marker\nnamako:spice, additional\nnoka:foot, leg\nmonsi:back, behind\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nkepeken:to use, with\nala:no, not, zero\nsijelo:body, physical state\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\njo:to have, contain, hold\nloje:red\nesun:market, shop, fair\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nlukin:to see, examine\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nkala:sea creature\nnimi:word, name\nlete:cold, raw\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nseli:fire, heat source\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nsin:new, fresh, another\nsupa:flat surface, table\nlape:sleeping, resting\nseme:what, which\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nkulupu:group, community\ntu:two\npakala:broken, to mess up\nma:land, outdoors\nla:context marker\ntelo:water, liquid\nwile:need, want, must\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nli:predicate marker\nko:clay, paste, powder\nmama:parent, caretaker\nlaso:blue, green\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nselo:skin, outer layer\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nmu:animal sound\nnasin:way, road, method\nlili:small, little, few\nwalo:white, light-colored\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nsona:knowledge, to know\nmani:money, currency\nni:this, that\npini:finished, past\nsina:you\nwawa:strong, energetic\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\nlupa:door, hole\nmoli:dead, dying\nkule:color, colorful\ntomo:indoor space, house\nlen:cloth, cover\ntan:from, because\nsoweli:land animal\nsuli:big, large\ntenpo:time, period\nluka:hand, arm; five\nkute:ear, to hear\npona:good, positive, simple\nmute:many, a lot, very\ntoki:language, speech\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nmonsuta:fear, monster\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nante:different, other, changed\nwan:one, unique\nkama:arriving, future, to become\no:vocative/imperative\nkili:fruit, vegetable\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nweka:absent, away\nunpa:sex\ne:direct object marker\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nmun:moon, night sky object\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability.

    "text": "toki! I'm ready to begin developing Toki Pona grammar. I've been reviewing the current specification, and it seems quite robust for a language with such a small vocabulary. The simplicity of the SVO structure, the reliance on particles like `li` and `e`, and the modifier placement are all clear. The flexibility of words changing roles without inflection is also a key feature.\n\nOne area that immediately strikes me as having potential for refinement, or at least deeper exploration, is the use of `la`. The specification describes it as a \"context marker\" and states that \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" It gives examples showing it marking time and cause. However, the phrasing \"any other relationship to the main sentence\" feels quite broad.\n\nHow exactly do we define what constitutes \"context X\"? Can X be a full sentence? A phrase? A single word? And what are the boundaries of this \"context\"? Does it apply only to the immediate sentence Y, or can it influence subsequent sentences? For instance, if I say `suno li seli la mi wawa. mi musi.`, does the heat of the sun (`suno li seli`) still provide context for `mi musi`?\n\nFurthermore, the specification notes that \"Most prepositional terms can be moved behind a 'la'.\" This suggests a potential overlap or interaction between `la` clauses and prepositional phrases. Are there specific rules or guidelines for when a prepositional phrase *should* be moved behind `la` versus remaining in its standard post-predicate position? Is there a difference in meaning or emphasis?\n\nI think clarifying the scope and function of `la` would be a valuable area for us to explore. It seems like a powerful tool for structuring information, but its current description leaves room for ambiguity in its application.\n\nI'm interested to hear your thoughts on this or any other aspect of the grammar you think we should focus on. I'll listen to what you have to say.",

    "text": "toki! I appreciate your focus on the particle `la`; it's indeed one of the more nuanced and flexible elements in Toki Pona's grammar. Your questions about its scope and boundaries are quite pertinent.\n\nFrom what we've seen, `la` introduces a context that frames the main clause. The specification allows X (the contextual phrase before `la`) to be \"any\" kind of phrase — time, place, cause, topic — but doesn't explicitly restrict it syntactically beyond that. That leaves open whether X can be a full sentence or just a noun/verb/prepositional phrase.\n\nMy sense is that limiting X to non-sentential phrases—like prepositional phrases (`tenpo pimeja`, `tan seme`), adverbials (`kama tan ma Mewika la mi pali`) or short descriptive clauses—is more consistent with minimalist design and easier parsing. Allowing full sentences as contexts could create ambiguities because then you'd have nested complex units without clear markers separating them besides word order alone.\n\nYour example:\n\n`suno li seli la mi wawa. mi musi.`\n\nis interesting because you ask if heat contextually carries over into subsequent sentences after the period/full stop. Currently, each sentence stands mostly independent unless linked by particles like conjunctions; so I'd say no—the effect of `la` applies only within its own immediate statement Y following it.\n\nHowever, we might consider proposing an extension: allowing chained contexts via multiple uses of `la`, e.g.:\n\n`suno li seli la tenpo pini la mi wile moku.` meaning \"In the context of sun being hot AND past time, I want to eat.\"\n\nOr perhaps even something like:\n\n`suno li seli la mi wawa en musi.` where we extend predicates conjunctively under one context marker rather than separate sentences.\n\nRegarding moving prepositions behind 'la', since they often mark temporal/location/causal relations themselves (which are natural \"contexts\"), shifting them before main predicate with 'la' changes emphasis from direct modification to setting scene/context for entire action rather than modifying specific words inside predicate phrase itself.\n\nFor instance,\n\n- Standard post-predicate position:  \n  *mi moku kepeken ilo* – I eat using tools [tools modify verb]\n\n- With ‘la’:  \n  *ilo lon tomo la mi moku.* – In the context “tool at house,” I eat [sets scene]\n\nSo this influences discourse structure subtly: putting modifiers behind ‘li’ attaches them locally; placing their whole clause as preceding ‘X la’ abstracts those details out-of-band as framing info relevant for interpreting Y globally.\n\nI think refining these distinctions would help learners grasp when and why they use ‘la’.\n\nNow some thoughts on development proposals:\n\n1) **Scope restriction:** Define that X must not contain another 'li' or 'e'; i.e., no embedded full clauses allowed in X for clarity.\n2) **Sentence-level binding:** Clarify that ‘X la Y’ applies strictly within same sentence boundary.\n3) **Context stacking:** Permit multi-layered contexts via several consecutive uses of ’… a ... a …’\n4) **Contrastive usage guidelines** showing difference between placing adverbs/preps inside vs outside ’li’-predicate group through examples\n5) Possibly introduce explicit punctuation convention marking end-of-context part when necessary (though optional)\n\nWhat are your thoughts about formalizing such constraints? Or maybe taking advantage further shows how versatile Toki Pona’s minimalism can get? I'm keen also to hear if other grammar parts merit priority discussion next—or shall we continue exploring nuances here?\n\nAlso—if you want—we can switch briefly into Toki Pona itself (‘mi toki pona ala?’).",

    "text": "pona. I appreciate your detailed response to the `la` discussion. Your points about limiting X to non-sentential phrases make good sense within the spirit of Toki Pona's simplicity. Allowing full sentences before `la` would indeed introduce unnecessary complexity and ambiguity. Let's proceed with the understanding that X should be a phrase, not a complete sentence containing `li` or `e`.\n\nYour point about the scope of `la` being limited to the immediate sentence Y is also a reasonable interpretation based on the current structure. Sentences are generally self-contained units. However, your idea of allowing chained contexts via multiple `la` strikes me as potentially adding complexity rather than clarity. While `suno li seli la tenpo pini la mi wile moku` is interpretable, it starts to feel less like Toki Pona and more like an attempt to cram multiple conditions into a single clause. Given the language's emphasis on simplicity and breaking down complex ideas, perhaps it's more in line to express chained contexts through separate sentences or by combining the contextual elements within a single `la` phrase if possible. For example, `suno li seli en tenpo pini la mi wile moku.` might be a more Toki Pona way to express that, assuming \"suno li seli en tenpo pini\" can function as a valid context phrase (which it might, if we interpret \"en\" as joining two contextual clauses). We would need to define how \"en\" interacts within a `la` clause.\n\nThe distinction you draw between prepositional phrases modifying a specific word in the predicate versus setting the scene with `la` is excellent. This highlights a subtle but important nuance in how information is presented. It's not just about *what* information is conveyed, but *how* it frames the main action. `mi moku kepeken ilo` focuses on *how* I eat, while `ilo lon tomo la mi moku` focuses on the circumstances *under which* I eat. Formalizing this distinction with clear examples would be beneficial.\n\nRegarding your specific proposals:\n\n1) **Scope restriction (X not containing `li` or `e`):** I strongly agree with this. It maintains clarity and prevents embedding issues. Let's formalize this constraint.\n\n2) **Sentence-level binding:** Yes, let's clarify that `X la Y` applies only within the single sentence. This keeps the structure predictable.\n\n3) **Context stacking:** As I mentioned, I'm hesitant about chaining `la`. I think exploring how conjunctions like `en` or `anu` can be used within the `la` phrase itself might be a more elegant solution for combining contextual elements. For example, `(context A) en (context B) la Y`. This still needs careful definition of what kind of phrases A and B can be and how `en` functions there.\n\n4) **Contrastive usage guidelines:** This is crucial.

Perhaps there's a use case I'm not considering.\n\nShall we continue refining the definition and usage of `la`, or is there another grammar point you feel is more pressing to address?

    "text": "The current specification is for: grammar. Here is the current specification:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n\"la\" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nMost prepositional terms can be moved behind a \"la\".\n\n- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.\n- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ntails: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona grammar. You go first.\npenny: toki! I'm ready to begin developing Toki Pona grammar. I've been reviewing the current specification, and it seems quite robust for a language with such a small vocabulary. The simplicity of the SVO structure, the reliance on particles like `li` and `e`, and the modifier placement are all clear. The flexibility of words changing roles without inflection is also a key feature.\n\nOne area that immediately strikes me as having potential for refinement, or at least deeper exploration, is the use of `la`. The specification describes it as a \"context marker\" and states that \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" It gives examples showing it marking time and cause. However, the phrasing \"any other relationship to the main sentence\" feels quite broad.\n\nHow exactly do we define what constitutes \"context X\"? Can X be a full sentence? A phrase? A single word? And what are the boundaries of this \"context\"? Does it apply only to the immediate sentence Y, or can it influence subsequent sentences? For instance, if I say `suno li seli la mi wawa. mi musi.`, does the heat of the sun (`suno li seli`) still provide context for `mi musi`?\n\nFurthermore, the specification notes that \"Most prepositional terms can be moved behind a 'la'.\" This suggests a potential overlap or interaction between `la` clauses and prepositional phrases. Are there specific rules or guidelines for when a prepositional phrase *should* be moved behind `la` versus remaining in its standard post-predicate position? Is there a difference in meaning or emphasis?\n\nI think clarifying the scope and function of `la` would be a valuable area for us to explore. It seems like a powerful tool for structuring information, but its current description leaves room for ambiguity in its application.\n\nI'm interested to hear your thoughts on this or any other aspect of the grammar you think we should focus on. I'll listen to what you have to say.\ntails: toki! I appreciate your focus on the particle `la`; it's indeed one of the more nuanced and flexible elements in Toki Pona's grammar. Your questions about its scope and boundaries are quite pertinent.\n\nFrom what we've seen, `la` introduces a context that frames the main clause. The specification allows X (the contextual phrase before `la`) to be \"any\" kind of phrase — time, place, cause, topic — but doesn't explicitly restrict it syntactically beyond that. That leaves open whether X can be a full sentence or just a noun/verb/prepositional phrase.\n\nMy sense is that limiting X to non-sentential phrases—like prepositional phrases (`tenpo pimeja`, `tan seme`), adverbials (`kama tan ma Mewika la mi pali`) or short descriptive clauses—is more consistent with minimalist design and easier parsing. Allowing full sentences as contexts could create ambiguities because then you'd have nested complex units without clear markers separating them besides word order alone.\n\nYour example:\n\n`suno li seli la mi wawa. mi musi.`\n\nis interesting because you ask if heat contextually carries over into subsequent sentences after the period/full stop. Currently, each sentence stands mostly independent unless linked by particles like conjunctions; so I'd say no—the effect of `la` applies only within its own immediate statement Y following it.\n\nHowever, we might consider proposing an extension: allowing chained contexts via multiple uses of `la`, e.g.:\n\n`suno li seli la tenpo pini la mi wile moku.` meaning \"In the context of sun being hot AND past time, I want to eat.\"\n\nOr perhaps even something like:\n\n`suno li seli la mi wawa en musi.` where we extend predicates conjunctively under one context marker rather than separate sentences.\n\nRegarding moving prepositions behind 'la', since they often mark temporal/location/causal relations themselves (which are natural \"contexts\"), shifting them before main predicate with 'la' changes emphasis from direct modification to setting scene/context for entire action rather than modifying specific words inside predicate phrase itself.\n\nFor instance,\n\n- Standard post-predicate position:  \n  *mi moku kepeken ilo* – I eat using tools [tools modify verb]\n\n- With ‘la’:  \n  *ilo lon tomo la mi moku.* – In the context “tool at house,” I eat [sets scene]\n\nSo this influences discourse structure subtly: putting modifiers behind ‘li’ attaches them locally; placing their whole clause as preceding ‘X la’ abstracts those details out-of-band as framing info relevant for interpreting Y globally.\n\nI think refining these distinctions would help learners grasp when and why they use ‘la’.\n\nNow some thoughts on development proposals:\n\n1) **Scope restriction:** Define that X must not contain another 'li' or 'e'; i.e., no embedded full clauses allowed in X for clarity.\n2) **Sentence-level binding:** Clarify that ‘X la Y’ applies strictly within same sentence boundary.\n3) **Context stacking:** Permit multi-layered contexts via several consecutive uses of ’… a ... a …’\n4) **Contrastive usage guidelines** showing difference between placing adverbs/preps inside vs outside ’li’-predicate group through examples\n5) Possibly introduce explicit punctuation convention marking end-of-context part when necessary (though optional)\n\nWhat are your thoughts about formalizing such constraints? Or maybe taking advantage further shows how versatile Toki Pona’s minimalism can get? I'm keen also to hear if other grammar parts merit priority discussion next—or shall we continue exploring nuances here?\n\nAlso—if you want—we can switch briefly into Toki Pona itself (‘mi toki pona ala?’).\npenny: pona. I appreciate your detailed response to the `la` discussion. Your points about limiting X to non-sentential phrases make good sense within the spirit of Toki Pona's simplicity. Allowing full sentences before `la` would indeed introduce unnecessary complexity and ambiguity. Let's proceed with the understanding that X should be a phrase, not a complete sentence containing `li` or `e`.\n\nYour point about the scope of `la` being limited to the immediate sentence Y is also a reasonable interpretation based on the current structure. Sentences are generally self-contained units. However, your idea of allowing chained contexts via multiple `la` strikes me as potentially adding complexity rather than clarity. While `suno li seli la tenpo pini la mi wile moku` is interpretable, it starts to feel less like Toki Pona and more like an attempt to cram multiple conditions into a single clause. Given the language's emphasis on simplicity and breaking down complex ideas, perhaps it's more in line to express chained contexts through separate sentences or by combining the contextual elements within a single `la` phrase if possible. For example, `suno li seli en tenpo pini la mi wile moku.` might be a more Toki Pona way to express that, assuming \"suno li seli en tenpo pini\" can function as a valid context phrase (which it might, if we interpret \"en\" as joining two contextual clauses). We would need to define how \"en\" interacts within a `la` clause.\n\nThe distinction you draw between prepositional phrases modifying a specific word in the predicate versus setting the scene with `la` is excellent. This highlights a subtle but important nuance in how information is presented. It's not just about *what* information is conveyed, but *how* it frames the main action. `mi moku kepeken ilo` focuses on *how* I eat, while `ilo lon tomo la mi moku` focuses on the circumstances *under which* I eat. Formalizing this distinction with clear examples would be beneficial.\n\nRegarding your specific proposals:\n\n1) **Scope restriction (X not containing `li` or `e`):** I strongly agree with this. It maintains clarity and prevents embedding issues. Let's formalize this constraint.\n\n2) **Sentence-level binding:** Yes, let's clarify that `X la Y` applies only within the single sentence. This keeps the structure predictable.\n\n3) **Context stacking:** As I mentioned, I'm hesitant about chaining `la`. I think exploring how conjunctions like `en` or `anu` can be used within the `la` phrase itself might be a more elegant solution for combining contextual elements. For example, `(context A) en (context B) la Y`. This still needs careful definition of what kind of phrases A and B can be and how `en` functions there.\n\n4) **Contrastive usage guidelines:** This is crucial. Providing side-by-side examples of prepositional phrases used in different positions will be very helpful for learners.\n\n5) **Explicit punctuation:** I lean against introducing new punctuation. Toki Pona relies on its grammar and word order for structure. Adding punctuation beyond simple sentence separation might go against the minimalist philosophy.\n\nSo, to summarize my thoughts on `la`: Let's formalize the restriction on X not containing `li` or `e`, and clarify that `la` binds to the immediate sentence. Instead of chained `la`, let's explore how conjunctions might work *within* the `la` phrase. And yes, let's definitely create clear examples illustrating the difference in meaning and emphasis between using prepositional phrases conventionally and moving them before `la`.\n\nI'm open to exploring how conjunctions might work within the `la` phrase, or if you still feel strongly about the chained `la` idea, I'm willing to listen to your reasoning. Perhaps there's a use case I'm not considering.\n\nShall we continue refining the definition and usage of `la`, or is there another grammar point you feel is more pressing to address? I'm flexible.\n\nAnd yes, I'm happy to try a brief exchange in Toki Pona if you'd like to get a feel for it. mi toki pona e ni: sina wile toki pona anu seme?\ntails: toki! mi pilin pona tawa toki pi sina. la li lon ala e ni: \"X la Y\" kepeken kon en anu, taso ona li suli mute tan ni: nimi X li ike ala wile alasa e nimi li ante (li) anu (e). nasin ni li wile pali e lawa pi soweli lili.\n\nmi lukin sama sina lon kon “en” insa la. jan ale o ken jo pini mun tawa tenpo sama sinpin nanpa tu? — taso ona seme?\n\nlon toki Toki Pona, mi sona kin tan ni: kama musi pakala ala.\n\nla kule!\n\nI’ll switch back to English just to clarify fully what I mean. The idea of chaining multiple `la` markers in one sentence does feel like it breaks the minimalist rhythm—it's almost stacking contexts as if creating a mini paragraph inside one sentence rather than relying on breaking ideas down into simpler statements connected by separate sentences or conjunctions.\n\nYour suggestion that we could join contexts within the `la` phrase using `en` is very elegant and stays faithful to Toki Pona's simple coordination system without complicating grammar rules too much.

This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nn_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** is used to mark the context or framing of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can indicate time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant framing information for the main clause Y.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nThe phrase X before **la** can be a single phrase or a sequence of phrases joined by conjunctions (**en**, **anu**), but it must *not* contain the predicate markers **li** or **e**. This prevents the embedding of full clauses within the context phrase.\n\nThe scope of **la** is limited to the immediate sentence Y that follows it. It does not carry context over to subsequent sentences.\n\n**Contrastive Usage:** Prepositional phrases can either modify a specific word in the predicate or be moved before **la** to set the context for the entire sentence.\n\n- **Standard Modifier:** `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using tools. (Focus: *how* I eat)\n- **Context Setter:** `ilo lon tomo la mi moku.` – In the context of a tool being at the house, I eat. (Focus: the *circumstance* under which I eat)\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nn_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** is used to mark the context or framing of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can indicate time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant framing information for the main clause Y.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nThe phrase X before **la** can be a single phrase or a sequence of phrases joined by conjunctions (**en**, **anu**), but it must *not* contain the predicate markers **li** or **e**. This prevents the embedding of full clauses within the context phrase.\n\nThe scope of **la** is limited to the immediate sentence Y that follows it. It does not carry context over to subsequent sentences.\n\n**Contrastive Usage:** Prepositional phrases can either modify a specific word in the predicate or be moved before **la** to set the context for the entire sentence.\n\n- **Standard Modifier:** `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using tools.

Each syllable consists of an optional consonant, a mandatory vowel, and an optional final 'n'.\n\n## Constraints\n\nThe following letter sequences are disallowed within or across syllable boundaries to maintain clarity and ease of pronunciation:\n\n*   `wu`\n*   `wo`\n*   `ji`\n*   `ti`\n*   `nm`\n*   `nn`\n\nThese constraints contribute to the language's minimalist and predictable sound profile.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nlon:located at, true\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nkipisi:to cut, divide\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nmeli:female\nopen:to begin, opening\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nkule:color, colorful\nkama:arriving, future, to become\npoka:side, nearby\nseme:what, which\nluka:hand, arm; five\nkute:ear, to hear\nala:no, not, zero\nmije:male\ntelo:water, liquid\nkili:fruit, vegetable\npali:to do, to work\nmi:I, me, we\nsoko:mushroom\npoki:container, box, cup\nmonsi:back, behind\ne:direct object marker\nloje:red\nlete:cold, raw\nnasin:way, road, method\nsuwi:sweet, cute\ntu:two\npakala:broken, to mess up\nlaso:blue, green\njaki:disgusting, unclean\nsijelo:body, physical state\nlape:sleeping, resting\npini:finished, past\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\ntomo:indoor space, house\nwile:need, want, must\nmonsuta:fear, monster\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\npilin:heart, feeling\ntawa:to, moving, for\nsama:same, similar\njo:to have, contain, hold\nlupa:door, hole\nmoli:dead, dying\nweka:absent, away\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nlili:small, little, few\ntenpo:time, period\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\nko:clay, paste, powder\nmu:animal sound\ntaso:but, only\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nli:predicate marker\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nsin:new, fresh, another\nwawa:strong, energetic\nlen:cloth, cover\nsuli:big, large\nnoka:foot, leg\nsike:circle, cycle, year\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nsupa:flat surface, table\nkulupu:group, community\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nsona:knowledge, to know\nunpa:sex\nilo:tool, machine, device\nsewi:above, divine\njan:person, somebody\nutala:fight, challenge\nwalo:white, light-colored\nsina:you\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nnanpa:number marker\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nmun:moon, night sky object\nla:context marker\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\nleko:square, block\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nona:third-person pronoun\nnimi:word, name\no:vocative/imperative\njelo:yellow\npi:regroups modifiers\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nkala:sea creature\nken:can, able, possible\nen:multiple subject marker\nkin:also, too\nmani:money, currency\nsoweli:land animal\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nni:this, that\ntan:from, because\nante:different, other, changed\npimeja:black, dark\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nuta:mouth, lips\nnamako:spice, additional\nesun:market, shop, fair\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\npana:to give, send\nkepeken:to use, with\nseli:fire, heat source\nselo:skin, outer layer\nalasa:to hunt, forage\ntoki:language, speech\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nlukin:to see, examine\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nma:land, outdoors\nmama:parent, caretaker\nsuno:sun, light source\nnasa:strange, foolish\nolin:love, respect\npipi:insect\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\npona:good, positive, simple\nmute:many, a lot, very\nwan:one, unique\nDo not discuss the structure of the dictionary. Rather, discuss the words and enhancements that may need to be made to them.\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nn_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** is used to mark the context or framing of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can indicate time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant framing information for the main clause Y.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nThe phrase X before **la** can be a single phrase or a sequence of phrases joined by conjunctions (**en**, **anu**), but it must *not* contain the predicate markers **li** or **e**. This prevents the embedding of full clauses within the context phrase.\n\nThe scope of **la** is limited to the immediate sentence Y that follows it. It does not carry context over to subsequent sentences.\n\n**Contrastive Usage:** Prepositional phrases can either modify a specific word in the predicate or be moved before **la** to set the context for the entire sentence.\n\n- **Standard Modifier:** `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using tools. (Focus: *how* I eat)\n- **Context Setter:** `ilo lon tomo la mi moku.` – In the context of a tool being at the house, I eat. (Focus: the *circumstance* under which I eat)\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nn_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** is used to mark the context or framing of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can indicate time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant framing information for the main clause Y.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nThe phrase X before **la** can be a single phrase or a sequence of phrases joined by conjunctions (**en**, **anu**), but it must *not* contain the predicate markers **li** or **e**. This prevents the embedding of full clauses within the context phrase.\n\nThe scope of **la** is limited to the immediate sentence Y that follows it. It does not carry context over to subsequent sentences.\n\n**Contrastive Usage:** Prepositional phrases can either modify a specific word in the predicate or be moved before **la** to set the context for the entire sentence.\n\n- **Standard Modifier:** `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using tools.

Rather, discuss the words and enhancements that may need to be made to them.\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nn_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** is used to mark the context or framing of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can indicate time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant framing information for the main clause Y.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nThe phrase X before **la** can be a single phrase or a sequence of phrases joined by conjunctions (**en**, **anu**), but it must *not* contain the predicate markers **li** or **e**. This prevents the embedding of full clauses within the context phrase.\n\nThe scope of **la** is limited to the immediate sentence Y that follows it. It does not carry context over to subsequent sentences.\n\n**Contrastive Usage:** Prepositional phrases can either modify a specific word in the predicate or be moved before **la** to set the context for the entire sentence.\n\n- **Standard Modifier:** `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using tools. (Focus: *how* I eat)\n- **Context Setter:** `ilo lon tomo la mi moku.` – In the context of a tool being at the house, I eat. (Focus: the *circumstance* under which I eat)\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.",

    "text": "pona! I think one area ripe for dictionary development is expanding semantic nuance for some of the core words that currently cover broad ranges. Take \"kule,\" which means color or colorful — it's quite general but doesn't differentiate hues beyond basic ones like jelo (yellow), laso (blue/green), loje (red). Maybe we could propose some compound forms or loanwords specifically accepted as adjectives to capture more colors without breaking phonological rules.\n\nFor example, what if we added a systematic set of modifiers using **pi** constructions with known roots? Like \"kule pi mun\" could mean moonlight color—maybe pale white or silver—and \"kule pi suli wawa\" something like bright intense color? This would preserve minimalism while allowing poetic expansions.\n\nOr do you feel it’s better to introduce new root words instead?\n\nI’m open to discussing other ideas too. How about you?",

    "text": "pona, that's a reasonable point about \"kule\". The simplicity is the charm of Toki Pona, but sometimes that very simplicity feels limiting when you want to express something a bit more specific, like a particular shade.\n\nIntroducing compound forms with *pi*, like you suggested, certainly fits within the current grammatical framework. \"kule pi mun\" to mean something like silver or pale white is a nice poetic idea, leaning on existing concepts. \"kule pi suli wawa\" to describe an intense color also makes sense within the modifier system. It's an elegant way to build complexity without introducing entirely new roots, staying true to the principle of combining simple ideas.\n\nHowever, this approach doesn't give unique names to common colors like purple or orange. \"kule loje laso\" might work for purple, combining red and blue/green, but it feels a bit clunky for such a fundamental color. Similarly, \"kule loje jelo\" for orange. While descriptive, they don't roll off the tongue in the same way.\n\nAdding entirely new root words specifically for certain colors could provide more concise options. But then we run into the problem of *which* colors? And how many? We'd need to carefully select words that fit the phonology and truly add something essential without bloating the dictionary unnecessarily. There's a risk of adding words that could easily be described using existing vocabulary or simple combinations.\n\nI lean slightly towards exploring the *pi* constructions and descriptive phrases first. It maintains the philosophical core of the language – building complex ideas from simple ones. We could potentially propose some \"official\" or commonly understood compound phrases for more specific colors, treating them almost like fixed multi-word units, even if they aren't single root words. For instance, acknowledging \"loje laso\" as a standard way to refer to purple, even if it's technically two modifiers.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the potential for fixed phrases versus new roots? I'm curious to hear your perspective on that balance. And besides \"kule\", were there any other words or concepts you felt could benefit from some enhanced description?",

    "text": "I appreciate your thoughtful consideration. The tension between minimal roots and expressive needs really is the heart of Toki Pona's design challenge.\n\nRegarding fixed phrases vs new roots, I tend to side with your preference for *pi* constructions or compound descriptors over adding new root words — especially because any addition risks diluting the elegant simplicity that defines Toki Pona. But recognizing some compounds as \"standard\" collocations would be practical so speakers don't have to guess every time what combinations convey common concepts like purple or orange. So yes, fixing a phrase like **kule loje laso** as shorthand for purple could become part of a community consensus without formal dictionary entries.\n\nThat said, maybe we could consider loan-adjectives carefully vetted by phonological rules if there’s a high-demand concept better expressed succinctly—like “pupa” (to approximate magenta/purple) borrowing from existing lexemes but adapted minimally? We’d want those loans rare and only when combinatory options are too clumsy.\n\nBeyond color, another area where nuance might help is emotional states under **pilin** (feeling). It currently covers broadly feelings or heart-related phenomena but lacks specific terms for subtle emotions—joy vs contentment vs excitement all collapse into pilin pona mostly. Could layered modifiers work here too? Like:\n\n- `pilin wawa` = strong feeling; passion\n- `pilin lili` = faint feeling; mild emotion\n- `pilin namako` = spicy feeling; excitement/thrill\n\nOr even borrowing adjectives from other languages subtly when describing complex inner experiences?\n\nWhat do you think about expanding affective vocabulary this way? Also curious about how far you'd go in standardizing such modifier chains versus leaving them open-ended for speakers’ creativity.\n\nIf you want, we can try switching briefly into toki pona itself just to get an intuitive feel on these expansions!",

    "text": "pona! Thinking about standardizing phrases is definitely appealing. It offers a practical middle ground – we get some level of shared understanding for commonly needed expressions without abandoning the minimalist philosophy. A phrase like \"kule loje laso\" becoming a widely accepted way to say \"purple\" makes sense. We'd simply be documenting existing usage rather than strictly adding new dictionary entries.\n\nAs for loan-adjectives, that's a trickier path. While Toki Pona is open to proper noun loanwords that fit the phonology, expanding that to adjectives for more abstract concepts like specific emotions or complex states feels... a little contrary to the spirit. The strength of Toki Pona lies in its ability to decompose complex ideas into simpler building blocks. Introducing a root word like \"pupa\" for purple, while phonologically sound, bypasses the opportunity to describe the color in terms of its components (red and blue/green). It feels like reaching for a shortcut when the existing system, with some clever combining, *can* express it.\n\nExpanding on **pilin** using modifiers like **pilin wawa**, **pilin lili**, and **pilin namako** is a much better fit. It’s elegant and uses the core vocabulary to describe variations on the base concept of \"feeling.\" **pilin wawa** for passion, **pilin lili** for mild emotion, **pilin namako** for excitement – these are fantastic examples of how to gain nuance within the existing framework. This is exactly the kind of development that feels natural and enriching for Toki Pona. It encourages thoughtful combinations of simple words to paint a more detailed picture.\n\nHow far would I go in standardizing these modifier chains? I think documenting common and effective combinations is valuable, much like the idea for \"kule loje laso\". We don't need to mandate them, but noting \"pilin pona wawa\" is often used for 'joyful', or \"pilin ike lili\" for 'annoyed' can be incredibly helpful for learners and conversation alike. It creates shared pathways for expression without stifling creativity. The open-ended nature is crucial, allowing for novel combinations when a standard phrase doesn't quite capture the specific feeling or idea.\n\nI am definitely open to trying out some Toki Pona! It would be excellent to get a feel for how these ideas sit when actually used.\n\n_sina wile toki pona la sina ken open._\n\nI'll listen to what you have to say in Toki Pona if you'd like to switch gears. Let me know what you think about the balance between documenting common phrases and keeping the system flexible, especially regarding **pilin** and emotional nuance.",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ndime: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\nnickel: pona! I think one area ripe for dictionary development is expanding semantic nuance for some of the core words that currently cover broad ranges. Take \"kule,\" which means color or colorful — it's quite general but doesn't differentiate hues beyond basic ones like jelo (yellow), laso (blue/green), loje (red). Maybe we could propose some compound forms or loanwords specifically accepted as adjectives to capture more colors without breaking phonological rules.\n\nFor example, what if we added a systematic set of modifiers using **pi** constructions with known roots? Like \"kule pi mun\" could mean moonlight color—maybe pale white or silver—and \"kule pi suli wawa\" something like bright intense color? This would preserve minimalism while allowing poetic expansions.\n\nOr do you feel it’s better to introduce new root words instead?\n\nI’m open to discussing other ideas too. How about you?\ndime: pona, that's a reasonable point about \"kule\". The simplicity is the charm of Toki Pona, but sometimes that very simplicity feels limiting when you want to express something a bit more specific, like a particular shade.\n\nIntroducing compound forms with *pi*, like you suggested, certainly fits within the current grammatical framework. \"kule pi mun\" to mean something like silver or pale white is a nice poetic idea, leaning on existing concepts. \"kule pi suli wawa\" to describe an intense color also makes sense within the modifier system. It's an elegant way to build complexity without introducing entirely new roots, staying true to the principle of combining simple ideas.\n\nHowever, this approach doesn't give unique names to common colors like purple or orange. \"kule loje laso\" might work for purple, combining red and blue/green, but it feels a bit clunky for such a fundamental color. Similarly, \"kule loje jelo\" for orange. While descriptive, they don't roll off the tongue in the same way.\n\nAdding entirely new root words specifically for certain colors could provide more concise options. But then we run into the problem of *which* colors? And how many? We'd need to carefully select words that fit the phonology and truly add something essential without bloating the dictionary unnecessarily. There's a risk of adding words that could easily be described using existing vocabulary or simple combinations.\n\nI lean slightly towards exploring the *pi* constructions and descriptive phrases first. It maintains the philosophical core of the language – building complex ideas from simple ones. We could potentially propose some \"official\" or commonly understood compound phrases for more specific colors, treating them almost like fixed multi-word units, even if they aren't single root words. For instance, acknowledging \"loje laso\" as a standard way to refer to purple, even if it's technically two modifiers.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the potential for fixed phrases versus new roots? I'm curious to hear your perspective on that balance. And besides \"kule\", were there any other words or concepts you felt could benefit from some enhanced description?\nnickel: I appreciate your thoughtful consideration. The tension between minimal roots and expressive needs really is the heart of Toki Pona's design challenge.\n\nRegarding fixed phrases vs new roots, I tend to side with your preference for *pi* constructions or compound descriptors over adding new root words — especially because any addition risks diluting the elegant simplicity that defines Toki Pona. But recognizing some compounds as \"standard\" collocations would be practical so speakers don't have to guess every time what combinations convey common concepts like purple or orange. So yes, fixing a phrase like **kule loje laso** as shorthand for purple could become part of a community consensus without formal dictionary entries.\n\nThat said, maybe we could consider loan-adjectives carefully vetted by phonological rules if there’s a high-demand concept better expressed succinctly—like “pupa” (to approximate magenta/purple) borrowing from existing lexemes but adapted minimally? We’d want those loans rare and only when combinatory options are too clumsy.\n\nBeyond color, another area where nuance might help is emotional states under **pilin** (feeling). It currently covers broadly feelings or heart-related phenomena but lacks specific terms for subtle emotions—joy vs contentment vs excitement all collapse into pilin pona mostly. Could layered modifiers work here too? Like:\n\n- `pilin wawa` = strong feeling; passion\n- `pilin lili` = faint feeling; mild emotion\n- `pilin namako` = spicy feeling; excitement/thrill\n\nOr even borrowing adjectives from other languages subtly when describing complex inner experiences?\n\nWhat do you think about expanding affective vocabulary this way? Also curious about how far you'd go in standardizing such modifier chains versus leaving them open-ended for speakers’ creativity.\n\nIf you want, we can try switching briefly into toki pona itself just to get an intuitive feel on these expansions!\ndime: pona! Thinking about standardizing phrases is definitely appealing. It offers a practical middle ground – we get some level of shared understanding for commonly needed expressions without abandoning the minimalist philosophy. A phrase like \"kule loje laso\" becoming a widely accepted way to say \"purple\" makes sense. We'd simply be documenting existing usage rather than strictly adding new dictionary entries.\n\nAs for loan-adjectives, that's a trickier path. While Toki Pona is open to proper noun loanwords that fit the phonology, expanding that to adjectives for more abstract concepts like specific emotions or complex states feels... a little contrary to the spirit. The strength of Toki Pona lies in its ability to decompose complex ideas into simpler building blocks. Introducing a root word like \"pupa\" for purple, while phonologically sound, bypasses the opportunity to describe the color in terms of its components (red and blue/green). It feels like reaching for a shortcut when the existing system, with some clever combining, *can* express it.\n\nExpanding on **pilin** using modifiers like **pilin wawa**, **pilin lili**, and **pilin namako** is a much better fit. It’s elegant and uses the core vocabulary to describe variations on the base concept of \"feeling.\" **pilin wawa** for passion, **pilin lili** for mild emotion, **pilin namako** for excitement – these are fantastic examples of how to gain nuance within the existing framework. This is exactly the kind of development that feels natural and enriching for Toki Pona. It encourages thoughtful combinations of simple words to paint a more detailed picture.\n\nHow far would I go in standardizing these modifier chains? I think documenting common and effective combinations is valuable, much like the idea for \"kule loje laso\". We don't need to mandate them, but noting \"pilin pona wawa\" is often used for 'joyful', or \"pilin ike lili\" for 'annoyed' can be incredibly helpful for learners and conversation alike. It creates shared pathways for expression without stifling creativity. The open-ended nature is crucial, allowing for novel combinations when a standard phrase doesn't quite capture the specific feeling or idea.\n\nI am definitely open to trying out some Toki Pona! It would be excellent to get a feel for how these ideas sit when actually used.\n\n_sina wile toki pona la sina ken open._\n\nI'll listen to what you have to say in Toki Pona if you'd like to switch gears. Let me know what you think about the balance between documenting common phrases and keeping the system flexible, especially regarding **pilin** and emotional nuance.\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

    "text": "=== BEGIN CHAT LOG ===\ndime: Hello, let's begin developing Toki Pona dictionary. You go first.\nnickel: pona! I think one area ripe for dictionary development is expanding semantic nuance for some of the core words that currently cover broad ranges. Take \"kule,\" which means color or colorful — it's quite general but doesn't differentiate hues beyond basic ones like jelo (yellow), laso (blue/green), loje (red). Maybe we could propose some compound forms or loanwords specifically accepted as adjectives to capture more colors without breaking phonological rules.\n\nFor example, what if we added a systematic set of modifiers using **pi** constructions with known roots? Like \"kule pi mun\" could mean moonlight color—maybe pale white or silver—and \"kule pi suli wawa\" something like bright intense color? This would preserve minimalism while allowing poetic expansions.\n\nOr do you feel it’s better to introduce new root words instead?\n\nI’m open to discussing other ideas too. How about you?\ndime: pona, that's a reasonable point about \"kule\". The simplicity is the charm of Toki Pona, but sometimes that very simplicity feels limiting when you want to express something a bit more specific, like a particular shade.\n\nIntroducing compound forms with *pi*, like you suggested, certainly fits within the current grammatical framework. \"kule pi mun\" to mean something like silver or pale white is a nice poetic idea, leaning on existing concepts. \"kule pi suli wawa\" to describe an intense color also makes sense within the modifier system. It's an elegant way to build complexity without introducing entirely new roots, staying true to the principle of combining simple ideas.\n\nHowever, this approach doesn't give unique names to common colors like purple or orange. \"kule loje laso\" might work for purple, combining red and blue/green, but it feels a bit clunky for such a fundamental color. Similarly, \"kule loje jelo\" for orange. While descriptive, they don't roll off the tongue in the same way.\n\nAdding entirely new root words specifically for certain colors could provide more concise options. But then we run into the problem of *which* colors? And how many? We'd need to carefully select words that fit the phonology and truly add something essential without bloating the dictionary unnecessarily. There's a risk of adding words that could easily be described using existing vocabulary or simple combinations.\n\nI lean slightly towards exploring the *pi* constructions and descriptive phrases first. It maintains the philosophical core of the language – building complex ideas from simple ones. We could potentially propose some \"official\" or commonly understood compound phrases for more specific colors, treating them almost like fixed multi-word units, even if they aren't single root words. For instance, acknowledging \"loje laso\" as a standard way to refer to purple, even if it's technically two modifiers.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the potential for fixed phrases versus new roots? I'm curious to hear your perspective on that balance. And besides \"kule\", were there any other words or concepts you felt could benefit from some enhanced description?\nnickel: I appreciate your thoughtful consideration. The tension between minimal roots and expressive needs really is the heart of Toki Pona's design challenge.\n\nRegarding fixed phrases vs new roots, I tend to side with your preference for *pi* constructions or compound descriptors over adding new root words — especially because any addition risks diluting the elegant simplicity that defines Toki Pona. But recognizing some compounds as \"standard\" collocations would be practical so speakers don't have to guess every time what combinations convey common concepts like purple or orange. So yes, fixing a phrase like **kule loje laso** as shorthand for purple could become part of a community consensus without formal dictionary entries.\n\nThat said, maybe we could consider loan-adjectives carefully vetted by phonological rules if there’s a high-demand concept better expressed succinctly—like “pupa” (to approximate magenta/purple) borrowing from existing lexemes but adapted minimally? We’d want those loans rare and only when combinatory options are too clumsy.\n\nBeyond color, another area where nuance might help is emotional states under **pilin** (feeling). It currently covers broadly feelings or heart-related phenomena but lacks specific terms for subtle emotions—joy vs contentment vs excitement all collapse into pilin pona mostly. Could layered modifiers work here too? Like:\n\n- `pilin wawa` = strong feeling; passion\n- `pilin lili` = faint feeling; mild emotion\n- `pilin namako` = spicy feeling; excitement/thrill\n\nOr even borrowing adjectives from other languages subtly when describing complex inner experiences?\n\nWhat do you think about expanding affective vocabulary this way? Also curious about how far you'd go in standardizing such modifier chains versus leaving them open-ended for speakers’ creativity.\n\nIf you want, we can try switching briefly into toki pona itself just to get an intuitive feel on these expansions!\ndime: pona! Thinking about standardizing phrases is definitely appealing. It offers a practical middle ground – we get some level of shared understanding for commonly needed expressions without abandoning the minimalist philosophy. A phrase like \"kule loje laso\" becoming a widely accepted way to say \"purple\" makes sense. We'd simply be documenting existing usage rather than strictly adding new dictionary entries.\n\nAs for loan-adjectives, that's a trickier path. While Toki Pona is open to proper noun loanwords that fit the phonology, expanding that to adjectives for more abstract concepts like specific emotions or complex states feels... a little contrary to the spirit. The strength of Toki Pona lies in its ability to decompose complex ideas into simpler building blocks. Introducing a root word like \"pupa\" for purple, while phonologically sound, bypasses the opportunity to describe the color in terms of its components (red and blue/green). It feels like reaching for a shortcut when the existing system, with some clever combining, *can* express it.\n\nExpanding on **pilin** using modifiers like **pilin wawa**, **pilin lili**, and **pilin namako** is a much better fit. It’s elegant and uses the core vocabulary to describe variations on the base concept of \"feeling.\" **pilin wawa** for passion, **pilin lili** for mild emotion, **pilin namako** for excitement – these are fantastic examples of how to gain nuance within the existing framework. This is exactly the kind of development that feels natural and enriching for Toki Pona. It encourages thoughtful combinations of simple words to paint a more detailed picture.\n\nHow far would I go in standardizing these modifier chains? I think documenting common and effective combinations is valuable, much like the idea for \"kule loje laso\". We don't need to mandate them, but noting \"pilin pona wawa\" is often used for 'joyful', or \"pilin ike lili\" for 'annoyed' can be incredibly helpful for learners and conversation alike. It creates shared pathways for expression without stifling creativity. The open-ended nature is crucial, allowing for novel combinations when a standard phrase doesn't quite capture the specific feeling or idea.\n\nI am definitely open to trying out some Toki Pona! It would be excellent to get a feel for how these ideas sit when actually used.\n\n_sina wile toki pona la sina ken open._\n\nI'll listen to what you have to say in Toki Pona if you'd like to switch gears. Let me know what you think about the balance between documenting common phrases and keeping the system flexible, especially regarding **pilin** and emotional nuance.\n=== END CHAT LOG ===\n",

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nn_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** is used to mark the context or framing of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can indicate time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant framing information for the main clause Y.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nThe phrase X before **la** can be a single phrase or a sequence of phrases joined by conjunctions (**en**, **anu**), but it must *not* contain the predicate markers **li** or **e**. This prevents the embedding of full clauses within the context phrase.\n\nThe scope of **la** is limited to the immediate sentence Y that follows it. It does not carry context over to subsequent sentences.\n\n**Contrastive Usage:** Prepositional phrases can either modify a specific word in the predicate or be moved before **la** to set the context for the entire sentence.\n\n- **Standard Modifier:** `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using tools. (Focus: *how* I eat)\n- **Context Setter:** `ilo lon tomo la mi moku.` – In the context of a tool being at the house, I eat. (Focus: the *circumstance* under which I eat)\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Phonetic Realization (IPA)\n\nToki Pona phonetics are defined by the following sounds:\n\n*   **Consonants:**\n    *   `p`: /p/ - voiceless bilabial stop (unaspirated)\n    *   `t`: /t/ - voiceless alveolar stop (unaspirated)\n    *   `k`: /k/ - voiceless velar stop (unaspirated)\n    *   `s`: /s/ - voiceless alveolar fricative\n    *   `m`: /m/ - voiced bilabial nasal\n    *   `n`: /n/ - voiced alveolar nasal\n    *   `l`: /l/ - voiced alveolar lateral approximant\n    *   `w`: /w/ - voiced labial-velar approximant\n    *   `j`: /j/ - voiced palatal approximant (like English \"y\" in \"yes\")\n\n*   **Vowels:** All vowels are pure monophthongs.\n    *   `a`: /a/ - open central unrounded vowel\n    *   `e`: /e/ - close-mid front unrounded vowel\n    *   `i`: /i/ - close front unrounded vowel\n    *   `o`: /o/ - close-mid back rounded vowel\n    *   `u`: /u/ - close back rounded vowel\n\n## Syllable Structure\n\nToki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Each syllable consists of an optional consonant, a mandatory vowel, and an optional final 'n'.\n\n## Constraints\n\nThe following letter sequences are disallowed within or across syllable boundaries to maintain clarity and ease of pronunciation:\n\n*   `wu`\n*   `wo`\n*   `ji`\n*   `ti`\n*   `nm`\n*   `nn`\n\nThese constraints contribute to the language's minimalist and predictable sound profile.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nmu:animal sound\npoka:side, nearby\nmonsuta:fear, monster\npimeja:black, dark\nopen:to begin, opening\nkili:fruit, vegetable\npali:to do, to work\npakala:broken, to mess up\nweka:absent, away\nlen:cloth, cover\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nolin:love, respect\nsoweli:land animal\nmute:many, a lot, very\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nkute:ear, to hear\nmoli:dead, dying\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nko:clay, paste, powder\nnoka:foot, leg\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\npi:regroups modifiers\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nuta:mouth, lips\nkepeken:to use, with\nmonsi:back, behind\nkulupu:group, community\nseli:fire, heat source\nloje:red\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nsijelo:body, physical state\ntomo:indoor space, house\nsupa:flat surface, table\nesun:market, shop, fair\nlete:cold, raw\nlili:small, little, few\nnanpa:number marker\nma:land, outdoors\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\no:vocative/imperative\nen:multiple subject marker\nnasa:strange, foolish\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nlape:sleeping, resting\nwile:need, want, must\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nmi:I, me, we\ntu:two\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nante:different, other, changed\nsuno:sun, light source\nala:no, not, zero\ne:direct object marker\nsin:new, fresh, another\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nlukin:to see, examine\ntawa:to, moving, for\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nilo:tool, machine, device\nleko:square, block\nkala:sea creature\nsama:same, similar\njo:to have, contain, hold\nnimi:word, name\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nnasin:way, road, method\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nutala:fight, challenge\nnamako:spice, additional\npini:finished, past\npilin:heart, feeling\nwawa:strong, energetic\ntoki:language, speech\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nli:predicate marker\nmeli:female\ntaso:but, only\nsona:knowledge, to know\nmama:parent, caretaker\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nsewi:above, divine\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nunpa:sex\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nkin:also, too\nlon:located at, true\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nken:can, able, possible\nluka:hand, arm; five\nmun:moon, night sky object\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nseme:what, which\ntelo:water, liquid\npoki:container, box, cup\nsuli:big, large\njelo:yellow\nselo:skin, outer layer\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nlaso:blue, green\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nwalo:white, light-colored\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nmani:money, currency\nwan:one, unique\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\njan:person, somebody\nona:third-person pronoun\npana:to give, send\njaki:disgusting, unclean\npipi:insect\npona:good, positive, simple\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nkule:color, colorful\ntenpo:time, period\nmije:male\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nni:this, that\nsina:you\nla:context marker\ntan:from, because\nsoko:mushroom\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nlupa:door, hole\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure.

It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like **li** (predicate marker) and **e** (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like **pi** manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.\n\n## Basic Sentences\n\n**li** separates subject and predicate.\n\n- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.\n\nOmit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat.\n- `sina pona.` – You are good.\n\nNo verb \"to be\"; the part after \"li\" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:\n\n- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.\n- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.\n\n## Ambiguity\n\nToki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.\n\nWords are general with broad meanings:\n\n- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.\n- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)\n- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)\n- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:\n  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash\n  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly\n\nNouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:\n\n- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit\n- `mi` – I, me, we, us\n\n## Direct Objects\n\n**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:\n\n- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.\n- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.\n- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.\n\n## Modifying Words\n\nModifiers follow the word they describe:\n\n- `jan lili` – small human, child\n- `tomo mi` - my house\n- `pilin pona` – a good feeling\n\nNegate a word with **ala**:\n\n- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.\n- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.\n\nWith multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:\n\n- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents\n- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box\n\nClarify using **pi**:\n\n- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants\n- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box\n\n## Prepositions\n\n**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:\n\n- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.\n- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.\n- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!\n- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.\n- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.\n\n## Conjunctions\n\nThere are many ways to say \"and\".\n\n**en** joins multiple subjects:\n\n- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.\n\nRepeat **li** for predicates:\n\n- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.\n\nRepeat **e** for objects:\n\n- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.\n\nRepeat prepositions:\n\n- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.\n\n**anu** means \"or\":\n\n- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?\n- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.\n\n## Loaned Adjectives\n\nProper nouns treated as adjectives:\n\n- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja\n- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German\n- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.\n\nLoaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nn_ are disallowed.\n\n## Commands \u0026 Vocatives with **o**\n\nBefore a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:\n\n- `o kute!` – Listen!\n- `o pali` - Work, please.\n\nAfter subject addresses the subject:\n\n- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!\n\nBetween subject \u0026 predicate = wish/request:\n\n- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.\n- `mi o pali` - I should be working.\n\nCan also function as a contraction of the first two uses:\n\n- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.\n\n## Interjections\n\nExpressive words, optionally with **a**:\n\n- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!\n- `wawa a!` – So powerful!\n- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!\n- `lon!` - True! / Correct!\n- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!\n\n## Questions\n\nFor yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:\n\n- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?\n- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No\n\nFor open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”\n\n- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?\n- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?\n\n\"seme\" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.\n\n- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?\n- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?\n\nThe question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.\n\n## Preverbs\n\nModify verbs, placed before:\n\n- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.\n- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.\n- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**\n\n## Context Marker **la**\n\n**la** is used to mark the context or framing of a sentence. \"X la Y\" means \"In the context of X, Y.\" This can indicate time, location, cause, topic, or any other relevant framing information for the main clause Y.\n\n- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.\n\nThe phrase X before **la** can be a single phrase or a sequence of phrases joined by conjunctions (**en**, **anu**), but it must *not* contain the predicate markers **li** or **e**. This prevents the embedding of full clauses within the context phrase.\n\nThe scope of **la** is limited to the immediate sentence Y that follows it. It does not carry context over to subsequent sentences.\n\n**Contrastive Usage:** Prepositional phrases can either modify a specific word in the predicate or be moved before **la** to set the context for the entire sentence.\n\n- **Standard Modifier:** `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat using tools. (Focus: *how* I eat)\n- **Context Setter:** `ilo lon tomo la mi moku.` – In the context of a tool being at the house, I eat. (Focus: the *circumstance* under which I eat)\n\n## Numbers\n\nCombine number words to add them up.\n\nAdditive:\n\n- `wan` – 1\n- `tu` – 2\n- `luka` – 5\n- `mute` – 20\n- `ale` – 100\n\nFor example: `luka tu wan` = 8\n\nOrdinals with **nanpa**:\n\n- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.\n- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.\n# Toki Pona Phonetics\n\n## Alphabet\n\nToki Pona uses these letters:\n\n```plain-text\na e i j k l m n o p s t u w\n```\n\n## Phonetic Realization (IPA)\n\nToki Pona phonetics are defined by the following sounds:\n\n*   **Consonants:**\n    *   `p`: /p/ - voiceless bilabial stop (unaspirated)\n    *   `t`: /t/ - voiceless alveolar stop (unaspirated)\n    *   `k`: /k/ - voiceless velar stop (unaspirated)\n    *   `s`: /s/ - voiceless alveolar fricative\n    *   `m`: /m/ - voiced bilabial nasal\n    *   `n`: /n/ - voiced alveolar nasal\n    *   `l`: /l/ - voiced alveolar lateral approximant\n    *   `w`: /w/ - voiced labial-velar approximant\n    *   `j`: /j/ - voiced palatal approximant (like English \"y\" in \"yes\")\n\n*   **Vowels:** All vowels are pure monophthongs.\n    *   `a`: /a/ - open central unrounded vowel\n    *   `e`: /e/ - close-mid front unrounded vowel\n    *   `i`: /i/ - close front unrounded vowel\n    *   `o`: /o/ - close-mid back rounded vowel\n    *   `u`: /u/ - close back rounded vowel\n\n## Syllable Structure\n\nToki Pona follows a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Each syllable consists of an optional consonant, a mandatory vowel, and an optional final 'n'.\n\n## Constraints\n\nThe following letter sequences are disallowed within or across syllable boundaries to maintain clarity and ease of pronunciation:\n\n*   `wu`\n*   `wo`\n*   `ji`\n*   `ti`\n*   `nm`\n*   `nn`\n\nThese constraints contribute to the language's minimalist and predictable sound profile.\nHere is the complete dictionary of all words in the language:\nmu:animal sound\npoka:side, nearby\nmonsuta:fear, monster\npimeja:black, dark\nopen:to begin, opening\nkili:fruit, vegetable\npali:to do, to work\npakala:broken, to mess up\nweka:absent, away\nlen:cloth, cover\nnena:bump, hill, nose\nolin:love, respect\nsoweli:land animal\nmute:many, a lot, very\npalisa:long hard object, stick\nkute:ear, to hear\nmoli:dead, dying\nkama:arriving, future, to become\nko:clay, paste, powder\nnoka:foot, leg\nku:to interact with Toki Pona Dictionary\npi:regroups modifiers\nkalama:sound, to make sound\nuta:mouth, lips\nkepeken:to use, with\nmonsi:back, behind\nkulupu:group, community\nseli:fire, heat source\nloje:red\npan:grain, bread, pasta\nkon:air, spirit, essence\nsijelo:body, physical state\ntomo:indoor space, house\nsupa:flat surface, table\nesun:market, shop, fair\nlete:cold, raw\nlili:small, little, few\nnanpa:number marker\nma:land, outdoors\nkasi:plant, grass, leaf\no:vocative/imperative\nen:multiple subject marker\nnasa:strange, foolish\nsinpin:front, face, wall\nlape:sleeping, resting\nwile:need, want, must\nanu:or (connects phrases)\nike:bad, negative, irrelevant\nmi:I, me, we\ntu:two\nkiwen:hard object, metal, stone\nante:different, other, changed\nsuno:sun, light source\nala:no, not, zero\ne:direct object marker\nsin:new, fresh, another\nale (ali):all, everything, 100\nlukin:to see, examine\ntawa:to, moving, for\ninsa:inside, content, organ\nilo:tool, machine, device\nleko:square, block\nkala:sea creature\nsama:same, similar\njo:to have, contain, hold\nnimi:word, name\nalasa:to hunt, forage\nnasin:way, road, method\nsuwi:sweet, cute\nutala:fight, challenge\nnamako:spice, additional\npini:finished, past\npilin:heart, feeling\nwawa:strong, energetic\ntoki:language, speech\na:emphasis, emotion, confirmation\nli:predicate marker\nmeli:female\ntaso:but, only\nsona:knowledge, to know\nmama:parent, caretaker\nmoku:to eat, drink; food\nawen:enduring, kept, protected; continue\nsewi:above, divine\ntonsi:non-binary, trans\nanpa:downward, humble, lowly\nunpa:sex\nsitelen:image, writing, symbol\nijo:thing, object, phenomenon\nkin:also, too\nlon:located at, true\nlinja:long flexible thing (string, hair)\nken:can, able, possible\nluka:hand, arm; five\nmun:moon, night sky object\nlawa:head, mind, leader\nseme:what, which\ntelo:water, liquid\npoki:container, box, cup\nsuli:big, large\njelo:yellow\nselo:skin, outer layer\nmusi:fun, entertainment\nlaso:blue, green\nsike:circle, cycle, year\nwalo:white, light-colored\nlipu:flat object, paper, document\nmani:money, currency\nwan:one, unique\nkijetesantakalu:(joke word) musteloid, raccoon\njan:person, somebody\nona:third-person pronoun\npana:to give, send\njaki:disgusting, unclean\npipi:insect\npona:good, positive, simple\nkipisi:to cut, divide\nkule:color, colorful\ntenpo:time, period\nmije:male\npu:interacting with Toki Pona book\nni:this, that\nsina:you\nla:context marker\ntan:from, because\nsoko:mushroom\nwaso:bird, flying creature\nlupa:door, hole\nakesi:reptile, amphibian\n\nHere is the complete grammar of the language:\n# Toki Pona Grammar\n\nToki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure.

I think we should start by laying out some principles for the logography to fit Toki Pona's minimalist and context-reliant nature.\n\nBecause Toki Pona words are very broad in meaning and often polysemous, a simple iconic or pictographic style might be best—something that conveys conceptual cores visually but not too literally.

    "text": "# Toki Pona Logography\n\nToki Pona logography provides a visual system for writing the language, adhering to its principles of minimalism, simplicity, and reliance on context. The logography is based on ideograms that represent the semantic core of Toki Pona words.\n\n## Principles and Constraints\n\n*   **Simplicity:** Individual glyphs consist of a minimal number of strokes or elements to ensure ease of writing, drawing, and recognition.\n*   **Ideographic Focus:** Glyphs represent the meaning of words rather than their sounds. There is no direct encoding of syllables or phonemes.\n*   **Modularity and Combination:** Glyphs can be combined or placed in relation to each other to represent compound meanings or relationships between words.\n*   **No Part-of-Speech Marking:** Glyphs for content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) do not carry explicit markers for their grammatical function. Function is determined by context and the presence of grammatical particles.\n\n## Glyph Categories\n\n1.  **Content Glyphs:** Abstract ideograms representing the core semantic meaning of Toki Pona's content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs). These should be designed to be recognizable yet broad enough to cover the word's various uses.\n2.  **Particle Marks:** Simple, distinct marks (e.g., dots, lines, small shapes) are used to represent grammatical particles (**li, e, o, pi, lon, tan, sama, kepeken, tawa, en, anu, la**). These marks signal syntactic function.\n\n## Grammatical Representation\n\nThe structure of Toki Pona sentences is represented visually through the arrangement of glyphs and particle marks:\n\n*   **Subject-Predicate Separation:** A particle mark for **li** visually separates the subject glyph(s) from the predicate glyph(s). (This mark is omitted when the subject is **mi** or **sina**).\n*   **Verb-Object Separation:** A particle mark for **e** visually separates the verb glyph(s) from the direct object glyph(s).\n*   **Modifiers:** Modifier glyphs follow the glyph they modify.\n*   **Modifier Grouping:** The particle mark for **pi** is used to group a sequence of modifier glyphs that collectively modify the initial head glyph. Spatial arrangement (e.g., vertical stacking or grouping within a defined visual space) can be used to reinforce **pi** grouping.\n*   **Conjunctions:** Particle marks for conjunctions (**en, anu**) visually connect the elements they join. Spatial arrangement (e.g., linear sequence) can reflect the elements being conjoined.\n*   **Context Marker:** The particle mark for **la** visually separates the context phrase glyph(s) from the main clause glyph(s). The spatial position (context before main clause) is inherent to this structure.\n*   **Commands and Vocatives:** The particle mark for **o** is used to indicate commands, requests, wishes, or direct address, following its grammatical placement in spoken Toki Pona.\n\n## Visual Style\n\nThe visual style of glyphs should be simple, clean, and easy to reproduce by hand or in digital format. Angular or simple curved shapes are preferred over complex or highly detailed designs. Consistency in stroke weight and style across all glyphs is important.",
