# Toki Pona Grammar

Toki Pona is an isolating language with a simple SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure. It lacks inflectional morphology, using particles like li (predicate marker) and e (direct object marker) to indicate syntactic roles. Modifiers follow head nouns and adjectives, resulting in a strict head-initial phrase structure. Ambiguity is resolved through context rather than morphological marking; for example, it lacks tense, number, or definiteness markers. Function words like pi manage modifier grouping, and prepositions are post-posed. Predicates are flexible, allowing words to shift freely between noun, verb, and adjective roles without morphological change.

## Basic Sentences

**li** separates subject and predicate.

- `soweli li moku.` – The cat is eating.

Omit **li** if subject is **mi** or **sina**:

- `mi moku.` – I eat.
- `sina pona.` – You are good.

No verb "to be"; the part after "li" (predicate) can be a noun or an adjective:

- `kili li moku.` – Fruits are food.
- `telo li pona.` – Water is good.

## Ambiguity

Toki Pona words are less specific than English words, so a one-to-one translation is not as easy.

Words are general with broad meanings:

- `mi moku.` – I eat. / I was eating. / I will be eating.
- `soweli` – any land mammal (cat, dog, any land animal)
- `kili` - (any fruit or vegetable)
- Most words can be used as noun, verb, adj, adv:
  - `telo` – water, wet, to wash
  - `pona` – good, simple / to improve, to make better / well, greatly

Nouns have no default countability. They also do not have any default identifiability:

- `kili` – a fruit / the fruit / fruits / some fruit
- `mi` – I, me, we, us

## Direct Objects

**e** separates verb and direct object. This also makes the word before into a verb:

- `soweli li moku e telo.` – The animal drinks the water.
- `mi telo e soweli.` – I wash the cat. / I apply water to the cat.
- `sina suli e ona` - You embiggen it. / You make it big.

## Modifying Words

Modifiers follow the word they describe:

- `jan lili` – small human, child
- `tomo mi` - my house
- `pilin pona` – a good feeling

Negate a word with **ala**:

- `mi lape ala.` – I'm not sleeping.
- `jan ala li toki.` - No one is talking.

With multiple modifiers, they all modify the first word:

- `lipu kasi tu` – two plant documents
- `poki laso pimeja` - a blue and black box

Clarify using **pi**:

- `lipu pi kasi tu` – document of two plants
- `poki pi laso pimeja` - a dark-blue box

## Prepositions

**kepeken, lon, sama, tan, tawa** are prepositions that go at the end of a statement:

- `mi moku kepeken ilo.` – I eat with cutlery.
- `soweli li lon tomo.` – The animal is in the house.
- `sina toki sama kala!` - You talk like a fish!
- `mi kama tan esun` - I arrive from the store.
- `ona li toki e ni tawa sina` - They said this to you.

## Conjunctions

There are many ways to say "and".

**en** joins multiple subjects:

- `mi en sina li musi mute.` – You and I are playing a lot.

Repeat **li** for predicates:

- `soweli li lili li suwi.` – The animal is small and cute.

Repeat **e** for objects:

- `ona li jo e waso e kala.` – She has a bird and a fish.

Repeat prepositions:

- `mi pali e tomo kepeken palisa kepeken kiwen.` – I make the house with sticks and stones.

**anu** means "or":

- `ni li pona anu ike?` – Is this good or bad?
- `mi anu sina li tawa esun` - You or I are going to the store.

## Loaned Adjectives

Proper nouns treated as adjectives:

- `jan Sonja` – a Sonja person, a person named Sonja
- `toki Tosi` – a Tosi (Deutsch) language, German
- `ma Mewika li suli` - The US is big.

Loaned adjectives should follow Toki Pona's phonology. Toki Pona uses a (C)V(n) syllable structure. Vowel clusters, consonant clusters, and the sequences _wu, wo ji, ti, nm_, and _nm_ are disallowed.

## Commands & Vocatives with **o**

Before a verb, _o_ turns it into a command:

- `o kute!` – Listen!
- `o pali` - Work, please.

After subject addresses the subject:

- `jan Pape o!` – O Pape!

Between subject & predicate = wish/request:

- `pona o tawa sina.` – I wish for goodness to go to you.
- `mi o pali` - I should be working.

Can also function as a contraction of the first two uses:

- `soweli Ton o moku` - Eat, Ton.

## Interjections

Expressive words, optionally with **a**:

- `pona!` – Good! / Great! / Thanks!
- `wawa a!` – So powerful!
- `toki!` - Hello! / Hi! / Greetings!
- `lon!` - True! / Correct!
- `moku pona!` – Bon appétit! / What a fantastic meal!

## Questions

For yes/no questions: **verb ala verb**:

- `sina moku ala moku?` – Are you eating?
- To say yes, repeat the verb. To say no, say “verb ala” or “ala.” - `moku.` – Yes - `moku ala.` / `ala.` – No

For open-ended questions, you can also use “anu seme.”

- `sina moku anu seme?` – Are you eating?
- `kala anu seme li l on poki?`- Are fish in the box?

"seme" can also be used to create nonpolar questions. Replace the word in question with seme.

- `jan seme li toki?` – Who’s talking?
- `sina pali e seme?` – What are you making?

The question mark is a stylistic choice. Toki Pona uses grammar to mark questions, not tone or punctuation. In general, all you need for punctuation is to separate sentences.

## Preverbs

Modify verbs, placed before:

- `mi kama sona.` – I come to know.
- `waso lili li wile suli` - The small bird wants to be big.
- Common preverbs: **wile, kama, sona, lukin, ken, awen, alasa**

## Context Marker **la**

"la" can be used to mark the context of a sentence. "X la Y" means "In the context of X, Y." This can mean time, cause, topic, or any other relationship to the main sentence.

- `sina lon poka mi la mi pilin pona.` - When you are by my side, I feel good.

Most prepositional terms can be moved behind a "la".

- `mi lape lon tenpo pimeja. tenpo pimeja la mi lape.` - I sleep at night.
- `sina seli tan seme? tan seme la sina seli?` - Why are you hot?

## Numbers

Combine number words to add them up.

Additive:

- `wan` – 1
- `tu` – 2
- `luka` – 5
- `mute` – 20
- `ale` – 100

For example: `luka tu wan` = 8

Ordinals with **nanpa**:

- `jan nanpa wan` – The first person.
- `ni li nasin nanpa mute tu wan.` - That is 23rd Street.
