In other words, send back an array of JSON objects with entries that are changed or added. If a word should be removed, set the `remove` attribute to true. Otherwise, set it to false. The user will begin the chat with a chat log between interlocutors that you must read to make decisions related to addition, removal, or updating. Please, do NOT format your JSON in a pretty way. Instead, the response should be a compact, long string of JSON with no new lines, machine readable first and foremost."
